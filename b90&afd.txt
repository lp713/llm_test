 Dear voters 
 and voters, 
On June 9, 2024, you have the choice. We are faced with the decision as to whether we will receive what we
and strengthen that which protects us. Nothing less than our peace and prosperity is at stake. This is the basis for social and societal cohesion in a united Europe.
Where we come from: a Europe that creates peace
It is the greatest achievement of our continent: where just a few decades ago Europeans fought against each other on the battlefield, trust and cohesion now prevail. Where once front lines and barbed wire separated us, and later walls and border posts, we are now united by our commitment to freedom, the rule of law and democracy.
Enemies have become neighbors, neighbors have long since become friends.
In a world full of conflicts, the idea of the European Union stands as a guarantor of protection and peace: it was not so long ago that many still took this for granted. This certainty was shattered at the latest with the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.
This war is directed against the will of Ukrainians to live in peace and freedom. It is directed against their desire to be and remain part of the European family. But it is also directed against internationally enshrined European values such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights - and reminds us of the protection the European Union offers us all. In order to preserve this protection, these values must also be upheld in the European Union.
every day. This also means issuing a clear rejection of anti-democratic, nationalist and right-wing extremist forces.
In a world whose challenges do not stop at national borders, a strong and united Europe can provide the security and prosperity that so many people long for and assume responsibility as a global player. If we strengthen freedom, democracy and human rights internally, the European Union can also convincingly represent them externally as a fair and responsible partner in the global community.
Where the assertiveness of the individual nation state ends, that of the European Union only begins.
Against this backdrop, we want to protect Europe so that it protects us. We want to strengthen it because it makes us strong. We want to secure its ability to act in order to preserve freedom.
Where we want to go: a Europe that increases prosperity for all
Peace and prosperity are inextricably linked in the European idea. Moreover, their linkage was the starting point of European unification: The interests of the individual states were to be so closely interwoven that war would henceforth be "not only unthinkable, but materially impossible".
It was a gamble. And it succeeded. From the ruins of war and destruction emerged a political order with shared values, based on democracy and the rule of law.
on freedom and solidarity - the indispensable complement to economic unification.
Now we are facing the next big task. Growing tensions in the world, social injustice, technological change and the climate crisis as a catalyst for all of this: they present us and our society, the economy and politics with new challenges. We must therefore do more than simply maintain existing prosperity. We define prosperity in terms of fairness, climate neutrality, quality of life and provision. This is the foundation for personal financial security and a life in dignity. We must now move forward where the jobs and prosperity of the coming decades will be created, create social security and at the same time preserve our natural resources. In this way, we can turn the promise of prosperity for all Europeans into reality.
Strengthening Europe and protecting the climate is therefore not an end in itself; we do it to protect and increase your prosperity, freedom and security.
We want to create an infrastructure union: of solar plants and wind farms, of hydrogen networks and fiber optic lines, of power lines and railways, but also of modern hospitals and educational facilities
- of institutions and standards that strengthen justice and protect your rights, for consumer protection and fair wages, against arbitrariness and exploitation. An infrastructure union that brings us closer together in Europe and
more sustainably, thus strengthening our cohesion and enabling innovation and progress. We want to connect Europe quite literally.
The climate crisis is global and must be solved globally. At a time when China and the USA in particular are finally investing massively in the climate-neutral modernization of their economies, we need an equally formative, strategic European investment policy to ensure that Europe can compete internationally and become the first climate-neutral business location. For such a policy, we need investments that
but it pays off. When we protect the climate socially and ecologically, we create: good jobs, clean infrastructure and secure prosperity.
However, good policy not only builds infrastructure, but also reduces bureaucracy: it regulates where necessary to safeguard the common good, maintains important standards of protection and participation
- at the same time, however, turns back unnecessary regulation that slows down the economy and society, inhibits investment and makes everyday life more difficult.
Digitalization that serves people and the harmonization of regulations and standards at different levels and countries, as made possible by the European Union, will help.
By securing the competitiveness of our companies in the markets of the future, we are laying the foundations for good jobs and fair wages, for attracting skilled workers and employees and for security in uncertain times. We don't just want to increase our prosperity for the few, we want to ensure that it reaches the many: across the breadth of society.
We pursue this claim.
By putting our prosperity on a climate-neutral footing and using fewer resources, we are protecting perhaps our most critical infrastructure: our environment and our climate, our biodiversity and the diverse nature of which we are a part. We have felt the consequences of climate change more and more drastically in Europe and around the world i n	recent years. Extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods have cost lives, homes and harvests, prosperity
and jobs destroyed. The extinction of species and the pollution of nature are endangering the ecosystems on which we are directly dependent. It is also in our own best interest to stop this trend: That is why we want to protect the climate, but also protect ourselves from the changing climatic conditions and adapt to them. We have taken important steps in this direction with the European Green Deal. We want to continue along this path.
By investing in the locational advantages of tomorrow - renewable energies and rapid
Digitalization, state-of-the-art battery technology and green steel or the education of our children and liveable villages - we are building a Europe that offers protection: for its citizens, for you and for all of us.
We know that: All of this can only succeed on a European level. European
But sometimes it works.
The way there: attitude and responsibility
We want to take responsibility. That is why we ask for your trust. We stand for a policy that does not drown out, but convinces. For a policy with clear goals that also builds bridges to common solutions. For a policy that provides answers.
What gives us strength are the successes of the last legislative period. We have met the corona and energy crisis with European solidarity. European climate protection has moved in the direction of the Paris climate targets - thanks to the expansion of renewables and, for example, the phasing out of combustion engines. And large digital companies are now following democratic rules.
We want to make the European Union more democratic and closer precisely because we know that we can achieve more together than by going it alone at national level. We want Europe, absolutely
- but even better. Better for you. A Europe as it could be.
We are prepared to jump over our shadows if it means that we can make progress together.
Responsibility that is taken seriously always means compromise. There
We have our clear values behind us as strength and orientation; they are our guiding principles. One thing is clear: human rights apply without restriction and are non-negotiable. At the same time, European progress, especially in a Europe of diversity, has never been a supposedly pure doctrine, never for or against, never black or white. However, anyone who rejects compromise as such is concerned with being right, not with finding solutions; they accept that trust
democracy is eroding; it accepts that the unity of Europe will suffer.
Europe has experienced both: the darkest chapters of our history, but also the ability of people to open new chapters, fight for freedom and defend democracy. The European Union may be exhausting at times and yes, it needs to improve. But it remains the key to a life of prosperity and security. Today, when we are faced with several tasks of the century, all of them man-made, even if their simultaneity and magnitude may seem overwhelming at times, we as Europeans know that the answer will be the same: The answer will be the same - man-made and European.
What counts in all of this is not who wins or who is right. Success has no political color.
Success is what makes life better for people in Germany and Europe. What makes us stronger together. What holds our society together. What also protects you.
BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN are competing for the best ideas for such a policy. Such a policy is our offer to you.
We ask you for your trust in this path: Vote for Alliance 90/The Greens.
 What protects prosperity 
From small craft businesses to regionally anchored SMEs and large international companies: Europe's diverse and innovative economy is globally competitive - and Germany benefits from European integration and the single market like no other member state. Products and services from Thuringia or Hesse are traded between An- dalusia and Lapland, between Riga and Nicosia, as if these places were only a few kilometers apart. We are also the fourth strongest economy in the world because we join forces at European level.
Europe makes us strong. Strengthening Europe is therefore in our own best interests. We have already come a long way - with the Green Deal, we have set the right course across the EU. From 2050, Europe should no longer emit any greenhouse gases. Above all, it is now a matter of moving forward where the strength of the coming years and decades will come from, also and especially in order to bring the economy in line with planetary boundaries. We have a plan for this: the climate-neutral modernization of our economy and infrastructure. For us, this is not an end in itself, but also the key to competitiveness and prosperity, to quality of life, to good jobs and fair wages, to securing our natural resources - and thus to a stable basis for more social cohesion. security and social cohesion throughout the EU.
We are doing everything we can to ensure that Europe does not stand on the sidelines while China or the USA invest massively in the development of their location and future technologies. We accept the challenge: We want Germany and the EU to be at least on a par with their international partners in the markets of the future - in renewable energies
and hydrogen, in digital services and artificial intelligence (AI), in state-of-the-art batte-
technology and green steel. This makes Europe a pioneer for sustainable solutions and can define that new technologies are used for the benefit of people. This is a question of independence. Today, economic policy is also security policy. This also means that we protect critical infrastructure and strategically important industries from geostrategically motivated takeovers.
Europe's prosperity and quality of life are directly linked to its natural foundations - with fertile soils, near-natural forests and clean waters, with habitats for a wide variety of species, with intact nature on our coasts and in our landscapes. In their interplay, agriculture thrives in the immediate vicinity of high- tech companies, craft businesses are anchored in livable rural areas, and it is possible to travel from the cities to attractive cultural and natural landscapes for recreation in a short time.
Prosperity in Europe means fairly paid jobs, affordable housing and good public services in a functioning economy. It means justice and a fair social division of burdens and labor, not least between the sexes. But prosperity also means clean air, clean water and affordable, good food.
We are setting out to renew our prosperity by placing it on a climate-neutral foundation - one that will last for years and decades to come. We have put the European Green Deal on the agenda and it is the right strategy. We are continuing to fight for its continuation and full implementation. We are now ensuring thatithasan impact in all areas: from energy generation to mobility and agriculture to industrial policy. After all, climate protection and climate resilience are increasingly becoming decisive competitive factors.
and location factors. If we want to preserve our prosperity and create new ones, we Europeans must not only protect the climate, but also embrace this competition.
The prerequisite for this is an active European economic and industrial policy that enables innovation and builds sustainable infrastructure; that has the courage to make targeted strategic investments; that makes us independent of the autocracies of this world - and thus makes all our lives crisis-proof and affordable. We therefore want to expand renewable energies, the electricity grids and the hydrogen core network throughout Europe now - from solar energy from southern Spain to wind over the North Sea. We want to promote a modern and functioning rail network for climate-neutral travel from Florence to Flensburg and from Budapest to Barcelona and thus make our rail network truly pan-European. If we want to turn the European Union into a modern infrastructure union, then we will do so in order to secure production by industry and trade, electricity and heat, affordable energy and climate- friendly mobility for all - sustainably and in line with people's needs.
When we invest in research and development, we do so so that the best ideas continue to feel at home on our continent. When we reduce bureaucracy, we do so in order to put the EU at the service of Europeans, not paragraphs and authorities, without restricting quality standards. And when we use the potential of digitalization, we do so tomake data usable for the benefit of the people of Europe, not the other way around.
No country in Europe is up to these tasks alone. But together we are. Together in the EU, we are in a position to provide political answers that are effective and powerful enough to deal with global warming and systemic competition in equal measure.
This is the path we are taking. We want a fair and effective EU that creates security in the here and now - and at the same time sets the course for the future.
the prosperity and cohesion of tomorrow. We want an EU in which prosperity is created in harmony with nature and the climate. And we want an EU in which social or geographic origin, access to education, disability, gender or religious beliefs do not determine the chance of a good life. All people should be able to share in prosperity and contribute to it.
We are standing up for this Europe. This is the Europe we want to be.
1. A climate-neutral Europe
Investing in energy security
In order to achieve the climate targets, Europe needs a genuine energy union with an efficient and sustainable energy supply that utilizes and combines the potential and cost advantages of renewable energies across the entire continent.
We are massively expanding renewable energies throughout the EU as part of an active economic and industrial policy: By 2035, they should make a significant contribution to securing the EU's energy supply on the way to 100 percent climate neutrality. Because only renewables guarantee an independent and affordable energy supply in the long term, with which Europe can operate competitively in the long term. We want Germany to set a good example on this path.
To achieve this, we need an increase in energy efficiency and decarbonization intransport, industry and heat supply throughout Europe in the coming years, massive investments in the expansion of wind power, photovoltaic, solar and geothermal plants, energy storage systems of all kinds as well as waste heat recovery and heat pumps. In future, we want to work together even more closely on a European level in order to continuously develop the necessary requirements in unison.
In order to reliably transport electricity to where it is needed throughout the EU, we want to strengthen the European electricity grid as part of the Infrastructure Union and, above all, massively expand the connections between the member states. A decentralized, stable and interconnected European electricity grid makes us more resilient and increases our security of supply. The energy crisis showed this very clearly when the countries of Europe were at each other's mercy.
were able to do. We now want to make it fit for 100 percent renewable energies. This will enable us to exploit synergies in the EU, where the wind is always blowing or the sun is always shining somewhere. We are establishing integrated European grid planning - especially for c r o s s - b o r d e r projects and the expansion of wind energy in the EU's seas. In future, electricity grids, hydrogen grids, gas grids and heating grids must be considered together. We are gearing the electricity market design, grid fees and the regulation of energy storage systems of all kinds towards a system based on 100 percent renewable energies and the integration of the transport, heating and industrial sectors. The new electricity market design must allow electricity consumers to benefit from the cost advantages of renewable energies.
and at the same time secure the refinancing of
renewables. The price of renewable electricity should be decoupled from the rising costs of emissions trading. The decentralized nature of renewable energies allows many people and companies to generate their own electricity. The use of self-generated electricity should be encouraged through a favorable legal framework, as it not only brings them cost advantages, but also relieves the burden on the grids and thus the general public. Production peaks of renewable energies for which there is no use in the electricity grid should be able to be easily used on site, for example for electrolysis, in batteries or heat storage, in accordance with the principle of "use instead of shutting down".
Generations of people in the coalfields have made a valuable contribution to energy security, progress and our business location. We are building on this commitment and this expertise in the European energy
regions. However, coal is becoming increasingly unprofitable, is also the most harmful form of energy production in terms of climate and health and therefore has no future. We will create the conditions for ending coal-fired power generation in the EU. We will support the coal regions in their transition to new energies by 2030. We reject new obligations to pay compensation for the phase-out of fossil fuels. With new infrastructure, economic development, renaturation and innovation promotion, we are enabling the affected regions to make the transition to renewable energy.
regions are taking this path into the future. Companies, local authorities and a wide range of civic projects are crucial to the success of this comprehensive structural change. In this way, we ensure that the newly created prosperity reaches the local people and create reliable structures.
At the same time, the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine in particular has shown us how dependent we still are on natural gas and the difficulties this entails. In the coming years, in line with our climate targets, it will therefore be necessary to say goodbye to the development of new oil and gas fields once and for all.
We want to stop using fossil fuels to generate electricity in Germany by 2035 at the latest. In doing so, we are supporting the end of the extraction of CO2 sources in Europe and around the world. At the same time, we want to align our economic policy in Germany and Europe in such a way that fossil fuels are also phased out beyond this date.
production and combustion worldwide can be ended by 2050, in line with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. We can and will completely replace the fossil model with renewable energies combined with green hydrogen.
Nuclear power is not a sustainable form of energy generation and is not suitable for combating the climate crisis. It increases import dependencies, is considerably more expensive than renewables, involves high risks and is unreliable, especially in times of heat and drought. We advocate sanctions on uranium imports and Russia's nuclear business. Nuclear
Power plants are not least a threat to t h e safety of the population in war situations. Their construction is expensive and time-consuming. The danger of nuclear proliferation is ever-present, and the waste will burden countless generations to come. The shutdown of the last three nuclear power plants in Germany was therefore a key step towards a future-proof and affordable energy supply and a major success for the anti-nuclear movement. And it is for these reasons that we in the EU are campaigning against nuclear power as a viable form of energy generation. It is wrong to classify nuclear energy as sustainable and to support it with EU funds. We are striving for a comprehensive reform of the Euratom Treaty that makes the safety of decommissioning and nuclear waste disposal a central task and reflects the true costs and risks in the price.
We are excited about the future opportunities and potential of new energy technologies, which is why we want to drive forward the research and development of new ideas and, for example, continue to scientifically investigate storage technologies and nuclear power. Whether fusion or other approaches can make a contribution to energy supply in the future remains the subject of ongoing research, which always takes safety issues into account. Irrespective of this, the accelerated expansion of renewable energies must be implemented immediately and consistently, as it is a safe way forward
to solve the climate crisis - also for the urban agglomerations of the future.
Paving the way to a climate-neutral continent
Real progress has been made: to date, Europe has reduced emissions by around a third compared to 1990. With the "Fit for 55" plan, the EU aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030.
of their emissions compared to 1990. The free allocation of emission allowances to sectors that will fall under the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) in future will be phased out. This reformed emissions trading will make a faster European coal phase-out profitable. We have doubled the expansion targets for renewable
energies. And for fossil fuels
Energy, steel or chemical products imported into Europe will soon have to pay a price for their carbon footprint at the border.
The car industry is switching its production to electric vehicles. Buildings in the EU are being insulated and incentives are being provided for climate-friendly heating. Europe has thus taken the right path.
The EU must resolutely continue on this path to climate-neutral prosperity. Europe should become the first climate-neutral continent. There must be no backing away from this goal and it must be reliably achieved. It is a great success that the EU is moving towards the 1.5 degree pathway. We want an EU climate policy that leads to climate neutrality with clear interim targets based on the scientific recommendations of the EU Climate Council. At the same time, we also want to shape European climate policy in the future in such a way that social cohesion is not jeopardized. We also want to make the interim target for 2035 binding at the United Nations (UN), as all countries have pledged internationally as part of the Paris Climate Agreement. Among other things, the framework for climate protection measures and the European emissions trading systems must be adapted for implementation. The agriculture and fisheries sector must also make its contribution to reducing emissions. In addition to pricing greenhouse gases, the instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) must also be consistently geared towards climate protection.
With the inclusion of methane in emissions trading
and the new methane regulation, the EU has taken important steps to reduce this climate-damaging gas in line with its high warming potential, particularly in the short term. What is needed now is a rapid introduction of requirements for detecting and closing methane leaks in the upstream chain and a threshold for imports of coal, oil and gas into the EU.
Using natural CO2 sinks and technological progress
In order to achieve the climate targets, we need to get out of coal, oil and gas quickly and into renewable energies.
and green hydrogen. In a few sectors, however, there will still be emissions in the future that cannot be avoided using current technology, such as in the cement industry. In these areas, we want to take advantage of technological opportunities and capture the CO2 directly during production, store it in a safe and stable form and, if necessary, use it in closed carbon cycles (Carbon Capture Use
/ Storage, CCU / CCS). Where technically unavoidable emissions occur, this can be actively promoted. In principle, the polluter pays principle applies to funding. We reject the active promotion of CCS for the production of blue hydrogen in Germany. The energy transition and Decarbonization in industry is our priority. This focus will also be reflected in funding. We want to create a uniform Europe-wide regulatory framework for this, including a binding liability law, and develop an integrated European infrastructure
- including joint European CO2 storage facilities. We take into account existing uses, especially at sea, binding ecological criteria and the exclusion of protected areas.
According to analyses by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it will become increasingly difficult to achieve the 1.5-degree pathway in the future. The predicted possibilities of achieving this path require an active reduction in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It is therefore essential to actively reduce them in order to return to a stable and sustainable level. To achieve this, we are researching and developing negative emissions - natural and technical processes thatremove CO2 from the atmosphere in the medium term. Intact ecosystems are our best allies, because
Forests, floodplains, peatlands and oceans in particular are natural CO2 reservoirs. Protecting and restoring such natural CO2 sinks is a priority for us. In addition to the climate, they also have a positive influence on water cycles and the weather. That is why we need
We need smart regulation and increased support for natural climate protection, agriculture, humus formation, the rewetting of
The restoration of peatlands, the renaturation of floodplains and seagrass beds, the sustainable use of wood and the restoration of near-natural, species-rich and structurally rich forests that promote both ecologically and economically sustainable management in the future. To this end, Europe needs a comprehensive "Natural Climate Protection" package to implement the Nature Restoration Law, which also lays the legal foundations for the swift designation of priority areas for forest restoration.
renaturation and natural climate protection. Reducing livestock farming in Europe will also free up more land for the restoration of nature. At the same time, we want to examine the potential of technical negative emissions such as bioenergy with CO2 storage in application and evaluate them in pilot projects. As with other technologies, the principles of precaution and technology assessment apply. The EU needs clear targets for achieving negative emissions without trading them against emission reduction targets.
Using green hydrogen as the energy source of the future
Green hydrogen, i.e. hydrogen from renewable energies, can store energy and make it transportable. It is an important component of our future energy supply, as it can replace fossil fuels in many cases where electrification is not an option. The production of green hydrogen in times of surplus wind and solar power also has a stabilizing effect on the integration of renewable energies into our electricity grid. We want to ensure that Europe becomes a pioneer in the hydrogen economy. In order to reduce the currently quite high costs and efficiency losses in hydrogen production and transportation, we will continue to support research and development in this area of technology. With instruments such as climate protection contracts and a comprehensive investment program, we are ensuring a rapid ramp-up of production of this key technology.
We want to increase investment in a new trans- European hydrogen core network in order to
to transport green hydrogen from the sunny and windy regions of Europe to European industrial centers by converting the existing gas infrastructure and building new pipelines such as H2Med. In order to minimize grid expansion costs and enable regional hydrogen production and use as early as possible, we are accelerating the development of a decentralized hydrogen infrastructure at the same time. We are dovetailing this with the expansion of the electricity grids and a cross-sector European storage strategy that also incorporates the process and waste heat potential of industry. This is part of an efficient infrastructure union.
We are also committed to building a global market for green hydrogen and strategic partnerships for its global trade. Thanks to a large number of potential partner countries, which we also evaluate in terms of democracy and human rights, we can ensure a diversified energy supply and avoid one-sided dependencies. Through fair partnerships at eye level, the sharing of know- how, better access to renewable energies and the protection of local water supplies, we enable the countries of the Global South to integrate themselves into the value chain and benefit from the green energy future. We are committed to high standards for the certification of green hydrogen at European level. We want to avoid importing hydrogen that has not been synthesized using renewable energy wherever possible.
As production capacities first have to be built up, hydrogen will remain a very scarce raw material for the time being. To reduce CO2 emissions, we are therefore focusing primarily on energy efficiency and the electrification of drives, production processes and heating systems, as this is the most efficient way to use green electricity. We therefore want to prioritize the use of hydrogen in areas where electrification is not possible or only possible with great difficulty. This includes the production of basic materials such as steel, glass, paper or chemical products, heavy goods transportation and the transport of goods.
intercontinental sea and air transportation. In the future, we will also use green hydrogen to generate electricity when solar and wind power generation is low and loads are particularly high, if this is economically necessary or to ensure security of supply with renewable energies at all times.
Achieving climate neutrality in a social and citizen-oriented way
Climate neutrality secures and increases prosperity, but is also associated with change. This process demands a lot from all of us. This is not the only reason why climate neutrality must always mean social and gender equality. That is why we want to introduce a climate money as soon as possible. We will evaluate how this can be made socially just in the long term. The climate money will relieve the burden on people with low and middle incomes in particular, who produce less CO2 anyway. With the Social Climate Fund, which is primarily fed from emissions trading, we are giving the member states the means to implement this. It finances benefits for people who are particularly affected by rising energy prices.
and transportation costs are affected. The new European emissions trading scheme for buildings and heating will generate additional revenue. We therefore want the Member States to use these revenues to pay out a per capita climate bonus - as is already the case in Austria with the climate bonus. We will evaluate how this can be designed to be socially fair in the long term.
Renewable energies are citizen energies. They enable people and communities to take their energy supply into their own hands. This shows solidarity and is democratic, as it means that the revenues remain local. The German government has made it much easier for people to use renewable energy themselves. This should apply throughout Europe: The use of community energy is to become even more financially attractive and easier. We want to make it easier for citizens to participate in the energy transition at a European level - by becoming members of a community wind farm, selling the electricity from their photovoltaic system directly to their neighbors or using the electricity generated in their cars to power their homes.
and buffer batteries simply to stabilize the grid.
Renewable energies guarantee that people will still be able to heat their homes affordably in the future. We therefore support the further development of European requirements for the efficiency of buildings and heating systems in order to quickly and cost-effectively free buildings in poor energy condition in particular from their
d e p e n d e n c e on fossil fuels and ensure their long-term affordability. High energy standards for new buildings are another important building block here. When renovating existing buildings, we want to reduce housing costs through targeted investments. In doing so, we are focusing primarily on providing advice as well as socially structured and sufficiently large financial incentives.
We want all Member States to develop municipal heating plans or integrated energy infrastructure plans that show what potential there is for renewables and how waste heat, for example, can be used in an energy-efficient way.
To safeguard the right to clean air, we also advocate strict emissions protection
all systems that use combustion processes. Wood is a valuable natural material that should be used in houses and furniture, also as a CO2 storage medium. As part of cascading use, energy use should be limited to residual and waste wood.
With an efficient and fair electricity market design, transparent infrastructure costs that are as low as possible, greater flexibility on the consumer side and intelligent load management, the benefits of low-cost renewable electricity generation will reach consumers. As a first step, we are protecting the energy market by converting the promotion of renewable energies to two-sided differential tariffs.
contracts with upper and lower limits for electricity generation revenues protect electricity consumers from high costs. The price of renewable electricity should be decoupled from the rising costs of emissions trading. With clear European regulation of energy storage systems of all kinds, we want to drive forward their market i n t e g r a t i o n and provide the urgently needed
Leverage flexibilization potential. In the long term, an electricity market design is needed that ensures the refinancing of renewable energies and at the same time ensuresthat consumers benefit from the cost advantages of cheap wind and solar power.
2. A competitive business location
Investing in innovation, sovereignty and resilience
To make the infrastructure union a reality, we are opting for a strategic European investment policy. The NextGenerationEU (NGEU) recovery program has saved us from a severe crisis during the pandemic and has played a major role in holding the EU together economically and politically. With the end of NGEU in 2026, this important pillar of European investment financing is in danger of breaking a w a y . NGEU can serve as a model for effective joint European financing of major investment projects - such as the development of the infrastructure union.
We therefore want to create a major investment program for innovation, sovereignty and resilience from 2028 with three clear goals: Firstly, we want Europe to continue to grow together through strong common infrastructures as part of the Infrastructure Union - with a fully developed, integrated European rail, electricity and hydrogen network that is adapted to the worsening climate crisis. Secondly, we want to promote the climate- neutral conversion of industry throughout Europe as well as the development of the industries of tomorrow. And thirdly, we want to make our economy and our societies more resilient to and less dependent on autocracies.
Actively shaping industrial policy
Europe is a strong business location with a diverse landscape of small, medium-sized and large companies.
large companies, which is an essential foundation for our prosperity. We will ensure that this remains the case. Two levers are central to this:
Firstly, we are strengthening the internal market,
i.e. the EU's common regulatory framework for companies. This common framework, in which no member state may give its own companies unfair advantages and whose rules set the gold standard in many areas around the world, makes an invaluable contribution to our prosperity, especially for Germany as an exporting country. We will continue to deepen it and defend its foundations.
On the other hand, we have to realize that China in particular, but also the USA with its Inflation Reduction Act, are investing massively in the development of new production sites for key and future technologies. We accept this competition: The EU must counter this with its own active economic and industrial policy that builds on Europe's strengths to reclaim, develop and scale key and future industries. It starts with research and ranges from the training and further education of skilled workers to support for investments. This includes a supply policy that reduces bureaucracy and provides incentives for private investment on the one hand, and strong public funding programs for future technologies such as electrolysers, solar plants, wind turbines, energy storage systems, e- cars and microchips on the other. We want the EU to be at the forefront of the markets of the future and for the products of the future to be conceived and manufactured in the EU. The aim and mission of our industrial policy is to secure jobs and prosperity in Europe by strengthening Europe as a business location and renewing it in a climate- neutral way. The development of a European semiconductor industry is fundamental to the renewal of Europe as an industrial location and serves our economic capacity to act and independence.
We will push for a new start here: A funding jungle has developed in the EU that makes it very difficult for companies to access the available funds quickly and unbureaucratically.
to come. This is a decisive competitive disadvantage - compared to the USA, for example. We advocate a coherent and easy-to-understand industrial policy in which subsidy policy and state aid law also go hand in hand. To this end, we want to transfer relevant parts of the current national industrial policies to the European level, which will be much better funded and put in a position to act quickly and effectively. In addition, we need to mobilize private capital for the climate-neutral renewal of industry. Scaling up the renewable energy industry requires clear targets, strategic management of value chains and a coordinated European structural policy.
Equipping our economy for global competition
European industry can only be competitive in the long term and the EU can only meet its climate targets if industrial production processes become completely climate-neutral. To achieve this, we will renew the industrial base and focus on new value creation opportunities.
More and more companies are investing massively in converting their production. Politicians must create the framework for this: a clear reduction path in European emissions trading. We are bringing it to life by massively expanding renewable energies and the infrastructure for electricity and green hydrogen so that enough green energy is available everywhere at competitive prices.
is available in Europe. Until this is the case to a sufficient extent, we want to ensure, in particular with suitable measures linked to the use of renewable electricity, that energy-intensive companies can also continue to produce in the EU and make the transition to climate neutrality.
This is one of the reasons why we want to support companies with a European programme to decarbonize industry. To this end, we want to finance the EU-wide use of climate protection contracts (carbon contracts for difference) from the EU budget and thus
financially support those companies that convert their production to climate-neutral as quickly and cost-effectively as possible and save the most CO2 in the process. We want to focus on all industrial sectors.
In addition, we want to create European green lead markets for some particularly energy- intensive products from climate-neutral production, such as green steel. To this end, we want to stipulate a minimum quota of green steel for public contracts, for example, which will steadily increase. This will create a new sales market that will trigger climate-neutral production via a market mechanism. We also want to enable industry to make its electricity consumption more flexible and set appropriate incentives so that it can already benefit from the price advantages of renewable energies and reduce grid infrastructure costs. Finally, we also want to significantly accelerate planning and approval procedures for the conversion of production processes to climate- neutral processes, as this contributes to a faster reduction in emissions while at the same time maintaining industrial subs- tance and good jobs.
With the staggered introduction of resilience and sustainability criteria in public tenders and public funding programs, we want to specifically promote the production of these products in the EU. In the long term, we want to orient our economy more towards the common good.
Strengthening the internal market
The EU internal market is central to the prosperity of the EU population and helps to counteract distortions of competition. It is also a key lever for advancing the climate-neutral modernization of our economy. It enables European companies to offer goods and services anywhere in the EU. And it enables employees to work anywhere in the EU. That is why we want to strengthen and deepen the internal market: Where there is one common rule in the EU, companies no longer have to follow 27 different ones.
We are shaping the rules for the single market in such a way that it helps to achieve overarching goals: Democracy, prosperity, social justice, environmental and climate protection and the creation o f	fairly paid jobs. We also want to use the internal market to become more resilient to crises and less dependent on imports of raw materials.
In order to ensure functioning competition for the benefit of consumers and small businesses
we have tightened up competition law in Germany. EU competition law also needs such an update. To this end, we want to revive the New Competition Tool, which the Commission has already proposed.
A strong competition policy that combats the formation ofexcessive market power and prevents subsidy races within the EU as far as possible is what makes the single market a success. We want to maintain this in the future. However, in the struggle for the markets of the future, the EU is now in global competition with other countries that do not adhere to these rules. The EU Commission must therefore create a permanent new state aid framework, particularly for the green technologies of the future, which will enable the member states to pursue a more active, European- coordinated industrial policy and at the same time prevent distortions of competition. This includes faster planning security for state aid procedures as well as exemptions for the support of new production facilities in future technologies and for the conversion of production processes to climate neutrality and the circular economy.
One approach to this is the IPCEI strategic funding projects, with which the EU aims to enable and coordinate the industrial policy of the member states in key sectors such as the development of the European hydrogen infrastructure and the value chains around microelectronics. To ensure greater planning security for companies, the state aid procedures must be accelerated, especially in the context of the IPCEIs.
Train, attract and retain skilled workers
A stable European economy secures our prosperity. With good working conditions, secure jobs, decent wages and further training, we can attract and retain the necessary workers and specialists. This applies equally
for academically trained specialists as well as for those with training in the skilled trades, industry or the public sector. We want everyone to be able to contribute to prosperity - and for it to benefit all those who create it. This is how we grow from the middle. The success of the energy transition also depends on this. This also means that by investing in climate protection, we are simultaneously promoting secure and future-proof jobs.
To achieve this, we need to train young people accordingly, provide further training opportunities for everyone - especially for older workers - and attract skilled workers from outside the country. Refugees who come to us should also be allowed to work and have quick access to language courses. At the same time, we must give women the opportunity to play a full part. In many EU countries, millions of women often work part-time involuntarily or not at all. At EU level, we need a feminist economic, labor market and time policy that takes into account the social infrastructure for reconciling family, work and democratic participation.
We want to make it easier for women to choose a technical - and therefore often well-paid - profession. We want to introduce a bonus that companies and businesses from sectors inwhicha below-average number of women have been employed to date can receive in the allocation of EU funding if they train or employ an above- average number of women. Together with the trade unions and companies, we will develop new ideas on how we can enable equal participation and pay for the sexes in the economy. At the same time, we want to improve the pay, working conditions and recognition of predominantly female occupational fields in a targeted manner.
With their diverse skills, people with disabilities offer great potential as skilled workers. We want to bring about a cultural change towards an inclusive labor market policy and also focus EU funding programs more strongly on this. We want to consistently enforce the legal regulations on the employment and training of people with disabilities and on barrier-free workplaces.
Europe is competing with other regions of the world for skilled workers. From civil engineers and tradespeople to nurses in hospitals. We therefore advocate a comprehensive EU strategy for skilled workers. When recruiting from third countries, the EU Blue Card initiative should be extended to non- academic professions, provided there is a concrete job offer at standard market conditions. At the same time, the recruitment and migration of skilled workers can also lead to serious challenges for the regions of origin. Our aim is therefore for the EU to invest more in the partnership-based training of skilled workers - to the benefit of the labor market in the country of origin as well as in Europe.
Many employees who work in the fossil fuel industry are worried about their livelihoods if their industries are electrified. We therefore want to combine the transition to a climate-neutral economy with well-paid jobs, attractive training and further education opportunities, collective wage agreements and economic and social security, especially in regions that are still structurally weak. Our industrial policy offers a lever for this: we want to link the allocation of EU funds more closely to the fact that training places are available in the region.
social standards are observed and applicable tariffs are adhered to.
3. Stable finances
Arming Europe financially
A key factor in the EU's ability to act is its financial resources: whatever we undertake together in the EU must also be financed to a relevant extent with European funds.
be able to finance them from our own resources. We want to finally meet this requirement, as far- reaching decisions will have to be made over the next five years regarding the financing of our joint European projects well into the 2030s.
We will be guided by two principles: Firstly, we want to improve the financial resources of the EU as a whole through new own resources and higher national contributions. Joint European bonds have also proven their worth in tackling major challenges. Secondly, the EU must be given significantly more room for maneuver in the use of its funds in order to use them for joint investments in strategically important areas such as industrial policy and for an infrastructure union. With this in mind, we will fight for a strong Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the basis for the EU budget, as well as for a new major investment program.
We want the MFF for the years 2028 to 2035 to grow significantly compared to the current one. Germany must also make its contribution to this. We need to specifically strengthen the expenditure items that improve the EU's ability to act in the crucial areas of the future. To this end, we must also critically review the impact of expenditure in the MFF. This applies in particular to the areas in which the Member States manage expenditure.
The protection of our common good requires an EU that is also financially capable of acting.
Especially in times of massively growing tasks, it cannot finance itself in the long term solely from the contributions of the member states. It also needs its own revenues to secure its financial resources in the long term. To this end, we want to enshrine the principle that the majority of revenue generated by European instruments should in principle come from the EU.
benefit the EU budget. In a first implementation step, we want to stipulate that 75% of the potential money creation profits of the Eurosystem will benefit the EU budget in future. 75% of the income from the new CO2 border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) should also go to the EU budget.
To ensure that the upcoming interest and redemption payments for the NGEU program do not lead to a reduction in the EU budget, we want to implement the roadmap for new own resources adopted by the Council and Parliament in 2020 as quickly as possible. In doing so, the financing of the necessary national climate financing in the Member States must be ensured.
Completing economic and monetary union
A stable and cohesive economic and monetary union is a basic prerequisite for prosperity and political and social cohesion in Europe. However, the architecture of the monetary union is still incomplete and Europe therefore remains vulnerable to crises. We want to change this with a comprehensive package of measures.
With the new investment program for innovation, sovereignty and resilience, we are consolidating the common fiscal policy - also as an important buffer in times of crisis. By transferring the European Stability Mechanism to the EU legal framework and switching to majority decisions, we are abolishing national vetoes in crises and finally establishing joint European parliamentary control over future EU aid programs.
By introducing unemployment reinsurance along the lines of the EU short-time work allowance (SURE), we are creating an additional safety net in times of crisis so that the member states can protect jobs. We want to complete the banking and capital markets union to transform the EU from a monetary union into a genuine economic union. By removing structural barriers to cross- border capital flows, we are improving the financing conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), releasing potential for investment and making our financial system more robust at the same time.
A resilient monetary union also needs functioning rules for the budgetary policies of the member states, which ensure that the debt burden is not too high.
ensure viability in all countries at all times and at the same time create enough room for investment and growth. The rules that have been in place for a decade are too restrictive and have prevented necessary investments in many EU member states, while at the same time they were no longer sensible and comprehensible for the European Commission to apply. That is why we are fighting for an ambitious reform that creates more transparency and more scope for investment and whose results are consistently enforced by the Commission.
A crisis-proof monetary union also requires that all member states within the community have the most balanced current account balances possible in order to avoid dangerous imbalances that can arise from undercutting competition in wages, taxes and social security systems, for example. The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) should play an even stronger role in promoting the
climate-neutral renewal of the economy through a politically sharpened mandate.
We support the introduction of the digital euro as a supplement to the book money of commercial banks and to cash, which will remain possible as a barrier-free means of payment.
The digital euro promotes the digitalization of the economy and gives consumers digital access to secure and stable value.
Central bank money. As a public good, it can make a valuable contribution to financial inclusion, the sovereignty of the EU and the stability of our payment system in the digital age.
Shaping financial markets responsibly
Our economy and society depend on functioning financial markets. We want to strengthen the responsibility of all financial market players - for corporate investments, for employees and for the common good. We want to use strong financial market regulation to protect basic needs such as housing and health from speculation. In order to prevent speculation and the focus on short-term goals
the financial markets, we want to create a Introduce a financial transaction tax.
In order to support the climate-neutral renewal of our economy, the financial system must become more resilient and be consistently aligned with the European sustainability goals. This requires clear rules against greenwashing. Every financing decision is a decision about the economy of the future and must therefore also be compatible with our commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.
The banking sector in the EU is central to financing the investments of companies and citizens in the modernization of our economy. For this reason alone, we cannot afford another banking crisis.
With a significantly higher unweighted capital ratio of at least 10 percent, regular stress tests and the completion of the banking union, we are putting the banks on a stable footing. The interdependence of states and banks should be reduced. This is why we are working at EU level to further reduce concentration risks in bank balance sheets, including through government bonds.
With a European deposit reinsurance scheme that allows the institutional protection schemes of savings banks and cooperative banks to be maintained, a functioning resolution regime andthe separation of lending business with private customers from investment banking at major banks, we can prevent credit institutions from
have to be bailed out with taxpayers' money in the event of insolvency. By obliging banks to gradually reduce the emissions they finance, we ensure that their business is in line with the goal of climate neutrality.
In addition to banks, all other players in the financial sector such as rating agencies, insurers and pension funds must also disclose and take into account climate and biodiversity risks. We advocate greater coherence in European legislation in order to prevent unnecessary bureaucracy - especially for smaller companies.
The EU's green taxonomy is a means of supporting the financing of environmentally friendly economic activities. Therefore, it remains wrong to classify nuclear energy and natural gas as sustainable.
However, sustainability is more complex than a binary yes or no, because we also need strong and innovative suppliers, for example for e-cars or wind turbines, which have not yet been included in the taxonomy. We want to better reflect this in the future. We want to add further gradations to the green taxonomy so that investments in the transition to a sustainable economy are adequately financed. In addition, we want to actively support the EU Commission's proposals for the design of social instruments, such as a social taxonomy, in order to channel investments more strongly into social sectors.
Green investments have become mainstream, as many people want to participate in future- oriented industries and protect the climate at the same time. However, financial supervision has not kept pace with the rapid growth of sustainable financial products. In order to strengthen investor confidence, we therefore want to equip the European financial supervisory authorities with far-reaching powers against greenwash- ing and introduce a state labeling system for sustainable investments. Consumers should have clarity about how a financial product contributes to the climate-neutral modernization of our economy.
We want to make the Capital Markets Union a success. To achieve this, we need to win back the trust of savers. Conflicts of interest due to commissions have meant that savers have far too often been sold expensive, risky or unsuitable financial products. We want commissions to no longer play a role in financial advice in the medium term and for everyone to have access to independent, commission-free advice. This is the only way we can make the potential of the Capital Markets Union accessible to everyone. We want to put an end to misleading formulations, inadequate labels and non-transparent ways in which financial products work.
4. 
Tax justice
Combating tax evasion
The financing of our democratic system depends oneveryone making a fair contribution - for schools and childcare, for hospitals, for a good bus and rail infrastructure. In recent years, courageous whistleblowers and independent media have uncovered a whole series of international tax scandals. They have shown how the super-rich and many large companies use tax tricks to shift profits to low-tax countries: from tax loopholes, letterbox companies and tax havens to tax fraud. These practices shift the tax burden onto citizens, especially SMEs, who rightfully pay their taxes. It is estimated that tax abuse causes losses of more than 170 billion euros annually across the EU. Tax fraud and tax evasion are often cross-border problems. The EU can make an effective contribution to combating this.
We also want to make further progress in the fight against tax avoidance, for example by shifting profits to tax havens. Stricter criteria are needed to ensure that the EU list of tax havens is truly complete. For example, well-known tax havens such as Singapore are currently missing. Countries with a tax rate of zero percent must automatically end up on the EU list of tax havens, such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. Decisions on which country is placed on the list must be made transparently, according to uniform criteria and impartially.
We also want to significantly improve cross-border cooperation between tax authorities in order to strengthen the EU-wide exchange of tax-relevant information. We welcome the fact that cryptoassets are now also to be fully covered.
We will tackle the abuse of letterbox companies,
i.e. companies that only exist to evade or shift taxes. We call on the member states to adopt the EU Commission's proposal quickly and without watering it down - the EU would be a global pioneer with this legislation. We also want to use AI to detect tax fraud and identify loopholes on a non-discriminatory basis.
Withholding taxes reduce the risk of tax evasion and avoidance, as demonstrated by the cum-ex and cum-cum scandals, as well as the shifting of profits to low-tax countries. We therefore support the EU Commission's plans to introduce an EU- wide system for withholding tax on dividends and interest payments and advocate a further step - an EU-wide minimum withholding tax rate.
Internationally, we must tackle the problem of withholding tax on foreign payments in third countries outside the EU.
End tax dumping
The patchwork of national tax regulations and tax competition between EU member states in terms of corporate tax rates make it difficult to achieve a level playing field in the single market. To counteract this, tax legislation must keep pace with new business models that have become more international, complex and digital. For example, large digital companies with their intangible assets (such as data, knowledge or algorithms) benefit from the fact that corporate profits are taxed at the location of a physical branch or factory and not, for example, where the users of digital services are located. We want to prevent the bakery store around the corner from paying a significantly higher tax rate than
a major international corporation. All companies must contribute their fair share to financing the common good.
A major step has been taken towards fair and effective corporate taxation in Europe: The EU has
- as a result
The two countries have finally agreed on a minimum tax rate of 15 percent for large multinational companies following a breakthrough at the level of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This means that they can no longer escape a minimum standard of taxation.
draw. Implementation in the member states and the European Commission's proposal for a new EU framework for corporate taxation (BEFIT) must now follow. The agreement on minimum taxation is a key step in the reform of the international tax system. However, it is still not enough to ensure that large digital companies, e-commerce or multinational companies in Europe are taxed more fairly. If no progress is foreseeable in the currently faltering negotiations at OECD level in this area, the EU Commission should propose how this goal can be pursued at European level.
Tax transparency is an effective instrument as it makes tax dumping visible to all. The agreement on public country-by-country tax reporting by large companies
in 2021 was a milestone in this sense. When large companies disclose how much tax they pay in the individual EU member states, they
This leads to better control of their tax practices. But not all countries are covered yet. We will work towards using the review clause in the law to improve the directive and achieve a global breakdown of relevant tax data. To prevent destructive tax competition between EU member states, there also needs to be a clear EU framework for tax concessions that individual member states can grant to companies.
We are committed to addressing the market- dominating position of the large auditing firms. This requires a clear separation between auditing and tax consulting, more joint audits and a sustainable reduction in the financial links between auditors and the companies to be audited.
Financing the community in solidarity
Tax justice means that high levels of wealth and billions in corporate profits must make a fair contribution in order to finance the community in a spirit of solidarity, promote climate protection and sustainability and reduce social inequality. The high level of inequality and concentration of wealth in particular has continued to increase throughout the EU.
In order to address these problems, the EU must also be able to act in the area of tax policy. We support the member states in the introduction and implementation of suitable measures to reduce wealth inequality. Efforts to combat tax dumping and tax evasion are repeatedly prevented by vetoes from individual EU member states. We want to exploit the existing possibilities of the treaties to take qualified majority decisions. In the future, overcoming the unanimity principle will open up greater scope for joint action.
As a result of the Russian war in Ukraine, oil and gas companies made extremely high windfall profits from high energy prices. These disproportionate profits made by some of the winners of the crisis are offset by record levels of poverty, which have been exacerbated by a sharp rise in the cost of living. The fact that the EU has agreed on an excess profits tax in this situation, through which the large energy companies return a crisis contribution to society, is a great success.
Part of the current inflation was caused by excessive profits and
is not justified by increased production costs. We call for the instrument of a progressive excess profits tax to be firmly anchored for other areas as well in order to relieve the burden on public budgets in special economic situations. Loopholes such as the small calculation of profits over several financial years or the shifting of profits abroad must be closed.
5. 
Innovative strength and reducing bureaucracy
Anchoring European research at the top of the world
For the great technological, social and economic challenges of our time, we need the combined knowledge of our entire continent and beyond. That is why a European science and research policy that connects people and institutions from all over Europe and supports them in the development of free science is a key element for a future of freedom and prosperity. We want the next major breakthroughs in the areas of climate-friendly mobility, information technology
or the treatment of diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome ME / CFS, cancer or Alzheimer's are conceived and produced in Europe.
Expenditure on research and development must therefore increase significantly in Europe as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP).
At the heart of this is the Horizon Europe program, which bundles the EU's research activities. It is a highly successful funding program that is very popular with applicants and is unparalleled worldwide. We want to expand its scope in the next European financial framework.
European research policy must include free basic research as well as mission- and application- oriented research and transfer. Central to this is climate research, for which we were able to establish a fixed quota of 35 percent for European climate research in the current Horizon Europe cycle.
In future, we also want to establish much stronger funding for biodiversity research. We advocate well- funded basic research - for example in the European Research Council, the excellence research par excellence.
We want to consolidate the Marie Sklodowska Curie mobility funding, which is so important for researchers.
We will continue to campaign for the social sciences and humanities to be given a permanent place in the EU funding framework and for critical sciences to be taken into account, as they are of great importance for a vibrant and resilient culture, society and democracy. By creating a better understanding of social contexts and necessities, they help to overcome multiple crises with holistic solutions. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, teaches us that peace research and research on the countries of Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia must be intensified. We want to promote cooperation between European and Ukrainian universities. We want to continue to strengthen Open Access, i.e. the principle that research results and research data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, as a principle of Horizon Europe and support it in international cooperation.
Horizon Europe is already connected to many partner countries worldwide, which promotes the exchange of knowledge. However, we want to make Horizon Europe more accessible and more international for our researchers. To this end, we want to simplify the application process, reduce bureaucracy and involve more partner countries. In scientific cooperation with non-European partners, it is important to protect European technological sovereignty and guarantee scientific freedom.
Good policy is based on verifiable facts and scientific findings. We advocate standards and transparency guidelines when commissioning scientific studies and expert opinions.
Turning ideas into wealth
Innovation is crucial for Europe's economic future. We want to support ideas on their way from the laboratory to practice. Innovations are a decisive building block for the economic success of tomorrow.
Building on basic research, we are shaping mission- oriented research that helps us to tackle the major challenges of our time and understand their causes: For example, we need a faster roll-out of renewable energy, effective treatments for cancer, smart digital solutions and approaches to tackle social inequality. The missions of Horizon Europe should continue to be guided in particular by the Green Deal. To implement them, we want to bring together universities, institutes, civil society and business.
Innovation policy is an important part of our active economic and industrial policy. We want to expand the transfer-oriented program components of Horizon Europe so that the best ideas are supported on the way to their implementation. In order to make participation in funding programmes more attractive for SMEs, municipal institutions and non- governmental organizations (NGOs), the application and documentation of projects should be simplified as much as possible.
To this end, the EU should also increasingly support regional innovation ecosystems in which science, society, business and the public sector work together on the necessary solutions for the future. Such clusters of research, teaching and practice are key to promoting innovation, accelerating its application and creating climate- neutral prosperity locally. In addition to universities, universities of applied sciences and universities of applied sciences should also be considered. To date, they have often not benefited from EU funding to the same extent as universities, but are particularly strong in applied research. In order to improve this, we want to look at the application and funding conditions of the relevant programs.
We want to make the existing instruments more manageable and faster. This applies, for example, to the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which are particularly dedicated to training young talent, for example in master's or further education programs. By strengthening the
knowledge triangle of higher education, research and innovation, we can give as many people as possible the chance to get involved in key issues of the future.
Transparency and traceability of decisions are also of great importance in this relevant area: the Commission has created a large number of public- private partnerships that manage EU funds together with industry. We would like to launch a transparency initiative here, review existing partnerships and ensure that universities, research institutes and start-ups benefit more from these funding instruments. In addition to proven research formats, long-term studies are also an important contribution to balanced research.
Space is crucial for Europe's technological and strategic sovereignty. Europe must therefore play a leading role in space and needs independent and reliable access to space. We are strengthening the competitiveness of the space industry under the principle of "New Space", for example by promoting new technologies and a European launcher competition. We promote the EU space program, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the astronaut program.
With a European Space Act, we are leading the way internationally, ensuring sustainability and creating growth opportunities and legal certainty for European companies.
Taking off with European start-ups
An innovative corporate landscape needs a lively start-up scene. This is where the start-ups and business models of tomorrow are born. To achieve this, founding must become easier and faster. We want to ensure that there are one-stop stores in every member state. There, founders can find support and advice from a single source. A digital compass should provide an overview of all funding programs for start-ups. Our goal is to make it easy to apply with just one click.
We need a clear responsibility for young companies in the Commission so that the transfer of know-how in the EU is better coordinated. With a European start-up strategy, we are bundling important measures to improve access to venture capital, to attract talent and to public contracts for young companies. The potential of underrepresented groups, especially women and people with a history of migration, should also be better utilized and supported sothattheir ideas have a fair chance of being implemented.
The European Tech Champions Initiative, which the German government has launched together with other EU member states, is an important building block to better support start-ups in the growth phase. In addition, we want to create regular European matching hubs that bring private investors together with founders, a trade fair for business models of the future. Good innovation support also consists of implementing and sustainably securing good and reliable working conditions in science and business.
We want to expand and make greater use of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to strengthen innovative start-ups and climate- friendly industry, especially in cross-border regions.
Promoting SMEs and skilled trades
The innovative capacity and drive of SMEs and the skilled crafts sector are the driving force behind the European economy. Particularly in rural areas, the skilled trades and SMEs provide jobs and stability. They develop, produce, install and maintain future technologies such as solar systems and heat pumps. Europe thrives on cooperation and local problem solvers. However, SMEs, from industry to the skilled trades, are particularly burdened by the introduction of new regulations and bureaucratic hurdles in funding programs. We will therefore improve and consistently apply the SME tests, which assess the impact of new laws on SMEs in line with the "Think
small first" principle should always be reviewed in advance and adjustments made accordingly. We also advocate appropriate exemptions and transition periods for SMEs in new laws and provide support during the changeover. We particularly promote training in the skilled trades. By simplifying application procedures and reducing reporting requirements, we are making it easier for SMEs to access EU funding and investment programs. With the help of fixed SME quotas, we ensure that they actually benefit from these programs. We will standardize the funding landscape in the EU and dovetail it more closely with national funding instruments.
Some legal regulations are now outdated, while others are unsuitable in practice. We advocate a regular review of all regulations in order to simplify bureaucratic requirements and remove regulations that fail to achieve their objective. Where possible and equally effective, we prefer graduated and flexible regulation for companies instead of hard regulation. For example, we want to replace the reporting requirement for overnight stays in tourism and A1 certificates with a more practical approach with pragmatic solutions for small businesses.
A central means of reducing bureaucracy is the digitalization of administration. This can eliminate many administrative procedures, automate data exchange and make it easier to submit applications.
Administrative services should be digitally as far as possible. The status of
procedures should be accessible online. Through stronger networking between European and national authorities, the once-only principle is to be introduced so that in future data will only be requested once from companies so that it can then be exchanged within the framework of data protection regulations and within the authorities. We want to largely abolish the written form requirement in administrative procedures.
6. 
Digital sovereignty
Making Europe digitally fit
Digitalization provides a key to the central challenges of our time. It makes it possible to completely rethink fundamental areas of life such as transportation, education, health and energy. As a result, it offers enormous opportunities for economic development and for simplifying many tasks for everyone - from tedious administrative processes and the management of supply chains in industry to the research and treatment of serious diseases. We want to make it the foundation of a fair, decentralized, highly networked and resilient economic system.
We are also experiencing systemic competition in the digital sector - between emancipatory digitalization that empowers citizens and strengthens freedom, and digitalization that disempowers citizens and promotes surveillance for economic or political interests. Europe must consciously position itself in this competition and take a big step towards being an attractive location for talent and innovative companies and thus help shape the rapid digital development. We therefore want to secure, strengthen and expand Europe's digital sovereignty.
The basis of European digital sovereignty is, among other things, a resilient and climate- friendly infrastructure, which includes broadband networks, mobile networks, hubs, data centers and the reliability of sensitive supply chains. We want to drive forward the development and production of infrastructure components in Europe, be it the production and development semiconductors, satellite communications and mobile communications technology. We want to shape the connection to the global network infrastructure, whether for submarine cables or nodes, with strong European players.
Digital sovereignty means the development and application of key technologies such as AI, quantum computing and communication in Europe.
Here, too, we can rely on strong European companies in various sectors and strengthen this development with a bundling o f measures - for example, targeted investments as part of the investment program for innovation, sovereignty and resilience.
Wherever possible, we advocate the preference for free and open source software.
software and open data solutions. For critical infrastructures in particular, the European Commission must work together with the Member States to ensure that European standards for
IT security without backdoors and innovative digital offerings "made in the EU", such as software for controlling energy and water supplies, rail infrastructure or health information systems.
Advancing digitalization also means taking it into account in political projects. We want to consider the digital implementation of proposed legislation as early as the legislative process. This will enable government services to be provided faster and more efficiently. Above all, the digitalization of administrative processes can help to make political rules - from the CBAM border adjustment mechanism to data protection - manageable in economic practice.
Shaping artificial intelligence in Europe
Progress in the development and application of AI represents a huge opportunity for many areas of life. It can serve people, simplify our lives and make our lives easier.
It can change and simplify processes in everyday life, education and science, administration and business. Modern AI-supported processes can help to reduce the use of water and pesticides and increase crop yields at the same time. They protect the environment and increase economic efficiency.
At the same time, new risks are emerging due to the rapid progress of AI. These range from large- scale cyberattacks through AI-supported vulnerability scans to the structural
discrimination of social groups to risks such as incorrect situation assessments in autonomous driving. We want to use AI in accordance with our shared values to ensure effective protection of human rights and equality. We therefore support research and technology impact assessment to accompany the introduction of this technology and advocate regulation not only at European but also at global level. We support the approach of regulating AI applications with regard to their potential risk and, where necessary, making the underlying source data transparent.
With the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, the EU is taking a major step in this direction, which is being noticed and closely monitored worldwide. We want to shape and harness the potential of AI. In addition to the availability of computing capacity, we also need support for specialists, better availability of data and support for research and transfer.
In addition to the international establishment of eco- logical IT standards, we want to develop and implement sustainability standards for software designs andoperate energy-intensive data centers in a climate-neutral manner in the future. Sustai- nability by design must be the rule for software and networked devices; the EU must develop sustainability standards for AI, cloud platforms, browsers, search engines, digital marketplaces and social networks. We are calling for a Digital Sustainability Act at EU level in order to focus the innovative strength of companies in information technologies more strongly on sustainability. We also want to integrate a waste heat infrastructure for data centers into the European energy infrastructure.
Use data based on rights
Data and the processing of large data sets are the basis for numerous innovative technologies and AI in particular. The smart use of data makes an important contribution to enriching our lives together and tackling numerous social problems
as well as social and ecological innovations, to conserve resources and to advance scientific research.
We want Europe to take a decisive step forward in the availability of data, as this is critical for our competitiveness.
are. This applies to the development of AI, the success of European AI models and our ability to innovate as a whole. To this end, we want to make non-personal data more usable and more easily accessible based on rights. To facilitate access to personal data, we are examining procedures for anonymization, pseudonymization and the possibilities of synthetic data gen- eration. We have contributed to the implementation of this principle in legislation on t h e use and improved exchange of data between companies as part of the data strategy. We are therefore committed to ensuring that the public administration publishes its data in machine-readable formats. Projects such as Smart City Barcelona can serve as an example of how data can be made available and how research and innovation can be driven forward.
With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has strongly shaped data protection worldwide in recent years and set global standards in the regulation of personal data protection.
However, enforcement of the rules in the member states varies. While Germany needs less bureaucracy and more legal certainty, the rules for international digital companies based in other member states must be enforced just as consistently. Due to lax enforcement in recent years, big tech companies in particular have been able to gain competitive advantages that are crucial for all sectors of the economy, especially in the areas of advertising, social networks and AI. The European Commission must therefore ensure that the GDPR is enforced uniformly and consistently in order to effectively protect fundamental rights and citizens' rights and create a level playing field for all companies that use a
Exclude special treatment of large corporations compared to SMEs. We want to use the upcoming evaluation of the GDPR to simplify the regulations and make them more practicable while maintaining the same level of data protection, also to take into account the special needs of SMEs and start-ups.
We see further potential to support users in enforcing their claims, simplify implementation for SMEs and create all-round legal certainty through the digitalization of data protection agreements and an automated information option for collected personal data. In this way, we give users more transparency and control over the processing of their personal data. In addition, the approach makes it easier for citizens to donate their data for research purposes and thus create the data pools required for AI models.
Setting digital standards
Trust and reliability are the be-all and end-all of successful digitalization for consumers and companies. This trust is promoted and guaranteed by common standards. We therefore advocate fair, open and resilient digital regulatory frameworks.
We pay particular attention to the necessary investment security for European companies, especially SMEs. Because only clear and reliable rules ensure innovative, trustworthy and therefore successful economic spaces. With the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we have taken important steps towards this in the EU. The completion of the digital single market can help Europe to be globally competitive.
A key to successful digital policy lies in interoperability: Europe's digital systems must speak the same language.
Interoperability refers to the ability of
IT systems to handle business processes across the boundaries of companies, authorities and research institutions - fully automatically,
without manual input or media disruptions. This requires the standardization of common software interfaces, specific to each use case. In this way, individuals, companies, research institutions and NGOs can carry out transactions with each other equally.
Experience shows that standardization can help innovative technologies achieve a breakthrough. Examples of this are the World Wide Web and digital mobile communications (GSM).
Interoperability breaks through monopolies, opening up economic areas and markets worth billions, which offer huge opportunities, especially for SMEs from Europe.
With the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), the EU has created an initial crystallization point that we are using as a starting point: In various groups, representatives of different interest groups are developing the standardized IT interfaces (profiles) for the respective application.
The development of these standards must be democratically legitimized. Arbitrary consortia of large international companies lack this. We therefore want to open up standardization to developers, civil society and SMEs. Their commitment must be remunerated so that everyone can participate in this design under the same conditions. We see it as a central task of the EU to monitor this democratic governance and ensure planning and investment security. These standards should be freely available and usable without license fees. The EU can also make a decisive contribution to enforcing these standards on the market through the power of the public sector as a customer.
Digitize consumer protection
Disinformation and hate are taking up more and more space in digital media and endangering social coexistence. The increasing relevance of software and digital platforms in society and our democracy must be reflected in consumer protection. Over the past few years, the EU has made significant progress in this area.
Progress has been made. With the DSA and the DMA, we in Europe have laid the foundations for creating clear rules on the internet and restoring competition. Big tech companies must now regularly assess the risk that their algorithms pose to society - and propose countermeasures where necessary. Under our pressure, scientists and NGOs will be given access to the platforms' data in order to research their effects and make them public. The advertising and tracking-based business models, whose algorithms prefer to show emotionalizing content in order to bind users to the respective platform, must also be put to the test.
The task now is to consistently enforce the DSA and the DMA in Germany and Europe and to further develop them based on the knowledge gained through data access. Laws to protect consumers in the digital space must be enforced and applied; to this end, we want to strengthen consumer protection agencies at national and European level. The regulation of digital platforms must take a closer look at the dominance of large digital marketplaces. In this context, fundamental rights are increasingly being violated on these platforms when users are blocked for no reason.
In addition to the rules of digital consumer protection, digital education is also an important building block to guarantee the rights and participation of all citizens in the digital social debate and to strengthen their information literacy.
We want to ensure fair competitive conditions that offer SMEs good access and do not expose consumers to unlimited market power. It must be ensured that SMEs can trade their products online under fair conditions. To this end, we will tighten up competition law if necessary. Digital business models must be sparing in their use of personal data. We want to strengthen the rights of users on digital communication platforms. Interoperability helps here:
Platforms should be able to communicate with each other so that users of different services can interact with each other. This will enable and improve the transfer of data so that users can access it when they leave platforms.
7. Circular economy
Reducing resource consumption and dependence on raw materials
The consumption and waste of resources contribute to the ecological and social crises of our time. We will therefore also campaign at European and international level for binding resource protection targets in order to reduce the absolute consumption of resources so that our economy comes into line with planning limits.
We need raw materials for a climate-neutral economy, the necessary technologies and products, because they are in the e-car on the road or the solar panel on the roof. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the demand for metallic raw materials for green energy technologies alone will quadruple by 2040 inordertomeet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. A large proportion of these raw materials are currently mined in countries of the Global South - and processed in smelters and refineries in the People's Republic of China.
German and European companies are dependent on imports for 75 to 100 percent of a number of metals. With China currently occupying the central position in the raw material supply chain, Europe must diversify its raw material sources in order to secure its own independence. A particular
The provision of high-quality secondary materials plays a particularly important role here. We therefore advocate the establishment of a European raw materials agency as well as regular and mandatory stress tests for affected companies in order to ensure the security of raw materials for the European economy.
With the EU Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), we have taken a major step towards greater raw material security. The aim of the CRMA is that no more than 65 percent of imports of critical raw materials may come from a single third country.
Our diversification approach is based on various pillars: the reduction of raw material consumption and the implementation of an effective circular economy, the substitution of particularly scarce raw materials, the use and further processing of domestic raw materials in the EU and the implementation of a sustainable foreign policy on raw materials, which focuses on the expansion of partnerships with countries worldwide and pursues ambitious sustainability goals. For greater raw material security and environmental protection, we want to implement outstanding legislative proposals from the Green Deal and the action plan for a circular economy in a timely manner - while adhering to the waste hierarchy. In doing so, we are focusing on ambitious avoidance, reuse and recycling targets as well as more eco- design instead of downcycling.
Circular economy
The smart use of resources is one of the key prerequisites for a competitive economy. The circular economy has arrived in the mainstream and we are making it a European model for success. The greatest contribution to raw material security is saving scarce raw materials and reusing them. The circular economy aims to ensure that materials and products are shared, leased, reused, repaired, refurbished and recycled for as long as possible.
and recycled and waste is reduced to a minimum. This starts with the design of new products. That is why we want to support resource-conserving, durable and environmentally friendly design in the sense of "Design for Reuse, Repair and Recycling". It is good that the Eco-design Directive is now being further developed in this sense. Consumer goods should meet stricter minimum criteria in orderto protect the climate and conserve resources.
Producers must consider the entire life cycle of their products so that not only production but also use and recycling are as sustainable as possible.
We
advocate a circular economy that prioritizes the preservation and renovation of existing buildings, promotes the reuse of building products and supports the expansion of digital building component exchanges. We focus on ecological and recycled building products, the digital building passport and a digital building material and component passport.
All too often, for example, a washing machine ends up in the bin because it is easier and cheaper to buy a new one than to have it repaired. This uses up resources unnecessarily and causes 35 million tons of waste from still usable goods in the EU every year. For a society without waste, we want to strengthen the right to repair, introduce an obligation to provide spare parts and minimize the destruction of new goods. Transparency and reliability for consumers through a durability and repair index for large household appliances, for example, and longer warranty periods can be key approaches here. This should also soon put an end to the destruction of returned goods from online retailers. In addition, we want to strengthen opportunities to rent and borrow products under socially just conditions.
We want to build on the EU textile strategy and achieve circular textile production with better durability, repairability, reusability and recyclability. To this end, we want to promote alternative business models such as repair, rental and sharing services for textiles.
We are still losing valuable raw materials for the production of goods due to incomplete
Rules. We want to put a stop to illegal waste exports by consistently implementing the new Waste Shipment Ordinance. We want to stop plastic pollution worldwide and are committed to ending plastic waste exports to third countries altogether. In the current negotiations on a global plastics agreement, the EU should advocate globally binding rules for sustainable product design and the promotion of plastic avoidance, reuse and recycling.
In order to increase security of supply in the EU, we need a European approach so that we can better coordinate the sources and processing of raw materials.
capacities on our continent effectively. This also includes the domestic mining of scarce raw materials and the strengthening of
processing capacities in the EU. We will work to ensure that the EU makes ambitious progress in this area in compliance with high sustainability and human rights standards.
We want to reduce the extraction of raw materials in opencast mining as much as possible.
However, sources of raw materials do not only exist underground: in our homes, infrastructures, but also in our landfills and dumps, there are sources of raw materials that we have not yet sufficiently tapped into. That is why we want to promote the consistent reuse and further utilization of raw materials through a circular economy that makes use of the opportunities offered by digital solutions and promotes urban mining. This will enable us to create new business models while reducing the need for scarce primary raw materials.
We want to introduce reusable and deposit systems throughout Europe and give them priority over single-use packaging. In order to achieve the national collection quotas for batteries, we want to create a Europe-wide deposit system for batteries. Reuse always has priority over recycling. The use of critical raw materials such as lithium should be replaced by less critical minerals, for example through the increased use of sodium-ion batteries. We want to provide further research funding for this.
Forming raw material partnerships
In order to diversify our sources of raw materials outside the EU, we are committed to a sustainable foreign raw materials policy. It aims to establish new and strategic partnerships in the raw materials sector and deepen existing partnerships. We support international cooperation formats such as the Mine- rals Security Partnership (MSP) and increased
G7 cooperation within the framework of the Critical Raw Materials Club.
In addition, we want to deepen partnerships with resource-rich countries around the world and thus support them in implementing and enforcing the UN Sustainable Development Goals and international human rights standards. We do not want to align cooperation offers unilaterally with European supply interests, but rather support partner countries in increasing their value creation in the raw materials sector. We want to work with them to build the green supply chains of the future and give the population a share in the profits from resource extraction. We want to support countries in this task via the Global Gateway and other financing initiatives and, in this context, also promote the expansion of transportation and energy infrastructure.
8. Modern mobility
Advancing Europe's transport transition
Everyone in Europe should have the opportunity to be mobile in a climate-friendly, barrier-free, safe and affordable way. We are committed to ensuring that climate-friendly mobility is also the most attractive in terms of price and affordable for everyone. This includes ensuring that people can move around comfortably even without their own car. To achieve this, we are modernizing the European rail network and making it the backbone of the infrastructure union. For a successful transport transition throughout Europe, we need modern, well- developed rail routes and attractive trains across borders, a dense network of cycle paths and cycle routes, barrier-free pedestrian traffic, the expansion of e-charging infrastructure, a safe road network, climate-friendly air and sea traffic and attractive offers to combine different modes of transport.
Integrated urban development and spatial
planning with the concept of short distances make a decisive contribution to this. With the instrument of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), we want to promote this in all major European cities. Innovative means of transportation and new
We want to support mobility solutions such as cable cars or autonomous local public transport.
Such a turnaround in transportation is a central building block for a good and self-determined life in harmony with climate protection - in the city and in the countryside. We are committed to the further development of the European rail network, also in order to promote climate-friendly tourism in Europe. To this end, the expansion of the Trans- European Transport Networks (TEN-T) rail network must be completed much faster and with a higher share of EU funding. The restoration of gaps between countries, European freight transport and good night trains are also a priority for us. We want to create further incentives for shifting freight to rail and inland waterways. For this we need
We are creating a standardized Europe-wide freight train network with fast loading terminals for combined transport, where loads can be transferred from trucks to trains. This will make the environmentally friendly transportation of goods more competitive, more reliable and cheaper. In the medium term, we want to expand the German cycle into a European cycle.
Night trains are a comfortable and climate-friendly way to travel long distances within Europe and are therefore a good alternative to flying. A massive expansion of barrier-free night train services is therefore necessary. We are therefore advocating reduced track access charges, better funding for cross-border trains, the rapid expansion of rail infrastructure and, in particular, an industrial policy offensive for modern sleeping cars.
Strengthening the rail and bicycle industry offers great employment potential
in development, production and maintenance. In particular, the industrial policy potential of the bicycle industry for local, resource-efficient production is far from exhausted. We are therefore advocating a European cycling strategy that also includes the construction of safe cycle paths and the promotion of the private and commercial use of cargo bikes.
Book tickets easily
What is a matter of course when booking flights should also be standard for all train journeys in Europe in future. With a cross-provider ticketing system, we can enable booking platforms to offer cross-border, end-to-end tickets including sharing offers as well as boarding and alighting assistance for everyone. The cheapest tickets will be made easily accessible. Travelers will receive clear and transparent information on costs, travel times, accessibility and the climate impact of each travel option and will be able to choose the best option for them. To bring Europe closer together by rail, bookings must be simplified.
This should also apply to the offline sale of tickets. It should be easier to reserve Interrail tickets. We want to invite people to travel with confidence and therefore strengthen passenger rights. For example, travelers should be able to use any next train or bus in the event of a train cancellation, even if it is operated by another company.
Consistent implementation of the open data principle with open interfaces in public transport should also ensure that mobility services can be used easily and cheaply by everyone throughout Europe. In particular, sharing models and the combination of different means of transport, for example e-bike and train or park and ride, should benefit from this. In order to promote climate- friendly and barrier-free mobility, we want to enable passengers to take bicycles on new trains and ensure the right to transport necessary mobility aids free of charge.
We also want to strengthen the flat-rate principle in public transport in Europe, which we have successfully established in our own country with the Deutschland-Ticket. The Deutschland-Ticket should also be valid in the first state in the neighboring country in order to strengthen cross- border exchange. Flat-rate tickets with a similar principle should be mutually recognized. In this way, we are gradually achieving that
with a Europaticket you can use local transport in the
throughout the EU.
Implementing the drive turnaround
We want to design comprehensive offers for climate-neutral mobility: Attractive public transport enables a traffic turnaround and, in combination with integrated urban planning for shorter journeys, even a mobility turnaround. In this way, we make it possible for everyone to get around comfortably, even without their own car, with reliable and cost-effective services. And for the climate, at the heart of the mobility and transport transition is the drive transition, which ensures that things move in a climate-neutral and quiet way. The principle of operating as many means of transport as possible electrically with renewable energies must apply. We support the use of green hydrogen and the e-fuels based on it in shipping and air traffic. In road transport, however, we reject the use of e-fuels due to their lack of energy efficiency as well as their lack of climate and environmental friendliness. We only promote green hydrogen in road transport for heavy commercial vehicles.
As a key industry, the automotive industry provides many jobs. We want to support the industry - andin particular its employees - on the path to climate- neutral and resource-efficient mobility services. In a historic decision, the EU has decided that from 2035, no more fossil combustion engines may be newly registered in passenger cars. By 2030, emissions from new passenger cars are also to be reduced by 55 percent compared to 2021.
The CO2 reduction of passenger car drives by 2035 is to be pursued consistently and even more ambitiously than before. This is good for the
Germany as a business location, climate protection and consumers. Now we want to ensure that it is just as easy to drive an e-car to the nearest train station as it is to go on a family vacation. We have laid the foundation for a nationwide, intelligently networked and efficient charging infrastructure for all means of transport with the reform of the Alternative Fuels Ordinance: Over the next few years
sufficient charging points for cars and trucks set up on long-distance roads and in rural areas. Charging points must display their prices transparently.
Customers must be able to pay simply, transparently and without excessive roaming charges.
We also want to create incentives for e-vehicles to make them lighter and even more energy-efficient.
The proportion of freight traffic that remains on the road will in future be largely battery-electric. This requires the rapid expansion of the charging infrastructure for trucks along Europe's long- distance roads, in depots and freight distribution centers. We have successfully campaigned for this and will continue to do so. At the same time, the networks need to be efficiently upgraded to make them fit for the future.
New cars and other means of transport should be more closely aligned with the circular economy through efficiency standards right from the manufacturing and development stages.
and general energy and resource efficiency. We want to create greater incentives for manufacturers to offer lighter and more efficient solutions and reduce emissions, for example through tire and brake wear. By providing consumer-friendly information on the weight and carbon footprint of vehicles, we are ensuring greater transparency and making purchasing decisions easier.
In order to make heavy air and shipping traffic climate-neutral, we are supporting the production of sustainable fuels from renewable energies, for example e-kerosene, promoting fuel-saving technologies and the rapid development of a climate-neutral energy supply in ports, in particular a climate-neutral shore-side electricity supply. This will make fossil and biogenic fuels in transport a thing of the past in a generation. We are developing a European port strategy that ensures fair competitive conditions between European ports and strengthens the resilience of the European maritime location, also in the face of foreign investors who are looking to acquire and otherwise control the European maritime infrastructure. The port strategy optimizes the
investment needs, strengthens our continent in global supply chains and protects against too much influence from authoritarian states. We need
They are also needed to prevent further ecological damage caused by competition between locations for ever deeper shipping channels. We promote rail and inland waterway transport to ensure good hinterland connections. By including shipping in EU emissions trading, we are achieving a binding reduction in emissions.
We support the research and development of climate-neutral technologies for air travel. Shifting air traffic to more climate-friendly alternatives - especially for short-haul flights - remains our goal. We are calling for the EU-wide introduction of an air traffic tax based on energy content, similar to the one already levied in Germany. The majority of the resulting revenue should go to the EU budget. This should not put European airlines at a disadvantage compared to their international competitors.
Making traffic safe
We are pursuing Vision Zero for road traffic. Our goal is to ensure that there are no more traffic accidents with fatalities and serious injuries. We are committed to a safe transport infrastructure for everyone, especially children and the elderly. Municipal decision-making sovereignty over
Our goal remains a 30 km/h speed limit in urban areas and an EU-wide speed limit on major roads. We want to continue to promote the voluntary retrofitting of turning assistance systems in trucks in ordertoachieve the fullest possible coverage as quickly as possible.
Noise is still underestimated as a health factor. We are committed to more ambitious reduction targets for traffic. We want to make airplanes, trains, cars and motorcycles more responsible for people's health. To this end, we want to further develop the EU Environmental Noise Directive and source- related noise directives (e.g. limit values for vehicle noise emissions) and adapt them to the state of the art. Multiple pollution
We want to take greater account of this. In this way, the impact of traffic on people's health can be reduced by up to 50 percent. Nitrogen oxide, (ultra) fine dust, tire and brake abrasion must also be minimized to protect health. The Clean Air Directive and the
Euro 7 emissions standard are important steps in this direction. We are also striving to harmonize the European rules for environmental zones.
In lower airspace, new forms of mobility must be measured against the benefits they bring to society. We therefore advocate for regulations that only permit these in harmony with the protection of people, nature and the environment and under high safety requirements. We want to strengthen the right of local authorities to actively participate in the planning and design of airspace for drone operations over their territory.
9. Intact nature
Preserving our nature
We are part of nature. Our prosperity, our quality of life, our future and our survival depend on it.
Protecting nature and ensuring that we can continue to use it responsibly and respectfully in the future is a crucial political task. The
This is not least because the wealth of European habitats - from the almost untouched forests of northern and south-eastern Europe to the countless lakes and diverse cultural landscapes of Central Europe and the Mediterranean - shapes our self-image as Europeans and stands for our continent worldwide.
Thanks to our efforts in Germany and Europe, we have achieved major breakthroughs here in recent months:
The EU Nature Restoration Law (NRL), the agreements reached at the World Conference on Nature in Montreal in 2022 and the UN agreement on the protection of biodiversity on the high seas are historic milestones.
ne. Thanks to these agreements, 30 percent of land and sea areas are to be under nature conservation, 10 percent of the areas even under special protection. The task now is to fully implement the agreed targets and restoration plans, as well as the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and to set binding interim targets and measures. We therefore advocate the creation of a network of well-monitored and effective protected areas on land and at sea, including zero-use zones.
Endangered species and habitats should finally be better protected and damaged ecosystems restored.
Binding rules for the protection of the high seas were also agreed for the first time. Overall, marine resources may now only be used sustainably. With the NRL, we in the European Parliament have set our continent o n course for the urgently needed restoration of European nature. We must now put these plans into practice: Significantly improved nature conservation funding and a reorientation of agricultural and fisheries subsidies towards ecological use are essential for achieving global and European goals. That is why we are calling for a dedicated nature conservation fund in the EU budget. We want to finance the restoration of nature by comprehensively reducing environmentally harmful subsidies. The NRL aims to put all ecosystems on the road to recovery by 2050. We are working towards rapid and complete implementation of the targets and interim targets. When intervening in nature, unjustifiable risks such as the endangerment or even extinction of entire populations or species through genetic engineering methods must be ruled out.
We also want to strengthen the legal framework in environmental law. In order to prosecute environmental crimes, we support the reform of the EU Environmental Criminal Law Directive and the outlawing of the most serious environmental crimes as part of the amendment to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. At the same time, we are working in Germany and the EU to prevent further sealing of agricultural, forest and natural areas.
and consistently - with the aim of achieving a circular economy.
Saving biodiversity
Alongside the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis - the rapid extinction of species - is the second global crisis affecting our livelihoods and our
Health threatened. Both crises are interdependent. Essential ecosystem services such as pollination, soil fertility, erosion control, water and carbon storage as well as the recreational function are under threat. At the same time, intact nature is our most important ally in the fight against the climate crisis. Nature conservation and climate protection must therefore be considered together. This is why we combine the faster implementation of climate protection measures and the expansion of renewable energies with compliance with the highest ecological protection standards, in particular the European Flora-Fauna-Habitat and Birds Directives.
In order to tackle the climate and biodiversity crisis together, we particularly want to promote natural climate protection. The key elements here are the rewetting of moors and floodplains, the preservation and renaturation of species-rich grassland, near-natural forest conversion, which also protects animals and plants, and effective marine protection.
We are committed to ensuring that there will be no deep-sea mining until there is sufficient scientific knowledge about its effects and serious environmental damage can be ruled out. After all, alongside peatlands and forests, the oceans are among the most important allies in the fight against the climate and biodiversity crisis.
Intact ecosystems can only exist with a vibrant diversity of species. Of the 8 million animal and plant species on our planet, 1 million are threatened with extinction - and thus an infinite wealth. This mass extinction must be stopped as a matter of urgency. An important lever for this is the way in which we cultivate land. We want to stop the loss of species in and around agricultural land and forests by reducing the use of land.
and strengthen nature conservation in the management of land. The preservation of ecosystems and the protection of key species in particular, which are essential for the functioning of biotic communities, must therefore always be given high priority.
become. We want to promote organic farming and near-natural forest management. This protects our soils as well as animals and plants and increases biodiversity. Europe's forests are severely threatened by the consequences of the ongoing climate crisis. We are committed to moving away from monocultural management, significantly reducing the use of pesticides and promoting a near-natural transformation, primarily based on natural regeneration. The valuable old-growth forests
in Europe and make 10% of the EU's forests available for natural development. Illegal deforestation and clear-cutting must be stopped. Instead, reforestation should be specifically promoted. This requires uniform minimum ecological standards for forestry throughout Europe. Natural wood is
a versatile raw material for construction and housing that is too valuable to burn in large power plants. In view of the increasing drought and heat, we also need a European forest fire strategy that reduces the risk of fire through comprehensive preventive measures, near-natural forests, the avoidance of clear-cutting and ecological protection corridors.
We want to reconnect natural habitats to preserve biodiversity. The aim is to create a sustainable green infrastructure for Europe's nature. We want to restore the Natura 2000 network to a good conservation status and link it with corridors that strengthen exchange. This is because intact habitats and genetic diversity promote the resilience of our ecosystems and thus also create added value for society. The corridors should be created in close cooperation with local authorities, farmers, forest owners and foresters. Financial incentives for farmers and landowners should serve the goal of introducing sustainable practices that promote the protection of nature and the preservation of biodiversity. Measures for ecological land use such as
Multifunctional agroforestry systems or the creation of hedges at the edge of fields can be important tools for creating a network of biotopes and new habitats. In this context, we want to restore climate-resilient ecosystems and create alternative protection areas for cold-loving species as well as aid programs for particularly affected species.
We want to advance the Montreal Convention on Biological Diversity through a global implementation mechanism with concrete instruments. The aim is to effectively protect nature on 30 percent of the earth's surface and to restore 30 percent of the area already in use. To this end, the financial resources pledged by the EU must be used quickly, effectively and in a partner- oriented manner. Global biodiversity partnerships should enable comprehensive cooperation for the protection of ecosystems and the restoration of nature
- also together with civil society and municipal actors.
Protect the environment
Alongside the climate and biodiversity crisis, increasing pollution and littering is the third major challenge for the protection of our natural resources. It puts a strain on ecosystems and our health. Environmental pollution from chemicals and plastic waste plays a central role here. We want to ensure that the planetary boundaries are observed here too. It is particularly urgent to focus on substances that cause lasting damage to humans and ecosystems. These include so-called perpetual chemicals such as perfluorinated and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFAS). These have been widely used for decades, for example in the production of semiconductors, medical products, textiles and refrigerants. Wherever they can be easily replaced, and especially in consumer products, we want to phase out their use quickly.
At the same time, we need a differentiated
regulatory framework to strengthen the development of alternatives and accelerate the production ramp-up of important future technologies.
gies such as electrolyzers or electric drives
not to jeopardize the health of our employees. Among other things through proper
We want to continue to ensure the production of important future technologies with the right transitional periods, but at the same time accelerate the replacement of PFAS in these areas through a research offensive and strengthen the research and development of non-toxic production methods. In doing so, we will be guided by the latest scientific findings.
We are also committed to a chemicals strategy that truly implements sustainability requirements, especially for toys, food contact materials and cosmetics. We therefore want to make faster progress with the reform of the European instrument for the safety of chemicals (REACH regulation). We advocate the use of a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment that takes into account different dimensions of the impact of chemicals, faster procedures and better sanctioning options. Effective strategies are also needed,
halve the environmentally harmful effects of chemicals by 2030 in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity. In order to better protect important environmental assets, we want to improve the Environmental Liability Directive and implement the polluter pays principle.
In the EU, we advocate ambitious international agreements and cooperation to curb global pollution and environmentally harmful practices. Our aim is to establish an international chemicals law within the framework of the circular economy that takes risks into account in accordance with the precautionary principle and regulates the production of demonstrably harmful substances.
We reject the export of pesticides banned in the EU to other countries. Above all, however, we want to make our chemical industry sustainable and thus fit for the future. That is why we are advocating a new investment program for safe and sustainable chemicals "made in EU" (EU Sustainable Chemistry Act) to promote the market ramp-up of green chemistry. This is part of our program for a climate- friendly industrial policy.
Clean water for all
As the climate crisis progresses, extreme droughts and heavy rainfall events are also increasing significantly in Europe. Germany, for example, has lost 20 percent of its water reserves over the past 20 years. Regionally, this has had catastrophic consequences in some cases. We therefore need a European water strategy that buffers extremes, ensures clean drinking water for all and meets the needs of agriculture and natural habitats. We need landscapes, villages and cities that store water in the ground to get us through the hot and dry summers.
to bring. Clean water for all is a basic right. We are reducing water consumption by promoting climate-adapted land management, protecting wetlands, renaturalizing water bodies, rewetting moors and wanting to allow more and more rivers to flow freely again. We also maintain clean water by reducing the pollutant load in water, for example from mercury or PFAS, and by further strengthening the polluter pays principle for the
discharge of pollutants and wastewater treatment. In addition to the Nature Restoration Act, the objectives of the Water Framework Directive must also be implemented in the current decade in order toachieve good quality rivers and lakes throughout Europe and prevent the overexploitation of groundwater and the resulting threat of damage to wetlands and rivers.
In order to cope with the consequences of the climate crisis, we want to increase funding for the EU's climate adaptation strategy, including a European heat action plan for cross-sectoral measures, from warning levels to infra-structural adaptations. The expansion of European civil protection is necessary in order to cope with the increasing number of extreme events.
We are committed to the conversion to a climate- resilient water infrastructure and nature-friendly flood protection. We are reducing the risk of flooding caused by heavy rainfall events by giving streams and rivers more space again through an unsealing offensive and more rainwater storage. In the
In rural regions, we support the agricultural sector in creating its own water reserves by developing sponge farms in which water is stored as a reserve for times of drought, to replenish groundwater and for other uses such as paludiculture, fish farming and as recreational water. In the cities, green spaces, trees and green roofs help. The conversion to a sponge city also provides cooling, improves air quality and increases biodiversity. In this way, we can better prepare our cities for the consequences of the climate crisis.
We need Europe-wide cooperation, clear limits and rules to ensure that transnational water crises such as the one on the Oder are prevented in the future. We are committed to the goal of restoring 25,000 kilometers of free-flowing rivers in the EU - as envisaged in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. We want to prevent the planned expansion of the Oder for transport purposes in cooperation with the riparian states, as this endangers one of the last natural and free-flowing rivers in Europe. We advocate a binding priority for drinking water over commercial or agricultural use. Water belongs to everyone and is not an object of speculation. We therefore reject the privatization of the water supply.
We will focus on the economical use and storage of water in the landscape and strengthen this through rules and incentives, whether in arable farming through drought-tolerant crops or humus build-up, in vegetable growing through drip irrigation, in forests through near-natural, hardwood-oriented mixed forests or in trade and industry through more economical processes, closed water cycles, limited water withdrawal, cascade use and recycling. We are increasingly focusing on cooperation within Europe and with the countries bordering the Mediterranean.
After all, the experience gained in the arid regions of the south is urgently needed in other parts of Europe.
Protect animals
We also consistently take sides with animals. Society has a special responsibility for animals in human care. We want the EU to protect all animals through consistent and ambitious legislation and the enforcement of existing regulations. Because Europeans want animal welfare: six of the ten successful citizens' initiatives in the EU are committed to this.
We are following this wish and are campaigning for animal welfare as an EU common goal, explicit political responsibility for animal welfare in the EU Commission and EU funding for animal welfare.
We call for the implementation of the "Fur Free Europe" initiative to ban fur farming and the trade in farmed fur products on the European market.
Building on this, we are committed to the consistent implementation of the EU action plan to combat illegal species trade. International species protection agreements, in particular CITES and all its annexes, must be consistently implemented in the EU. We want to effectively prevent the commercial wildlife trade. Targeted research and species protection programs by scientific institutions and experts on non- commercial wildlife trade should be implemented.
The import and trade of illegally exported specimens should be made punishable. The import and trade of specimens illegally exported from their country of origin should be made a punishable offense. We are in favor of a ban on the import of hunting trophies from animal species protected by the Washington Convention and the EU Endangered Species Regulation, as already called for by the EU Parliament. We want to relieve the burden on animal shelters by, among other things, labeling and registering dogs and cats as well as a positive list for the trade and keeping of exotic animals. We advocate high animal welfare standards in trade agreements.
We want to put an end to the import of animal products for which conditions have not been verified in accordance with EU animal welfare standards. We want to make animal welfare a goal of sustainable development.
The EU and member states should draw up concrete plans for phasing out animal testing that consistently end experiments on animals for cosmetics and wherever possible for chemical testing and medical products. The number of animal experiments for drug development and basic research should be reduced. Animal-free education and training initiatives should be promoted. We want to strengthen and accelerate the development, recognition and broad application of animal-free methods in practice.
Once recognized, they should be immediately included in test guidelines and replace animal testing. Whereitis not yet possible to completely dispense with animal testing, they must be implemented as gently as possible for the animals. The standards applicable in the EU should also apply to imports from other parts of the world.
10. A strong agriculture
Reorganizing the common agricultural policy
Farmers provide us in Europe with a variety of valuable foods. At the same time, agriculture shapes our cultural landscapes, the fields, meadows and vineyards that characterize Europe. We want to strengthen an agriculture that works in harmony with nature, in the service of all people, producers and consumers alike.
We are therefore striving for a fundamental reform of EU agricultural policy that consistently rewards services for the common good - in particular measures for the climate, water, soil, biodiversity, health and animal welfare - rather than land ownership. This r e q u i r e s clear regulations and incentives for the reduction of pesticide use, fertilization and livestock numbers as well as for crop rotation, the cultivation of protein crops and extensive grassland farming. business.	The	funding	should	be	low	in bureaucracy, enable planning security, have a sustainable impact and directly benefit those working on the ground.
farmers - especially smaller farms. A good approach is to use level and points systems that clearly focus on
The aim is to promote the common good, ecological measures and regenerative systems such as agroforestry systems, promote multi- annual measures and view farms as a system. Animal welfare promotion should be made mandatory by the Member States in their strategic plans. We want to create additional incentives for extensive grazing. Further developing organic farming should become the guiding principle of European agricultural policy. We call for a clear alignment with the objectives of the Farm to Fork Strategy and the NRL.
When promoting rural areas, we want to focus not only on the necessary infrastructure for a good life and social cohesion, but also on the (re)development of decentralized artisanal food processing, regional value chains, the diversification of agricultural businesses and the strengthening of producer groups. There is also new potential for more value creation in the energy sector - for example through
Agri-photovoltaics or by using agricultural machinery as electricity storage in the energy transition.
In view of the major ecological challenges in agriculture, we are also dependent on further innovation. Digitalization can help tomake agriculture more sustainable. For example, through GPS-controlled hoeing devices or in fertilization. This can save on fertilizers and pesticides. We want to protect the rights of farmers when it comes to the data they collect and access to the software of their machines ("right to repair").
We can thus shape EU agricultural policy in such a way that it offers prospects to all women and men working in agriculture, especially career changers and start-ups, because every farm counts. By creatingregional value chains from farm to fork - also digitally through product passports
and supply chain monitoring - and strengthen the food trade, we improve their economic framework conditions. In doing so, we are also promoting local food distribution channels.
Farmers must be strengthened vis-à-vis processors and retailers in the value chain. Retailers in particular can and must make a greater contribution to stabilizing revenues for producers and prices for consumers.
We are therefore campaigning for Europe-wide regulations to put an end to price dumping in the food sector.
Good food for everyone
Food is a central part of our culture and individual identity. Nutrition is crucial to our health and our quality of life. We want to make good nutrition possible for everyone. This is also a contribution to strengthening regional economic areas, as the production and processing of food locally creates well-being and regional identity.
Everyone should be able to decide for themselves what goes on their plate. The EU can protect consumers' freedom of choice by providing reliable information about the origin and content of food.
We are therefore advocating Europe-wide mandatory labels to support sustainable, regional and plant-based nutrition. We want to introduce mandatory labeling for animal husbandry in the European single market. On the other hand, misleading practices with private labels that advertise supposedly climate-neutral products, for example, should be put a stop to under the EU Green Claims Regulation.
We are setting the course for sustainability with an EU-wide framework for sustainable food systems. For example, we want to create incentives for better nutrition in communal catering, from daycare centers to hospitals, through changes to public procurement law. We want to create an environment in which it is easy to eat healthily and sustainably - along the lines of the planetary health approach.
- to eat. We want food to be free from chemical residues such as pesticides and hormones. By continuously increasing the proportion of organic food from regional production in communal catering, we are expanding reliable sales markets for organic farming. In this way, we are creating sustainable and healthy nutrition for everyone, especially children.
We want to increase the range of plant-based products, make them more easily accessible and change the EU's food-related funding programs to make them climate-friendly. This is also important for achieving climate and species protection goals. We are therefore improving the framework conditions for plant-based foods by promoting research and market launches, among other things. In order to better counter future crises, the EU needs a protein strategy with efficient approval procedures that increase the self-sufficiency rate for vegetables, nuts and plant-based and alternative proteins. We support the research and development of modern fermentation processes and cell cultivation to a new extent for the development of sustainable food and for Europe as a location for business and innovation.
We are in favor of agriculture that conserves resources and is environmentally friendly and is based on the principles of organic farming with its principles of animal welfare, freedom from genetic engineering and freedom from synthetic pesticides.
As with any technology, the political compass for dealing with both old and new genetic engineering methods must guarantee the freedom of research on the one hand and exclude risks to humans and the environment during application on the other. New genetic engineering methods in agriculture should also be researched with regard to their opportunities, risks and consequences. For sustainable and transparent agriculture
It is essential that companies that want to operate GMO-free can do so safely. A strict approval procedure and the precautionary principle enshrined in European law must be upheld. To this end, risk assessments on a comprehensive
We need a scientific basis and regulation that excludes uncontrollable spread and protects GMO- free production and consumers' freedom of choice through mandatory labeling. We reject patents on plants and animals. This will secure the future of small and medium-sized farms and breeding operations in particular.
Food belongs on the plate and not in the tank or even in the bin. We therefore advocate legally binding measures to halve food waste by 2030, including the reassessment of sorting characteristics and supermarket standards as well as the introduction of consumption dates instead of best-before dates to provide more binding information on the safe consumption of food.
Shaping agriculture ecologically
Europe's agriculture must become more sustainable in order to secure the food supply of the future. In times of climate crisis, droughts, fires, storms and heavy rainfall, resilient cultivation systems are becoming the focus of all agricultural policy measures. This includes improving soil fertility and health, binding more CO2 than we emit, cultivating a greater diversity of crops and varieties in the fields and limiting the use of pesticides and synthetic chemical fertilizers as much as possible. We are guided by the criteria of regionality, circular economy and agroecology as well as the guiding principle of organic farming.
Our goal is to achieve a 25% share of organic
f a r m i n g by 2030 and to increase this share by 2035.
and beyond. In Germany, organic farms generate a higher income per person than conventional farms. This shows that it is already financially worthwhile to invest in regional and sustainable farming methods. We want to strengthen the framework conditions for this.
This also includes the EU's research and funding policy. It needs at least 30 percent of the funds earmarked for agricultural research.
and rural development, for the further development and promotion of the greening of agriculture and innovative concepts for the organic value chain, as well as for organic breeding research. We want to improve the EU organic label and its application - for example in animal husbandry. Organic farms should no longer have to provide double evidence, but should be recognized as organic due to their environmental performance.
"green by definition" apply.
For sustainable and transparent agriculture, it is essential that farms that want to operate GMO- free can do so safely. The EU should guarantee that everyone knows what they are eating and where it was produced. Transparency and freedom of choice must be ensured, especially in the case of genetically modified feed and food. We reject patents on plants, regardless of whether they originate from conventional breeding or genetic engineering.
The heavy use of pesticides pollutes our natural environment in many ways. However, the European plans adopted to date to reduce pollutants have not yet been sufficiently implemented.
We want to change this and ensure that the EU's targets and approval procedures are revised on a scientific basis. We want to oblige the member states to take further effective measures, such as a pesticide levy. Despite the setback in the European Commission's decision to extend the approval of glyphosate, we are continuing to fight for a ban on glyphosate in the EU as quickly as possible.
We are closing legal loopholes that currently allow the use of fertility-damaging chemicals in fertilizers or microplastics in pesticides, for example. In the approval process for pesticides, the relevant authorities must become more independent of the applicant manufacturers and their claims.
Manufacturers must no longer be able to choose in which Member State the authorities examine their applications. In addition, risk assessments must be developed and taken into account for other endangered animal groups. To save time and capacity
To ensure that we gain a competitive edge, we are accelerating the approval process for substances for which it is clear at an early stage that they cannot be approved due to exclusion criteria. We are also committed t o t h e consistent implementation of the polluter pays principle so that companies that use pesticides in are liable for any damage caused, for example to groundwater or organic farming.
Securing food with sustainability
Agriculture is suffering particularly from the climate crisis with long droughts and sudden heavy rainfall. If we put an end to over- fertilization, reduce the use of fossil fertilizers and turn soils back into CO2 sinks, agriculture is a key part of natural climate protection. That is why we are committed to rewetting peatlands, building up humus in arable soils and building up wood mass in agroforestry systems - with stable income prospects for farmers. In this way, agriculture can make the necessary contribution to climate protection and climate adaptation.
The rewetting of peatlands can only be achieved together with farmers. It is important to us that value creation is maintained in the peatland regions. That is why we support farmers in the cultivation of rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) and also promote the production of raw materials for climate-friendly building and insulation materials as well as for the soil industry and the establishment of new value chains in rural areas. We want to promote the use of rewetted peatlands as part of the CAP and reduce climate- damaging subsidies. Peatlands are real climate protectors, as significantly more carbon is stored here than in arable soil.
Pasture farming with suckler cow husbandry is one of the most animal-friendly forms of husbandry and contributes to species conservation. This is another reason why we want to give it more support.
Agroforestry systems, in which areas that have been farmed or grazed are planted with trees and shrubs.
The combination of shrubbery and organic farming is feasible with both organic and conventional agriculture. They are important for climate protection, soil fertility, the water balance and biodiversity, and thus for the development of resilient ecosystems. The diversification of business sectors creates greater income security for farmers. To ensure that the many positive effects can be realized, we want to remove barriers, promote research into them and develop their broader application in practice.
The European seas and their fish stocks are in a poor state. We will therefore better protect the marine environment in order to give fish stocks and our fishermen a sustainable perspective. That is why we support the Commission's action plan for the conservation of fisheries resources and the protection of marine ecosystems and are committed to faster and full implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The planetary boundaries must also be respected in the use of the oceans. We promote alternatives to gillnet and trawl fishing and take action against environmentally harmful fishing methods and excessive inputs of fertilizers and pollutants.
Keeping animals well
We want to shape animal husbandry in such a way that it respects the needs of animals as living beings and can supply sustainably produced, valuable food. The aim is to achieve land-based animal husbandry as quickly as possible. We support farms in this process. We see natural grazing as an integral part of our diverse landscapes. Industrial livestock farming, on the other hand, causes great animal suffering and endangers essential livelihoods and human health: Zoonotic pathogens, multi-resistant germs, drinking water pollution, habitat destruction, loss of species, food waste in animal fattening and excessive greenhouse gas emissions - when we harm animals, we ultimately harm ourselves.
In future, the number of animals we keep in European agriculture must be based on the Paris Climate Protection Agreement. We therefore want to keep fewer animals, significantly improve their husbandry conditions and focus breeding more on animal health. We are therefore committed to the establishment, improvement and better control of uniform Europe-wide animal welfare standards for breeding, husbandry, transport, killing and trade. This includes the end of cage and crate farming as well as the lack of fire safety precautions.
Accordingly, the funding framework is to be geared towards land-based animal husbandry and special support is to be given to pasture and grassland- based husbandry. The aim is to give animals considerably more space and year-round access to the outside and to ensure that they no longer have to stand on fully slatted floors. We need a significant reduction in live animal transports, a limit on long-distance transports to a maximum of eight hours and an end to animal transports to third countries outside the Schengen area. This also strengthens local processing. When it comes to slaughter, we demand better controls and advocate better, mandatory stunning methods, including for fish, crabs, lobsters and squid. We also want to make it possible to slaughter at the farm of origin if a certificate of competence is available and a veterinarian is present. The killing of chicks should be banned throughout the EU.
Human and animal health is under massive threat from the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock farming. Currently, more antibiotics are administered to healthy animals than to sick people. We want to drastically reduce the use of antibiotics in order to prevent the development of multi-resistant germs, which pose one of the greatest threats to human health. This requires a switch to better forms of husbandry, an increase in animal health, the restriction of group treatment and priority treatment of sick individual animals.
Reserve antibiotics should be reserved for human medicine. In animal breeding, we want to put an end to artificial stimulation using hormones from horse blood.
 What protects justice 
Inflation with the rising cost of living, the pandemic, war and increasing weather extremes have presented many people across Europe with major challenges. Many have had to accept painful cuts due to the price increases. Many self- employed people and small businesses have lost their livelihoods. And skyrocketing living costs are causing acute, sometimes even existential hardship far into the middle of society.
At the same time, the crisis management of recent years has shown what is possible whenwe stand together - in Germany and Europe.
In these times of crisis, people are longing for stability and cohesion. Europe offers the answer. European unification has raised the standard of living of millions of people and brought more social security. We are convinced that, especially in times of crisis, people in Europe must be able to rely on a strong welfare state that provides effective protection against poverty and social exclusion.
The EU can offer a protective space that secures social rights across borders and for the entire breadth of society. At the same time, the EU can provide the economic framework conditions that enable fair prosperity. A prosperity that must reach those who create it - a prosperity for the many. By building the infrastructure for a climate-neutral economy across Europe, we generate added value and maintain and create good jobs for millions of people: Economic and social infrastructure go hand in hand and are interdependent.
The strong and fair Europe that we want to shape is essentially aimed at protecting each and every individual andrespecting the achievements of all. It protects the rights of workers against exploitation. It respects the dignity of
pensioners and the unemployed. It reduces inequality. It secures citizens' entitlement to effective medication and access to high-quality and inclusive healthcare. It ensures that consumers can assert their claims. It helps to ensure that families and the elderly are better protected, children have a good future and older people play an active role in society. It enables young people to gain new experiences.
Europe is more than just an economic area. The European Union is also a social union committed to social progress. Europe is characterizedbythe promise of a life in dignity and freedom, of good working and living conditions, of equal opportunities and a livelihood without poverty, exclusion or discrimination - a promise of justice to the breadth of society.
We are committed to ensuring that this promise is now kept everywhere. To this end, we want to further strengthen the social dimension of the EU. We want to improve the conditions so that all Europeans can live and work even more easily and securely anywhere in the Union. This will turn social security into more freedom.
To this end, we want a Europe that sets binding standards - for fair wages and strong trade unions, against arbitrariness and exploitation. This will ultimately benefit everyone in the EU, whether in prosperous or poorer regions. In this way, the social infrastructure complements the economic infrastructure; in this way, we fulfill the European aspiration of an infrastructure union for all; in this way, we create cohesion across the entire continent. Because clear minimum standards effectively prevent a race to the bottom in social security.
We stand for a strong social Europe that protects people from crises and provides a local
makes a real difference. When we talk about European sovereignty, we are also talking about shaping and defending a European social model that holds its own in a globalized world - and stands for prosperity and material security, good work and high social standards. This applies all the more as the challenge of climate neutrality, technological progress and demographic change are transforming the world of work.
The European Pillar of Social Rights sets out the principles for a social Europe.
It is an important milestone in a coordinated European social policy. But it must not stop at principles and recommendations. We want to derive legally binding and enforceable labor and social standards from it. Even if the welfare state is institutionally anchored primarily in the member states, social justice must not stop at national borders.
We want to build a fair Europe. The right Europe is a community that is financed on the basis of solidarity, without tax loopholes for the super-rich. A just Europe is a continent where everyone can live well - whether in the greater Milan area, in Lusatia or in rural Romania. A fair Europe offers access to fairly paid work and public services, good education and unspoiled nature.
In short, a just Europe is an area of opportunity and solidarity. It combats social exclusion and discrimination. It promotes social justice, equality for women, inclusion, cohesion between generations, families, protection of children's rights and respect for human rights.
This is how it is laid out in the founding process of the EU. We are fighting for this justice. We want to be this Europe.
1. 
Good work and social security
Achieving fair wages
Good work with fair and reliable working conditions and effective co-determination provides security and support, especially in times of economic upheaval. Too many people in Europe have suffered from noticeable real wage losses and rising living costs in recent years. Those who can live reliably from their work and actively shape their workplace can also get involved in changes.
This also strengthens democracy. We want to shape good standards throughout Europe and prevent precarious employment and exploitation. A strong social partnership and a wide range of collective agreements are important foundations for good work.
One concrete success of social Europe is the Minimum Wage Directive. It protects the value and dignity of work and helps to ensure that many millions of employees in Europe will have a higher income in future - as the German government has also demonstrated on our initiative with the significant increase in the statutory minimum wage. The directive obliges member states to set appropriate minimum wages according to clear criteria and to demonstrate that effective measures have been taken. We want the Minimum Wage Directive to be consistently implemented in Germany and the EU recommendation to link the minimum wage to 60 percent of the median wage to be made binding. This would significantly increase the statutory minimum wage in Germany and other member states and continue to provide effective minimum protection for employees in the future. In addition, the directive is intended to strengthen the binding nature of collective bargaining: Member States with collective bargaining coverage of less than 80 percent must submit an action plan. We will also implement this in Germany and thus strengthen fairness in the middle of society. Because in this country, the scope of collective agreements is
has fallen sharply in recent decades. Effective monitoring is needed to ensure that the minimum wage directive actually takes effect in all member states. In this way, Europe can take concrete action against dumping wages so that work always pays and security is guaranteed in retirement.
We want to expand democracy and co- determination in the workplace across all countries. To this end, we want to strengthen the European Works Councils by working alongside the trade unions to call on the EU Commission to finally revise the existing directive on European Works Councils and put an end to exemptions. We want to improve legal certainty, legal access and enforcement options for European works councils. In order to close loopholes, franchise companies should also be included in the directive. We are also committed to increasing the representation of women, young employees and trainees in European Works Councils. Secondly, we are committed to reviewing the Societas Europaea Participation Act (SEBG) with regard to the representation of employees on the Supervisory Board. In particular the
We are focusing on the "before and after
principle": When a company is converted into a European Company, the existing level of co- determination must no longer be frozen.
In order to strengthen employee participation throughout the EU, we are campaigning for a new framework directive on the information, consultation and participation of employees that is tailored to the various European forms of company.
We are also fighting f o r modern occupational health and safety in Europe - in a rapidly accelerating digital working world, which for many employees is associated with constant availability, work intensification and stress. We therefore want to
a d v a n c e the protection of employees from mental and physical stress. In this way, we also strengthen the self-determination and potential of older employees. We are also committed to the comprehensive participation of people with disabilities and an i n c l u s i v e labor market.
Across Europe, too many people are still involuntarily out of work. To stabilize the labour market and the economy, we are strengthening the right to work through government support and investment. In the regions undergoing structural change in particular, we are committed to ensuring that employees within the region have the same level of subsequent employment. The transformation of these regions will only succeed with reliable offers for further training and placement.
Empowering employees in the digital world of work
New technologies offer great opportunities: new business areas and models create new jobs, digitalized processes bring productivity gains and work becomes more flexible, for example through home office arrangements. This change must not have a detrimental effect on women's participation in the world of work. Exploitation must not be a business model in the digital world of work either. That is why we are committed to strong rights for employees in the digital age. Collaboration in the digital labor market, for example in content moderation, should not reinforce colonial continuities.
Across the EU, around 28 million people work for companies that offer and combine digital services, known as platform companies. These companies benefit from the bogus self-employment model, which is widespread in the EU. The EU Commission estimates that 4 million workers in platform companies are bogus self-employed. In the ongoing European legislation on working conditions on digital platforms, we are committed to putting a stop to bogus self-employment, which leads to poor working conditions and inadequate social protection, across Europe. Fair working conditions should also apply in the gig economy.
We also need better ways of enforcing the rules. To this end, we want to strengthen labor inspections, among other things.
Many companies use software to automatically assign tasks and organize work.
The aim is to end the constant monitoring, loss of personal planning security in everyday life and the excessive work pressure that can accompany its use. We want to put an end to the constant monitoring, the loss of personal planning security in everyday life and the excessive work pressure that can accompany its use. In order to strengthen workers' rights and prevent abuse, we are campaigning for a new EU directive on algorithmic management in the workplace.the advances in the development of artificial intelligence offer great potential for workers. We want to use this to create good jobs and fair working conditions, as assistance systems can reduce the workload. The broad participation of the workforce is a key factor for the acceptance and successful introduction of such systems. We take into account employees' concerns about job losses. We are committed to ensuring that companies offer their employees the opportunity to prepare for this development through training and further education at an early stage. This gives them security and the opportunity to help shape change.
Making freedom of movement easier
The fact that EU citizens can work and live in any member state is a fundamental principle of the EU. This opens up enormous freedoms and promotes equal opportunities for everyone in the EU. At times, it also presents workers with new challenges for which European answers must be found. To ensure that the model of cross-border living and working works for employees in everyday life, we are committed to better coordination of national social security systems.
It is a great achievement that EU citizens can take social security entitlements that they have acquired in another EU country with them across borders (portability). However, the reality does not always live up to this promise: The differences between national social security systems, as well as the bureaucracy, make handling complicated, and gaps in benefits are not always filled.
benefits leave some behind. We therefore want more coordination between the national social insurance systems to make it easier to transfer social benefit entitlements from one country to another and to reduce the existing gaps, especially for cross-border commuters. We want to achieve this by ensuring the unbureaucratic exchange of information between the relevant social security systems and using the advantages of digitalization to do so.
Long-term care, for example for the elderly or people with chronic illnesses or disabilities, should also be covered in this way. A European Social Security Passport (ESSPASS) is a contribution to this. It should improve the transferability of entitlements across borders and reduce bureaucracy through digital verification. We also want to replace the so- called A1 certificate with a digital real-time register in order to prevent cross-border labor exploitation and ensure effective social protection.
Working from home was part of everyday life for many employees during the corona crisis and has been appreciated by more and more employees since then. We support these developments where it is practicable to do so. We also want mobile working not to stop at European borders, but to be possible in principle from a country other than the country of employment. We are therefore committed to ensuring that there is a guideline for working from home that makes it easier to work from home throughout the EU.
Fighting exploitation
For freedom of movement to work for all workers, effective protection against exploitation is also essential. Regardless of whether a worker from Austria is working in France or a seasonal worker from Georgia in Romania: EU citizens and people from third countries need comprehensive protection against discrimination and exploitation when they work in another EU country.
This is clearly demonstrated by the scandals in the meat industry, 24-hour care, truck drivers, seasonal workers and the construction industry. We are declaring war on these forms of exploitation.
Workers in these sectors often live and work in more than one place in the EU. They therefore make a substantial contribution to a functioning internal market and to maintaining our social systems, but are exposed to additional risks. We want to use European levers to combat bogus self- employment and wage and social dumping in these areas.
Regular labor inspections can also be an effective tool, for which the member states should increase staff and improve training in European legislation and cross-border issues. The protection of employees should be the top priority, and better cooperation between the national authorities and the European Labor Authority (ELA) is also necessary. This also includes suitable offers for advice and participation. The ELA's mandate should be extended to third-country nationals.
We welcome closer cooperation between the ELA and the trade unions. It should also be given a stronger role for joint coordinated inspections.
We want to take further measures to prevent abusive practices by subcontractors, such as enshrining joint and several liability in law. Time and again, workers are housed in catastrophic conditions, in overcrowded rooms, in poor hygienic conditions and with overpriced rent that is deducted directly from their wages. We therefore want to legally secure and effectively enforce the obligation to provide adequate accommodation.
An effective fight against labor exploitation begins with ensuring that those affected can inform themselves easily and in their own language about their rights - and receive help to enforce them. We are committed to long-term and reliable funding for the creation and Europe-wide networking of appropriate advice centers.
and support structures. With their technical expertise, trade unions are valuable partners in the development and implementation of such offers.
We welcome the fact that European payments in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy will in future be made dependent on compliance with labor standards in agriculture. This so-called social conditionality must now be implemented effectively.
Reducing child poverty
One in four children in Europe is at risk of poverty and social exclusion - that equates to almost 20 million children who have very limited access to healthy food, sport, education and culture. Child poverty means, on the one hand, existential deprivation in the here and now and, on the other, fewer opportunities for a self-determined and successful life in the future. We want all children to have access to a well-developed care and social infrastructure. Their future and the promotion of their potential will determine our future as a society. The European Child Guarantee is intended to ensure that every child at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Europe has access to free healthcare, early childhood care, education and upbringing, adequate housing and a healthy diet.
This is particularly important for children who
currently have poor opportunities. We want to ensure that the Child Guarantee is implemented throughout Europe with concrete measures.
In implementing the Child Guarantee in Germany, we are also actively involving civil society as well as children and young people. With the Child Guarantee, the federal government has launched a key instrument in the fight against child poverty in Germany on our initiative. It is a necessary step towards ensuring that children at risk of poverty are better off, that poverty is no longer hidden and that parents can live a more carefree and anxiety-free life because they and their children are protected. We are committed to ensuring that the shift away from the parents' obligation to collect and towards the state's obligation to provide is implemented throughout Europe. In order to benefit more from each other
In order to learn from our experience, we promote Europe-wide exchange on how families can be better supported and how a good upbringing can be ensured for all children in Europe.
Strengthening children's rights
Children have independent rights. They have a right to participate and require our special protection and care. The welfare of the child must be given priority in all matters concerning children. Particular attention must be paid to protecting children from violence and neglect. We want to further develop and consistently implement the EU child rights strategy. We want to promote European research and practical projects in the field of child protection and children's rights in order to make national experiences, practices and models usable for the further development of child protection everywhere.
Anchoring minimum social standards
Over 95 million people in the EU are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The high cost of living has exacerbated people's social situation, in some cases to an existential level. We want everyone in Europe to be able to rely on strong social systems that protect them from poverty. To achieve this, the welfare states of the member states need binding minimum standards.
We want to develop the existing European recommendation for adequate minimum security systems into a binding directive and link the standards set out therein with an individual entitlement to social rights for those affected in the member states. As part of this, all member states should gradually make their social systems poverty-proof in line with their respective levels of prosperity, promote sustainable integration into good work and expand the social infrastructure. For Germany, too, this means a tailwind for a strong welfare state and more social justice.
Making social security crisis-proof
The welfare state must prove its worth, especially in times of crisis. Better precautions against the economic and social consequences of external shocks must therefore be a key lesson from the crises of recent years. The fair participation of all citizens makes an important contribution to this. The social systems of the member states must be made crisis-proof and enable fast and effective protection for people in emergency situations.
However, crisis-induced mass unemployment with high social costs and hardship is overwhelming many EU member states. Its consequences destabilize the entire EU. The European crisis instrument SURE provided member states with financial loans and guarantees during the coronavirus pandemic in order to create jobs through the use of
of short-time working benefits - a great success. The instrument saved an estimated 1.5 million jobs in Europe in 2020 alone. Building on this experience, we want to createa permanent crisis instrument in the form of unemployment reinsurance for the member states, which will support national unemployment insurance schemes.
In times of multiple crises, young adults need perspectives that encourage them and a system that supports them in an emergency. This is why we are continuing to focus on European youth unemployment. The European Youth Guarantee is a way of opening up career prospects for young people and integrating them into the labor market as skilled workers. We welcome its strengthening in the context of the corona pandemic and continue to advocate for its continuation. In particular, we want t o further develop the standards of the training and qualification offers. With good advice and training, every young adult in Europe has the chance to learn a trade.
Making housing affordable
Housing is one of the central social issues of our time. For us, housing is a fundamental right
and must be secured as part of services of general interest. We want secure housing for all people. Affordable housing is particularly scarce in cities, with rising rents in many places and a declining stock of social housing putting a strain on tenants right up to the middle of society and leading to displacement and insecurity. In major European cities, a particularly large amount of living space is being used for short-term rentals and thus withdrawn from the rental market.
Rising rents must not exacerbate social inequality and poverty risks, for example for older people. We want to quickly create more affordable housing and limit rising rents - for example with refurbishments of existing buildings and interior insulation, sustainable construction, a skilled labor offensive and improved investments via the European Investment Bank (EIB). We are combating the housing shortage with additional barrier-free and disabled-accessible housing.
Investors who are buying up large amounts of urban residential real estate and valuable building land across Europe are driving up property and rental prices in many places.
upwards. The Europe-wide concentration on a few investors in the housing market harms competition and people. We are committedto transparent business practices. We are scrutinizing the existing European regulations in order to better protect tenants in the member states from rising prices and to safeguard the quality of our housing. This also includes protecting households from index- linked rental contracts. In light of the rising cost of living, we want to cap existing index-linked rents and restrict new ones, and we want to initiate a land turnaround in Europe. We are committed to protecting the scarce resource of land in the EU from speculation. We welcome long-term rental and lease models by the public sector instead of short-term sales. We want to integrate the land and real estate market more closely into EU competition law. We want to make the valuation of real estate and land Europe-wide oriented towards the common good. To this end, we also want to tackle a change in international accounting standards so that CO2 emissions can be integrated across all sectors.
and other socio-ecological values can be included in the financial valuation.
Homelessness violates human dignity and is one of the most extreme forms of poverty. The EU has set itself the ambitious goal of ending homelessness by 2030 and has launched a European Platform to Combat Homelessness. We want to implement its measures quickly. The dialog between the member states must be further strengthened. The opportunity to learn from each other and to adapt proven concepts such as Housing First or social housing agencies across the board should be strengthened.
We are committed to more effective prevention, sufficient living space and more individual, humane and less bureaucratic services for the people affected. These should also provide better care for people with mental illnesses and addictions. We want to expand European funding for corresponding plans and projects.
2. Strong regions
Strengthening municipalities
The strength and attractiveness of the EU also lies in the diversity of its regions and municipalities.
They are the foundation of the EU. This is where people live, learn and work. Strong municipalities thrive in a strong Europe, which attaches particular importance to municipal needs and freedom of action. The principle of subsidiarity - i.e. making decisions as close to the people as possible - is the basis for a Europe that protects and enables. We want to strengthen this principle and ensure the ability to act locally by providing sufficient resources.
This also means that the EU should use its possibilities to provide support where municipalities reach their limits. The everyday lives of citizens take place in Europe's municipalities.
This is where people live and work, where children are looked after and volunteer work is carried out, where people come to cinemas, restaurants, parks or sports facilities.
together. Municipalities form the basis of our social coexistence and, with functioning basic services, also offer attractive locations for companies and employees from all over Europe. The implementation of competition rules must not lead to municipalities being forced to privatize public goods or being restricted in their municipal planning sovereignty. We therefore need good procurement and concession law that focuses on social and ecological criteria - and at the same time strengthens the decisions of the public sector. It promotes legal certainty and enables municipalities to opt for high-quality regional offers. In this way, local authorities themselves can strengthen the added value of public infrastructure. They should also retain the ability to control and limit the use of space in order to ensure a supply close to where people live. By enabling the remunicipalization of past privatisations in the EU, we are creating new scope for local decision-making and reliable services of general interest. We continue to support local authorities in pursuing this path. An EU that defends the municipal scope for action
and expands, ensures quality of life and social
cohesion.
In particular, access to clean and affordable drinking water is an existential basis for a healthy life. Thanks to the success of the Right2Water citizens' initiative, Europe guarantees the highest standards for drinking water worldwide. The supply of drinking water should remain in municipal hands and not be determined by purely market-based economic interests. We therefore defend the exemption of water supply from the Concessions Directive and protect the right to drinking water in the EU.
Europe must be lived on the ground. Municipalities, regions, companies and civil society need a greater say in shaping European policy. That is why we want to strengthen the European Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. Cross- border European cooperation, such as town twinning or
Initiatives to strengthen cross-border regional competitiveness and connectivity (INTERREG programs) strengthen municipalities and regions, as do knowledge transfer and networking programs (e.g. Climate- ADAPT). We want to strengthen these programs. The level of the European regions (Euregios and Eurodistricts) should be made less bureaucratic and more flexible. They contribute with cross-border programs such as advisory services.
We are committed to simplifying the everyday lives of cross-border commuters and binational families by reducing bureaucracy and harmonizing administrative services and processes.
Promoting local cohesion
The success of the Green Deal and the cohesion of the EU will be decided on the ground: on the basis of concrete projects in the European regions. This is where important expertise for shaping change on the ground lies. An efficient funding policy in the EU involves local people and is geared towards the opportunities and challenges of digital and ecological change. We focus on the economic and social convergence of the regions in Europe. The size of the funds and funding programs should be geared towards the challenges.
So far, European regions have been prepared to varying degrees for these challenges. This applies both within and between the European member states. A consistent funding policy based on clear criteria will help to overcome these challenges.
to be both a driving force and a compass. We want to focus on structurally weak and rural regions as well as regions with an industrial character and modernization challenges in order to create equal living conditions for all people.
Demographic change poses a major challenge, particularly in structurally weak regions.
tion. The exodus of skilled workers, especially young people and women, is leading these regions into a spiral of hopelessness.
The EU must counteract this with better support for structurally weak regions. In this way, we strengthen the local shapers of the future and create good prospects for the regions.
Major challenges require a major effort and at the same time efficiency and precision in the use of funds. We ensure this by aligning funding with criteria in line with the European Green Deal. The European Social Fund (ESF+) plays an important role in this. It is also used by us to advise, support and provide lifelong training for numerous founders, employees and jobseekers. The promotion of long-term
projects should not be held up by delays in EU consultations. We are providing the ESF+ with sufficient funds to promote active employment policy and increased social participation, among other things. We are committed to ensuring that the administration of funds is simplified, that the conditions of good work play a major role and that the funds become drivers for a fair EU. A strong commitment to collective wage agreements, good employment and health protection and a wide range of opportunities for training and further education will turn attractive jobs into a locational advantage for the funded regions.
European funding offers a great opportunity to develop innovative projects. However, the programs are often not sufficiently well known and the application for funding and the implementation of the funding are often too complicated. This reduces the number of applications. Some good projects and ideas are not realized. We are changing this by working to simplify access to funding, increase awareness and accelerate the implementation of projects. To simplify the structures, we are reviewing the current system of individual funds. In order to reduce bureaucratic hurdles, we want to introduce, among other things, more packages and funding opportunities that
exempt volunteer applicants from pre-financing after project approval. Reducing bureaucracy thus creates more efficiency.
Every important change requires the participation of local citizens and civil society. A policy of being heard makes use of local expertise and creates mutual understanding.
This knowledge can be incorporated through the partnership for citizen participation (partnership principle). Mechanisms such as citizen dialogues, public consultations or forums should be part of the processes for allocating funds in all member states. Digital and hybrid formats should enable family-friendly participation. This is how we ensure co-determination and democratize the EU's funding policy.
Seizing opportunities in rural areas
Rural areas are spaces of future and opportunity. Their development is a central goal for us. It has a significant impact on cohesion in the EU. The transport transition can bring rural areas closer together, while the energy transition can create new added value and financially strengthen municipalities. Coworking spaces can revitalize town centers. We are also focusing on the rural outskirts of cities with their considerable development potential. Local people should be able to participate in decision-making and benefit from it. To do this, they need reliable services of general interest and places where they can meet and exchange ideas.
We want to strengthen services of general interest by supporting citizens' cooperatives and multifunctional facilities that, for example, carry out intergenerational projects with young and older people. In order to
To achieve this, we want to further strengthen funding approaches such as LEADER to support rural regions and the multi-fund approach in structural policy. Support for rural areas via the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) should be better dovetailed and expanded with the so-called cohesion funds and thus make a better contribution to the structural development of rural areas.
creates additional added value here. To this end, it should be fed into the electricity grid and used in a decentralized manner. We want to secure the necessary land, but minimize land consumption and consistently consider multiple uses, for example through agri-photovoltaic systems, biodiversity photovoltaics or more renewable electricity generation on sealed surfaces. We will continue to drive forward the expansion of renewables and support the modernization of the economy and society through the targeted use of subsidies in a way that benefits local people.
Regional agricultural value chains and near-natural forest management continue to be important economic factors and are characteristic of these areas.
Modernizing public procurement law
A genuine infrastructure union, a strong European market and the implementation of the Green Deal throughout the EU go hand in hand with massive investment in a secure future, at both national and European level. With public procurement law based on social and sustainable criteria, these investments will once again become the driving force for a fair and future-proof EU. We can make a big difference, especially where we invest in stable European infrastructure, efficient electricity grids, a reliable rail network or a people-oriented healthcare system. Boosting the European infrastructure union has positive effects on the European labor market: new jobs are being created in these sectors in particular. These jobs should also begood jobs. Strong public procurement law secures the future of many workers throughout the EU.
The state itself is a major economic player. We want to use this huge lever. Whether services or goods: Public procurement in the EU should be consistently sustainable and oriented towards the common good. We therefore want to modernize the Public Procurement Directive and align it with sustainability and public interest criteria. This also favors the awarding of contracts to small and medium-sized enterprises and thus strengthens regional value creation.
An intact public space and the fulfillment of public tasks are the basis of our social coexistence. We want the EU to take measures so that tasks can not only be put out to tender, but also awarded.
Transparency, less bureaucracy, digitalization, acceleration and uncomplicated procedures remain our guiding principles. Necessary investments should not be unduly delayed. Every company should be able to bid for public contracts easily and successfully. Waste of money is minimized through a clear procurement policy.
Simple communication of the rules and active support for small and local providers, for example with references to the legal framework, ensure fairness. The awarding of public contracts thus becomes a competition for the best conditions.
3. Reliable healthcare
Overcoming health crises at European level
We want a Europe that works together to protect and promote the health of all people.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown once again that the major challenges facing our health know no national borders. It has also shown us that we can tackle them better together. The rapid development and availability of coronavirus vaccines, for example, was also a European success that came about thanks to many years of research, innovative companies and cross-border cooperation. During the pandemic, the EU has driven forward the joint procurement of protective equipment and vaccines, strengthened joint research activities, coordinated the free movement of people and goods during border closures and cushioned economic emergencies.
The competencies of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have also been expanded in order to facilitate the exchange of information.
with and between the member states and to recognize and overcome health crises at an earlier stage.
In order to better manage cross-border health crises and strengthen crisis preparedness, we want to work together even more closely at European and global level. The EU has an important role to play here in ordertoensurethat national measures
and supplement the measures taken. It can also exert an important influence globally. At international level, we are committed to strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) and multilateral health initiatives politically, financially and in terms of personnel, promoting the innovative power of European health research more strongly and improving global access to affordable medicines and healthcare services for all people, which is a question of solidarity, as health crises often hit the poorest hardest. But it is also in our own interests, because pandemics are global challenges. We are committed to the active transfer of technology and knowledge regarding the production of key medicines. Monopolies on intellectual property to combat diseases must not prevent access to vital protective materials, health technologies, vaccines and medicines. Where voluntary production partnerships are not sufficient, we support applications for the granting of mandatory licenses in return for compensation for these goods in health crises and pandemic situations and advocate for the temporary suspension of patents at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in these contexts. our goal is for all EU citizens to have health insurance. We therefore want better coordination of social security systems in the EU - including direct billing options between health insurance providers.
Strengthening preventionWe place prevention and health promotion at the heart of our health policy. This is how we can prevent diseases from developing in the first place. Good prevention structures, better information about the risks of illness and a healthy lifestyle are
important building blocks for a better quality of life and a longer life expectancy. In this way, we can also prevent diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. To make it easier for consumers toeat healthily, we want to provide reliable information about the ingredients in food. We want to prevent the development of tobacco and alcohol-related diseases as far as possible. This requires greater efforts to reduce risky forms of alcohol consumption and tobacco use, for example by reducing the nicotine content in tobacco and nicotine products. We are committed to the goals of the European Beating Cancer Plan. According to this plan, the proportion of smokers in the EU population should fall below 5 percent by 2040.
Gaps that still exist in advertising - for example on
social platforms and particularly in the area of sponsorship - must now be closed across the EU. The protection of minors also requires us to push ahead with advertising restrictions for alcohol, gambling and sports betting. In order to be able to better counter future health crises, we want to strengthen preventive health research in addition to research into the causes of diseases and new treatment methods.
The EU should work towards intensifying global cooperation in the area of the authorization and monitoring of medicinal products.
Learning lessons from the pandemic
Even if the most visible signs of the corona pandemic have disappeared with the lockdown restrictions or the mask requirement, many people are still suffering from the consequences of a Covid-19 infection (long/post-Covid) and quite a few from the much less common consequences of a Covid-19 vaccination (post-Vac). We therefore want to intensify research into infectious diseases such as Covid-19 and their sequelae (e.g. myocarditis or ME/CFS) at European level and make research funding available for this purpose. We also need more European exchange, for example through an EU network of experts.
Prevention is at the heart of everything we do. For people with illnesses and shadow families in particular, this is an important building block for equal participation in society. This also includes making healthy indoor air a matter of course.pandemics do not affect everyone equally. People on low incomes, those in precarious employment and people in large institutions are significantly more likely to be affected by Covid-
19. These groups must be given greater attention during the next pandemic.
Covid-19 is - alongside AIDS or Ebola, for example - another case of a so-called zoonosis, i.e. a disease that is transmitted from animals to humans. The corona pandemic thus underlines once again that human health should not be viewed in isolation, but is closely linked to the environment and animal health. This is why planetary health and the One Health approach are guiding principles for our health policy: sufficient space for animals and nature and a reduction in industrially farmed livestock help in the fight against zoonoses; fewer antibiotics in factory farming leads to less antibiotic resistance; clean air and fewer toxins in the environment save human lives.
In particular, we need an effective European early warning system against pandemics in order to be able to identify dangerous pathogens at an early stage and make information about them available in a transparent manner. At the same time, pandemic scenarios must be practised regularly, above all to ensure that a crisis and emergency organization can be set up quickly.
Focusing on mental health
War, inflation, climate crisis, pandemic - the past few years have been turbulent, conflict-ridden and characterized by crises and upheavals that have left no-one unscathed. For many people, this period is also a psychological burden. For many young people in particular, psychological problems have worsened. We set
We are committed to ensuring that mental health receives the attention it deserves and that those affected no longer have to suffer from stigmatization. We also want to achieve this with support from Europe. We are committed to both improved Europe-wide prevention and to improving existing approaches to mental health and better treatment of illnesses. To improve patient safety
In order to guarantee the quality of creative therapies, comparable legal regulations and protected professional designations are needed across Europe, such as for artistic therapies. We support research into creative therapy approaches and advocate the networking of experts in Europe and want to develop comprehensive solution strategies together with the member states, also in order to further strengthen community-based, human rights-based care, increase care security and avoid coercive measures. As the causes of mental health problems are manifold, we must also tackle them at all levels. That is why we are committed to ensuring that the impact on mental health is minimized.
health must be considered across the board in all relevant policy areas. This also applies to the effects of mental illness and neurodiversity. This requires greater awareness of the problem in the EU and its institutions. In this respect, we welcome the EU Commission's strategy for mental health and are committed to implementing it as quickly and comprehensively as possible.
More and more people in Europe are also experiencing loneliness. This is often a very stressful situation for those affected. Older people in particular are also affected. The pandemic has further exacerbated the situation for many people in this regard. With our policies, we are committed to greater social cohesion, inclusion, participation and integration.
Ensuring the supply of medicines
The challenges facing European healthcare systems are immense: ageing societies, an increasing number of chronic diseases and epidemics. The corona pandemic has
also made it clear that the EU is too dependent on manufacturers with unreliable supply chains for medicinal products and their active ingredients. and therefore often accepts production under poor working conditions and poor environmental standards. Vulnerable groups suffer particularly from drug shortages.
In order to address the major challenges facing the healthcare sector, the EU Commission has presented a legislative package to reform the pharmaceutical sector. We welcome the proposals, which aim to diversify supply chains and make them more sustainable, as well as to oblige pharmaceutical companies to better prevent drug shortages and report them earlier. Pharmacies also contribute to a reliable supply of medicines.
In order to encourage companies to develop and produce new medicines, active ingredients and medical devices in Europe, incentives and less bureaucratic procedures are needed. We have two priorities here: Firstly, critical medicines that are indispensable at all times, such as important antibiotics, must be reliably available through crisis-proof supply chains. The partial relocation of production back to Europe can contribute to this. On the other hand, new incentives for the development of medical innovations must be created for previously neglected diseases and in view of the emergence of therapy resistance.
This includes, in particular, new financing models such as adapted remuneration models for reserve antibiotics. Incentives for research and development and the protection of intellectual property must not jeopardize the affordability of essential medicines and disproportionately delay the market entry of generics. We are also committed to gender-sensitive research and medicine so that gaps in knowledge about gender- specific differences in diagnosis and treatment are closed and taken into account. Studies in the field of pediatric and adolescent medicine should also be intensified to ensure that access to safe and effective medicines is improved.
becomes. At the same time, greater consideration must be given to the diversity of people, especially in studies on new drugs and treatment methods.
It is far too opaque how prices for medicines are set. The lack of transparency and accountability in this area sometimes leads to immense price increases. Especially when public funds are used for drug development, this must generally be accompanied by transparency regarding the costs of research and development as well as pricing. In addition, publicly funded development projects should ensure that
resulting medicines are made sufficiently accessible in countries of the Global South.
Using health data securely
Digitalization in the healthcare sector has great advantages for patient healthcare and research. Diseases can be better diagnosed, the causes of diseases can be researched, unnecessary examinations can be avoided and the treatment of patients between different doctors and hospitals can be simplified across borders throughout Europe. The European Health Data Space should therefore enable EU-wide access to digital patient records.
We want to strengthen patients' rights through effective data protection, comprehensive IT security and personal access to the data stored about them. The
is fundamental to people's trust in the processing of health data. Fundamental transparency in data management and technical solutions such as a digital consent assistant can support this. After all, personal health information is some of the most sensitive and personal data of all.
and at the same time not to pass on any data against the patient's will, we rely on the possibility of objection (opt-out) and the focus on the protection of personal data in the case of pseudonymized health data.
good data quality. In this way, we want to increase the availability of data for public-benefit research and provide public authorities with better assessment options in emergency situations. This represents an important paradigm shift in the use of health data, which we want to shape. Access to and analysis of larger amounts of data promotes innovation potential and can therefore improve patient care. Traceability of data should be excluded as far as possible and violations of this should be prosecuted. Comprehensive protection against discrimination for all and, in particular, the needs of vulnerable groups must be taken into account in a comprehensive manner. standardized data formats and interfaces are fundamental to the success of digitalization in the healthcare sector in order to enable the consolidation of data and cross-border use in Europe. We therefore want to ensure the development and mandatory use of internationally used data standards and interoperable interfaces by the software systems right from the start.
Curbing antibiotic resistance
Antibiotics can save human lives. This should also be guaranteed in the future. Measures must therefore be taken to guarantee their long-term effectiveness. By using antibiotics responsibly, we want to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-resistant germs. After all, these are one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity.
Particularly in people with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, children or people with pre- existing conditions, they lead to the emergence of multi-resistant germs every year.
to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. It is therefore important that antibiotics and highly potent disinfectants are only used wherethey are really needed or where they are appropriate. We want to strengthen the prudent use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine and promote research. In addition, rapid diagnostic tests that check whether treatment with antibiotics is necessary before prescribing should be available in sufficient quantities.
We want to align the EU list of reserve antibiotics, which are reserved for human medicine and may not be used in industrial animal husbandry, with the corresponding WHO criteria. We also want to end the import of animal products in which antibiotics banned in the EU have been used. We want to reduce the entry of antibiotic residues into the environment through measures to improve hygiene and wastewater disposal. We want to promote the development of new antibiotics and effective alternative treatment methods through incentives.
Ensuring good care
A strong public and non-discriminatory healthcare system and needs-based care and assistance for older, sick and disabled people are essential to protect human dignity and promote self- determination. The shortage of nursing staff is becoming increasingly acute, both in the EU and here in Germany. We therefore want to increase the attractiveness of the nursing profession, facilitate the free movement of professionals within the EU in this area and improve the working conditions of nursing staff. Our aim is to simplify recognition procedures for degrees as well as for initial and further training for nursing professionals within the EU and from abroad. As part of the EU care strategy, we advocate competitive working conditions and salaries in professional care compared to other sectors. Appreciation also needs wages that reflect this - ideally through good collective agreements. In addition, more investment is needed in care facilities, especially in forms of housing and care that enable people to live independently in their own neighborhoods and living environments, care services and the training and further education of care professionals. We also want to promote greater EU involvement in research and model projects as well as a transfer of knowledge and experience to improve working conditions in health and care facilities in the member states.
In order to improve the situation of care workers in home care, we are calling for a revision of occupational health and safety legislation to ensure that employed care workers in private households are also included and have good working conditions. In the coming decades, there will be a further increase in the number of people in need of care and suffering from dementia. Our aim is to enable these people to lead a dignified, self-determined and active life.
In order to drive forward more innovations in the area of care and participation, we want to strengthen the European exchange on new approaches, for example on inclusive forms of housing and care, neighborhood-oriented support and personal assistance. We also want to provide better support and relief for family caregivers and loved ones. This is why we are working at a European level to ensure that family caregivers, the majority ofwhom are women, have good social security and do not fall into old-age poverty due to care responsibilities. Their skills acquired in care work should be recognized and access to further training should be promoted.
We also want to implement the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the care sector.
Legalize cannabis across Europe
We are also committed to a modern drug policy in Europe that prioritizes health and the protection of young people and effectively combats the criminal structures behind the drug trade. In Europe, too, the purely repressive approach to drugs has brought more suffering than blessings, thousands of drug-related deaths and an important source of income for organized crime. What is needed is a drug policy based on science and risk-based assessment. In various places around the world, the shift to a risk-based approach to cannabis has already been successful. With the regulation of cannabis, we are focusing on reason instead of criminalization. We are striving for EU-wide legalization and controlled dispensing of cannabis.
national law currently imposes strict limits on the member states when dealing with cannabis. We want to extend this so that each country can decide for itself. At the same time, we are strengthening prevention and the protection of minors.
The increase in problematic drug use, new and synthetic substances and the consequences of social impoverishment in public spaces pose a major challenge. They pose dangers for consumers, pose particular challenges for authorities and require social measures, and we must take more effective action against invisible and visible addiction problems. This is why we are intensifying cross-border cooperation in the interests of health protection. In addition, we want to
improve health care for addicts, turn away from repression in dealing with users, strengthen social support structures and improve access to treatment. We also want to further advance research into the use of psychoactive substances, in particular their medical benefits, in European research networks.
4. Education and opportunities
Networking Europe's universities better
The European Higher Education Area contributes to making higher education in Europe more comparable and internationally competitive and is invaluable for promoting academic mobility.
Europe's universities are an important part of the education system, a place for shaping the future, for critical self-reflection in society and for social and technological innovation. If we network them, we can make even better use of their diverse skills and profiles for the entire continent. We have therefore long been committed to establishing and strengthening European university networks. We promote the use of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in teaching and education. We want to shape these in such a way that teachers, students and pupils can use them independently and confidently.
The new applications must be designed in a socially fair and non-discriminatory way. Access to these new applications must be designed to be socially fair and non-discriminatory.
In line with the idea of a European degree, we support the further development of the European approach as part of the Bologna Process in order to facilitate the recognition of joint programmes and joint degrees and to create incentives for the internationalization of degree programmes.
Regardless of the country, students rarely have a lot of money at their disposal. Visits to museums, theaters, but also excursions to other cities, for example, open up new horizons. Many of these institutions offer discounts for students. But especially for students from other countries
It is often difficult for students to obtain these benefits with their home student ID cards. With the European Student Card (ESC) and the digital student card in the Erasmus+ app, the EU has already taken the first steps towards a European student card, but only for a very limited group of people. We want all students at European universities and higher education institutions to be able to obtain a (digital) European student card.
Recognizing professional qualifications throughout Europe
The opportunity to study or work in any European country opens up many new perspectives.
However, when it comes down to it, things often become difficult: we have created a comparable degree system in the EU with the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the Bologna Process. But it is not automatic, for example, that a Bachelor's degree from one country will be recognized for a Master's degree in another country. Students and graduates, including those in further vocational training, have to go through an often still very bureaucratic procedure in the respective country. In some cases, the domestic degree is then given less value.
In some cases, recognition is very costly. That is why we are committed to ensuring that vocational training qualifications and educational qualifications within the framework of the European Qualifications Framework are more easily and quickly recognized in every EU country instead of having to be laboriously recognized.
It is even more difficult with professional qualifications. Here, recognition is often complicated, lengthy and expensive. In times of skills shortages, this is particularly counterproductive. For a handful of professions, people can therefore apply for the European Professional Card (EPC) in their home country. This electronic procedure makes it easier to have a qualification in a regulated profession recognized in another EU country. We want to significantly increase the number of professions for which the EBA is possible. We want to improve the position of applicants by introducing comparable recognition procedures across Europe and offering comprehensive guidance and support through multilingual advice and information services.
Political education against disinformation
Our democracies and our values are under constant attack from authoritarian and anti- democratic movements at home and abroad. Their means: disinformation, fake news and manipulation of their distribution mechanisms as well as deliberate disruption and flooding of digital debate spaces. They are increasingly operating across borders and trying to undermine cohesion in the EU and our European values. Their conspiracy myths sow hatred and exclusion. We need to counter this more strongly and in a coordinated manner across Europe. We therefore want to establish a European Center for Civic Education, a point of contact for civic education that specifically addresses the European dimension of disinformation. It should primarily address young people and young adults, but at the same time be available to all citizens as a source of information and create a wide range of offers in the digital space. This European Center for Civic Education is also intended to
People in the EU candidate countries are open.
It can explain the European idea and complex European processes in a way that is appropriate for the target group. This center should also strengthen people's digital media literacy in times of disinformation and fake news. To this end, it can also promote the networking of European players in research and education. It should be able to work independently and according to clear scientific and ethical criteria.
In this way, we promote our democratic values and strengthen the fight against discrimination.
Get to know Europe with Erasmus
For many, Erasmus+ is their first and often most personal encounter with the EU. Erasmus+ promotes a living European community and facilitates academic and professional exchange.
Student exchanges are at the heart of the program: we want more people to be able to have these experiences, especially those from families who lack the money for vacations or exchange time abroad. This means thatwe need to increase financial support for stays abroad. We are therefore campaigning for an increase in Erasmus funding. For many people, leaving home to go abroad is a big step and the prospect of not being able to afford to visit family during this time is a barrier. That's why we want to introduce a mobility ticket for Erasmus participants, which would allow them to travel to and from their place of residence once every semester free of charge, for example. To make it easier to integrate semesters abroad into the curriculum, we are striving to harmonize semester times.
We want people with disabilities to be able to opt for a valuable Erasmus+ experience. That is why we want to expand the advisory services (e.g. information on national contact points for assistance) before and during the project implementation and make information available without barriers
and ensure that the additional costs are covered. We want to work with the UK to find ways in which people on both sides can benefit from exchanges again after Brexit.
Many students are familiar with Erasmus+. However, trainees are not yet sufficiently familiar with the program. We want to change that. After all, it offers many opportunities to learn new professional skills and gain new experiences. We want to strengthen Erasmus+ for trainees with better information, more advice and simpler applications and recognition.
We want to enable as many trainees as possible to participate in the Erasmus+ program by offering support to small craft businesses.
Erasmus+ is one of Europe's success stories, including for youth work. With a view to the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework from 2028, we will work to double the funding for Erasmus+.
5. Europe's youth
Involving young people
Europe thrives on community, encounters, tolerance and mutual understanding. To make this possible, European and international youth work plays an extraordinary role. It enables young people to think outsidethe box and make friends across Europe. Youth associations and youth groups are the basis for the leisure and educational activities of millions of young people in Europe. In our civil society, we must ensure that the voluntary commitment of young people is valued and that youth work does not fall victim to bureaucratic hurdles. We are therefore in favor of strengthening and simplifying project funding via Erasmus+. We want to make Europe more tangible and easier to experience, especially for young people in our eastern neighboring countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic. We want to strengthen European youth work and focus on Eastern Europe.
Many people talk about young people and their needs. We want them to have their say and have a say in the Europe in which they live. They are currently massively underrepresented in the political arena. That is why it is good that young people in Germany aged 16 and over can now vote in the European elections for the first time. We are committed to ensuring that this becomes a
r e a l i t y a t a l l levels in all member states and in Germany.
Beyond the right to vote, we also want to further strengthen youth participation in Europe in structural terms. Through the EU Youth Dialogue, the EU has created a direct channel for the participation of young people and youth associations at European level. This is to be further strengthened and integrated into other participation formats. The results of these consultations should be incorporated even more strongly into the work of the EU Commission in future and young people and their representatives should be regularly consulted in future.
be heard in the European Parliament. We also support the EU Youth Check, which aims to review the impact of EU decisions on young people. The EU Youth Strategy sets out the guidelines for European youth policy. We want ensure that the further development of the EU Youth Strategy strengthens the interests of young people in all policy areas. To this end, existing participation formats for young people must be sensibly linked, structurally safeguarded and their connection to national participation structures ensured, and we are also committed to upgrading the position of EU Youth Coordinator.
Expanding voluntary services
A community is only as strong as the commitment of its members. Civil society has a special role to play here. The commitment of young Europeans in particular is fundamental - for example in refugee aid, projects to promote democracy, climate protection or social justice.
That is why we want to create one million places in the European Voluntary Service, especially for young people from low-income families. We must ensure better framework conditions for them, such as appropriate compensation, so that volunteering is something that everyone can afford. However, voluntary services also need clubs, associations and organizations to offer them. We want to strengthen these, as they create places of democracy and civic engagement. With a Voluntary Ecological Year (FÖJ or EYE - European Year for Ecology), we enable young people aged 18 and over to engage in an intercultural European exchange in the field of nature conservation and thus create the opportunity to stand up for Europe's nature.
Through the FÖJ, we want to motivate young
people to prepare and qualify for jobs in the climate and environmental sector.
We don't just want to offer this idea to young people. We also want to harness the experience, knowledge and commitment of senior citizens throughout Europe: Many of them have knowledge that they still want to use when they retire. With a European program, we want to provide the framework for senior citizens to participate in projects throughout the EU.
can work in training, placement or civil society.
Discover Europe
With the DiscoverEU program, 18-year-olds can experience the EU first-hand. Twice a year, so- called travel passes are raffled off among young people, allowing them to travel through Europe by train for 30 days during a specific period.
Together with other young people from different countries, they can discover just how diverse Europe is. This is why we support the DiscoverEU program and want to expand it in the future. Our aim is to create more shared experiences from many parallel journeys. We want to make the program better known, especially among young people from less affluent backgrounds. We also want to create incentives for
Groups from several European countries traveling together.
6. For an age-friendly Europe
The average age of people in Europe is the highest of any region in the world, and the trend is rising. We want demographic change to be seen as a challenge and an opportunity for us all. The knowledge, life experience and activity of Europe's older citizens can be an important factor for the cohesion of society. Thousands of elderly volunteers prove this every day: older people are discriminated against or excluded in many contexts, but this is often not immediately recognizable as such. That is why we want to better protect older people throughout Europe from discrimination in the workplace and in everyday life and create equal opportunities.
Accessibility in the world of work and in public spaces is important, and we want as many municipalities and regions in Europe as possible to join the global network of age-friendly cities and municipalities.
"Age-friendly cities and communities" of the WHO. Age-friendly cities and communities are also child-, family- and disability-friendly, and one of the network's aims is to enable people to age healthily, safely and independently in their living environment. People in old age and with increasing age-related limitations should also be able to remain in their own four walls, including barrier- free public transport networks and housing construction as well as heat protection measures for the elderly. We also advocate for more public places and opportunities that are designed in such a way that the generations can meet, interact and learn from each other in everyday life. In order to improve the situation of older people internationally, we will campaign for a UN convention on the rights of older people.
Everyone in Europe should have the opportunity to learn any other European language free of charge and without discrimination. For this
we want to advocate the creation of a European language learning app that can be used to learn any other European language. This is how we strengthen European identity.
7. Consumer protection
Understanding consumer protection as a locational advantage
The legal protection of consumers makes the EU a union of strong citizens. The freedoms for goods, capital, services and people in the European single market are among the EU's greatest locational advantages.
Consumer protection provides far-reaching safeguards for consumption, health and freedoms, making the EU a global pioneer: fee-free roaming, a user-friendly electricity market, modern infrastructure and safe and durable consumer goods are just a few examples.
And it works: a uniform charging cable for mobile devices, for example, promises to put an end to the tangle of cables in countless drawers. The binding European standard strengthens the European circular economy, reduces electronic waste and makes consumers' lives noticeably easier. We want to cover the entire spectrum of digital devices such as smartwatches, e-readers and headphones and also include wireless charging technologies.
Binding eco-design, i.e. production according to criteria of durability, reparability and ecological compatibility, provides consumers with better products. We are committed to the rapid implementation of the directives so that relevant product groups such as toys, furniture and clothing are covered in a timely manner.
If a product does break down, the European right to repair promises consumers long-term access to spare parts and repair instructions. A broken smartphone battery, printer or vacuum cleaner does not necessarily mean a new purchase. The lifespan of expensive or cherished purchases
is extended considerably with the right to repair. This means that durable and repairable products will be easier on people's wallets.
Update cycles and expiring update periods must be based on comprehensible and rational criteria. It is not in the interests of consumers if they are forced to buy new devices due to short update periods. This
We want to put a stop to "planned obsolescence" in the hardware and software sector.
Being able to use everyday products safely is becoming a matter of course with the EU. From food and clothing to cosmetics, toys and simple everyday items, safety comes first. Harmful substances, nanoparticles and residues of semi- metals or heavy metals that are harmful to health are found in many of these consumer and consumer goods. To ensure safety and transparency, we are expanding risk research and creating a register for nanoparticles.
We also want to shape the design of the European electricity market in the interests of consumers so that the price advantages of renewable energies are widely available. With transparent infrastructure costs that are as low as possible, the decoupling of the consumption price of renewable electricity from the rising costs of emissions trading and intelligent load management, the advantage of low-cost electricity generation remains with them.we protect electricity consumers from high costs by supplementing the promotion of renewable energies with a cap on revenues. We also strengthen consumer participation by enabling time-flexible electricity tariffs and simplified prosu- ming. This makes it easy to integrate heat pumps or wall boxes for electric cars into the electricity market, for example, and we are paying particular attention to protecting consumers in the area of medical products and aids. The plight of particularly vulnerable consumers is often exploited. Above all, we want to protect older people, carers and people with disabilities from unsuitable or overpriced products and give them access to individually tailored aids.
In order to combat the addictive mechanisms of betting, gambling and games on the Internet, which seek to entice users to wager more and more money, we will make it easier to identify mechanics with addictive potential and take greater account of them in age classifications across Europe.
Guarantee passenger rights
Freedom of travel in the EU should be comfortable and safe for all citizens. Passengers should be protected in their rights when traveling through Europe - whether by bus, train or plane. This is another reason why we want to use a cross- provider ticketing system to enable booking platforms to offer consistent tickets across borders, making traveling by train more attractive and significantly reducing planning costs. Meeting the needs of people with disabilities
We are committed to the comprehensive protection of passenger rights. Compensation for train delays should be increased to 50 percent of the ticket price after 60 minutes and 75 percent after 90 minutes, as called for by the European Parliament. In terms of the right to barrier-free mobility, we advocate the assumption of costs for alternative transportation options if the promised accessibility has not been met.
In addition, the rights of EU citizens, especially cross- border workers, should also apply to companies with different regional operations. We are committed to uniform minimum standards in local and regional transport. These should also apply to discounted tickets and interrupted travel chains.
Anyone who decides to travel by air should also arrive at their destination safely and on time. The amendment of air passenger rights is intended to close the existing gaps in consumer protection for air travel and further expand rights. We are strengthening consumers' entitlement to compensation in the event of delays or postponements of air travel. Travelers' claims should be
be included in the regulation in the event of a long delay of three hours or more. If flights are postponed, the deadline for informing travelers should be extended to four weeks before the start of the trip. References to the claim
on compensation should be placed prominently throughout.
Especially for travelers who only fly occasionally and families, the regulations for taking baggage with them are often intransparent and complicated. We are committed to a standardized regulation for the dimensions of carry-on baggage and transparent pricing for all baggage variants.
Cancellations must not be at the expense of passengers. That is why we want all airlines to have to insure themselves against insolvency.
Protect yourself from cost traps
should be the termination. Consumers often find it impossible to terminate contracts concluded online or have no certainty about the receipt and legal security of the termination. Being tied to unwanted or no longer needed contracts quickly becomes a cost trap. For long-term contracts that can be concluded online, we want to introduce an easily accessible termination button on the company's website. In this way, we will ensure a high level of consumer protection throughout Europe, following the German model. This will make the Europe-wide use of services simpler and safer. The burden of proof for proper implementation should lie with the companies. If this is not legally secure, this will not be to the detriment of consumers: Contracts should then be able to be terminated at any time without notice. We are committed to supplementing the relevant consumer directive and thus giving customers back control over their contracts.
Concluding contracts online has long been part of everyday life for many people and makes things much easier. Just as uncomplicated as concluding
 What protects peace 
The Russian war of aggression against our European neighbor Ukraine has shown that peace, freedom, security and human rights cannot be taken for granted: Peace and freedom, security and human rights cannot be taken for granted. They must be defended and strengthened again and again. Moscow has challenged the European Union (EU) peace project. We support our Ukrainian friends who are facing up to this challenge with all their strength - and are standing firm together.
But tensions are also increasing worldwide beyond Ukraine. China is becoming increasingly authoritarian, threatening its neighbors and challenging the rule-based international order.
China's competition with democracies around the world also poses significant challenges to our lives and economies. In Africa, Asia and South America, states and societies are calling for
meanwhile rightly demand more representation, a fair say and an equal seat at the negotiating table.
These shifts in the global power structure are challenging the EU. Together with the consequences of the pandemic, inflation, sovereign debt and climate crisis, they once again make it clear that we must join our democratic forces to protect peace in Europe and make a strong European contribution to the security of Europe and the world.
Together we are capable of acting. The EU has proven time and again how capable it is of working internationally for peace, security, the rule of law and sustainable development. It has proven this: Peace can be learned, stabilized and shaped for the benefit of all. The
gives hope in difficult times: An EU that acts confidently and constructively on the world stage and speaks with one voice is able to assert itself against unfreedom and war, defend our interests and values, fend off external influence, shape the future and peace - and noticeably improve people's lives. This Europe offers prospects for political and sustainable economic development worldwide - and thus an urgently needed counter- offer to the influence of China and Russia in particular.
That is our perspective, that is our political mission: the EU's global capacity to act
to defend and strengthen it. When many were still "Change through trade", the Greens have warned that autocratic regimes such as Russia act against the interests of their own citizens in orderto enforce their imperial goals by force. We therefore advocate a sovereign and self-confident Europe that does not wait and see, but takes the reins of action into its own hands; a Europe that frees itself from its dependencies and assumes global responsibility.
An EU that is capable of action and stands on its own two feet is the best protection against all those forces that conjure up isolation and exclusion, both within and outside the European alliance. Above all, the EU can effectively assert its interests if it also places its values at the center - the often claimed contradiction is not one.
Peace and freedom do not come from isolationism, but from values-based and fair dealings with our partners. The most important forum for this is the United Nations (UN) and its organizations, which we want to strengthen and make fairer and more representative. They are the best way to achieve multilateralism in which the strength of the law prevails, not the law of the strongest.
In these challenging times, the EU must actively seek all opportunities for international cooperation and use all channels of cooperation in order to preserve peace, realize human rights, strengthen democratic forces and promote the rule of law.
to prevent conflicts and promote prosperity. In addition to strengthening the relationship with In addition to its allies in the transatlantic and trans-Pacific region, the EU must actively seek partnerships with countries of the Global South.
We want to promote global justice in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. In doing so, we pay attention to the coherence of our political action across all policy areas such as economic and trade policy.
Often enough, however, women in particular are not at the table during negotiations. This makes it more difficult to develop fair and viable solutions. Societies are demonstrably more peaceful and prosperous when all people can participate in political, social and economic life. Peace and security are more sustainable when women are involved.
That is why we
We are actively committed to ensuring that women in particular are represented comprehensively and equally in foreign policy.
The most existential challenge facing humanity, the climate and environmental crisis, can only be tackled globally. Europe and the other industrialized countries have a special historical and dual responsibility due to their decades of emissions: in their own interest, they must quickly become climate-neutral themselves and at the same time support poorer countries in partnership on their path to climate-neutral and climate- adapted prosperity. This is why we are placing climate diplomacy at the center of our plan for a European foreign policy and thus paving the way for resilient partnerships - partnerships that create win-win situations and benefit both the people in our partner countries and help to secure our supply of renewable energy and raw materials. A strong European external climate policy also means that the EU must play a pioneering role in the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and, together with the private sector, make a decisive contribution to the necessary investments for climate-friendly development worldwide. In the same way, Europe must tackle the global biodiversity crisis: pursue ambitious goals itself, finance
and support the countries of the Global South in implementing their goals.
If the worst comes to the worst, we must be able to defend our peace in the alliance militarily. The use of military force remains the last resort for us. For the EU's ability to defend itself, overall national and societal resilience is also indispensable. To this end, it is essential to be able to withstand shocks and disruptions in the sense of a comprehensive concept of security. This includes increasing cyber security and the fight against disinformation, strengthening infrastructures as well as state and economic supply structures and strengthening civil protection. This can
We can do this better, more efficiently and more effectively if we coordinate our security policy at European level and exchange information faster and better. We want a comprehensive approach to European foreign policy that focuses on human security, focuses on the prevention and civilian management of crises and conflicts and actively seeks opportunities for de-escalation.
Those who contribute to maintaining peace prevent the need to create peace - this is how Europe protects itself. The commitment to a culture of non-violence, military restraint and a world without war is an important cross-cutting task that encompasses far more than the area of foreign policy. We think security in terms of each individual person, whose dignity and freedom are at the heart of our policy. This understanding of a precautionary and values-based security policy is part of the European promise.
Its weight, in turn, is most evident where there is invitation and hope. The aspirations of many Ukrainians to assert their freedom and become part of the European family may have been met with brutal armed force by Vladimir Putin. But it lives on and proves the power of the European project beyond its own borders. The idea of a common European home was linked to the wish that people from different nations could live together peacefully under one roof.
It is precisely this wish that Russia has clearly rejected with its war of aggression against Ukraine in violation of international law and against Ukraine's right to self-determination. Nevertheless, we are sticking to this wish. We are committedto the start of Ukraine's accession process - and at the same time see it as recognition of the immeasurable work that the country does every day for the security of us all and for European values.
The Europe we want to shape does exactly that. It protects and defends its own values. It asserts itself - and at the same time confidently reaches out to others. We want to work on this Europe.
This is the Europe we want to be.
1. A European foreign policy
Acting together on foreign policy
We need a strong and sovereign EU that can act as a global political player. So far, however, EU foreign policy still requires the approval of all 27 member states. We advocate an expansion of majority decisions in the Council that takes into account the interests of both the larger and smaller member states. In order to achieve this, we want to use the existing possibilities within the European treaties and at the same time advocate treaty amendments.
Our values and interests need a common EU voice
- we want to turn the existing role of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy into that of a European Foreign Minister. We also want to strengthen the European External Action Service in terms of personnel and institutions. In order to implement a common European foreign policy, we need a genuine European diplomatic service. That is why we want to firmly establish the European Diplomatic Academy in order to develop competencies in the area of EU foreign policy among
diplomats from the member states. We want to increasingly bundle consular services of the member states, such as visa issues, legal assistance or applications, in the European embassies.
At the same time, there is a need for better coordination of the foreign policies of the EU Member States and closer coordination between the European Commission and the European External Action Service. For better democratic control, we advocate a stronger role for the European Parliament in the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
We want to strengthen foreign cultural, education and science policy as well as science diplomacy, which can build cultural bridges in the face of major global challenges, have a positive impact on civil society, advance research and promote peace.
Protecting the climate globally and fairly
The climate crisis is the central global challenge of our time. It threatens livelihoods in many parts of the world and is driving millions of people to flee their homes. It is exacerbating conflicts over increasingly scarce resources such as food, water and raw materials. Its consequences are already having a noticeable negative impact on people's habitats and future opportunities.
No state can stop the climate crisis alone. Our goal is a strong European foreign climate policy that is in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the sustainable development goals. We stand for an EU that establishes global climate partnerships to mitigate climate change.
emissions, supporting partner countries in the socially just and climate-neutral development and restructuring of their economic systems, infrastructure and energy supply as well as in adapting to the unavoidable consequences of the climate crisis. As one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, the EU must, in accordance with the agreement in the Paris Climate Agreement, advocate that USD 100 billion per year from public and private sources for climate change mitigation and adaptation be mobilized quickly, in a targeted and targeted
manner.
in line with the UN's sustainability goals in countries of the Global South. Just Energy Transition Partnerships, which the German government has already concluded with several countries together with other international partners, are a model for this. They make offers for a comprehensive and socially just energy transition and modernization. We are also supporting the international process to design a loss-and-da- mage fund to provide appropriate financial support to communities affected by the effects of the climate crisis.
Our goal is to drive forward socio-ecological modernization in all areas. We are therefore committed to phasing out fossil fuels, a binding global target for the expansion of renewable energies and ambitious climate financing. This requires
additional funds to the Official Development Assistance (ODA) quota, taking into account the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" of the Paris Climate Agreement. International financial institutions such as the World Bank, the regional development banks, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) must play an even greater role in modernizing the economies of our partner countries in a spirit of partnership.
We want to strengthen and expand the Team Europe approach - closer cooperation between the Commission, member states and EU financial institutions - in order to forge international alliances. The climate club proposed by the G7 can play a central role in supporting international structures within the framework of the Paris Agreement and promoting ambitious goals for climate protection, climate adaptation and sustainable growth. We would like to take the Federal Government's planned strategy for foreign climate policy as a basis for further development at European level.
Climate neutrality and the management of climate impacts must be incorporated into our international political action across all departments.
The climate crisis has long been a reality in many places. Despite all our efforts, this c r i s i s will force people to leave their homes.
Historically, the western industrialized countries are the main producers of climate-damaging greenhouse gases and therefore bear a special responsibility. The EU should therefore support the affected countries technically and, if necessary, financially with the necessary adaptation measures. In addition, Europe should lead the way together with other industrialized countries and support processes in which international regulation is discussed with affected states within the framework of international law to deal with climate-induced migration, flight and displacement as well as access to international protection.
Like the climate crisis, the global loss of species and biodiversity poses an enormous threat. That is why we want to accelerate the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Convention on Biological Diversity
in Europe and worldwide. We are increasing European engagement with the countries most affected by biodiversity loss and supporting the protection of land while respecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Our goal is to put Europe's and the world's biodiversity on the road to recovery.
Making Global Gateway a success
In many parts of the world, there is a huge need for investment in order to achieve growth and prosperity with good mobility and digital participation. This must happen under the conditions of climate neutrality, climate adaptation and social justice. So far, the Chinese "New Silk Road" program, which creates financial dependencies and systematically uses them as political leverage, has been the main response to the need for investment. As an alternative to this, we want to turn the European Global Gateway Strategy into a successful geostrategic project that supports partner countries in sustainably improving their living and economic conditions. In this way, we are making a strong European contribution to the G7 infrastructure partnership and, by complying with high human rights, social and environmental standards, we are helping to strengthen the global economy.
international standards of the G20 for infrastructure planning.
Through targeted investments in socio-ecological modernization in our partner countries, we want to create climate-friendly prosperity, strengthen the protection of human rights, diversify supply chains and promote accessible digital infrastructures and the production of green energy in our neighbourhood. In doing so, we want to reduce dependencies by strengthening sustainable value creation in partner countries and combining this with investments in social infrastructure that are in line with local development agendas.
However, Global Gateway can only be a success if the EU provides the program with substantial funds that, in conjunction with the leveraged private capital, can provide the necessary resources. In order to improve the visibility and connectivity of the program globally and within the EU, we also want to appoint aspecial envoy for it.
The EU must set clear strategic priorities for Global Gateway and develop all projects on the basis of equal cooperation with the partner countries and with the involvement of local civil society. For us, the benchmarks here are human rights, the UN's 2030 Agenda and compliance with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Kunming- Montreal Biodiversity Agreement. For example, mobility infrastructure means prioritizing investment in climate-friendly modes of transport such as rail, and energy generated must always be made available to the producing countries on site first. In addition, the EU Commission must ensure policy coherence for sustainable development and greater transparency in the selection of structural policy projects and in their implementation and evaluation. In order to make Global Gateway a success, development policy expertise must be used during implementation and the principles of development policy effectiveness must be implemented.
Strengthening international organizations
The UN and its organizations remain the foundation of multilateralism. In the case of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the international community in the
The UN General Assembly proved that it is very capable of acting when an overwhelming majority repeatedly and clearly condemned this brutal war of aggression. However, it is clear that the situation in the Security Council makes it difficult for the UN to take peacekeeping measures.
Regional organizations such as the EU therefore have a key role to play in crisis management, including with their own missions. The EU and its member states make more than half of all contributions to multilateral organizations such as the UN system. In the upcoming reform discussions, we want to make the UN and its organizations fit for the future through a coordinated EU approach. This includes reforming the Security Council, in which we want to ensure fairer representation of the world's regions. In addition, we aim to abolish the right of veto and support mechanisms such as the option adopted in UN General Assembly Resolution 377 "Uniting for Peace" to deal with the matter in the event of a persistent blockade and to adopt recommendations - i.e. diplomatic measures, sanctions or military measures in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter - by a qualified majority.
The G7 and G20 are also proving to be additional forums for tackling global challenges, in addition to our involvement in the UN. We therefore support the G7's efforts to work more closely with partner countries around the world and, in particular, with the UN.
in the Global South, and expressly support the permanent membership of the African Union as part of the G20.
In order to be able to respond to the global and development challenges of our time, the EU must advocate comprehensive renewal, democratization
- including greater participation of actors from the Global South - and sufficient funding.
capacity of the international financial institutions. The World Bank has already begun this reform process with its "Evolution Roadmap" and must now continue it with determination. It is crucial that goals such as reducing inequality and protecting planetary boundaries are systematically taken into account and operationalized through indicators. UN specialized agencies such as the refugee agency UNHCR or the health organization WHO provide vital support to help people in need. The EU must therefore continue to support and strengthen these organizations. Corresponding funds should be provided as flexibly as possible.
We also advocate an active, fair personnel policy for the EU when filling positions in international organizations such as the International Standardiza- tion Organization (ISO) or the World Bank Group.
Defending human rights worldwide
Opposition activists are being persecuted in many places around the world, the scope of action of civil society and independent media is being restricted and protests are being crushed. Regardless of this, Wherever people live, they have the right to demand and receive help to protect and promote their basic human rights. We stand up for democracy and human rights and strengthen independent media, non-violent pro-democracy movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights defenders in both the analogue and digital space.
We want to expand funding opportunities and financially stabilize the corresponding protection instruments and institutions, such as special rapporteurs and the European Democracy Fund, and make them more accessible and sustainable. This should also create spaces for exchange and networking between civil society organizations, pro-democratic
movements, independent media and individual activists should be created and strengthened.
The protection and promotion of democracy will be more effective if we pool our efforts and coordinate them at European level.
The protection of human rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the state.
Cooperation with democracies worldwide has a special role to play in promoting freedom and self- determination. We want to actively support and strengthen states that have embarked on the path to democracy in this process. In line with the EU's Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, we support the imposition of targeted sanctions against state and non-state actors responsible for or involved in serious human rights violations and abuses. The EU and its member states must take decisive action against violations of sanctions and also hold international partners to account. In addition, we want to examine the extent to which abandoned assets can be used to make reparations to victims in a legally secure manner.
Human rights defenders risk a lot. They need our protection, our solidarity and our active support. We want to consistently implement the EU guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders. A gender-specific perspective is important here, as women and marginalized groups, such as defenders of indigenous rights, are exposed to a higher risk of violence. We want to offer vulnerable human rights defenders and their families protection in the EU with faster and simplified visa issuance. We are committed to ensuring that the EU's diplomatic missions abroad stand up for human rights defenders. This includes, for example, monitoring the court proceedings of political prisoners, creating international visibility, providing immediate assistance and holding regular exchanges/meetings. This also applies to those who defend the right to conscientious objection.
As part of our support for human rights defenders,
we are committed to providing EU missions abroad with more training in conflict-sensitive democracy promotion and human rights protection.
Following the example of the Canadian resettlement program, we advocate a European protection program for human rights defenders.
This enables them to receive protection quickly and unbureaucratically and to continue their work in a safe environment. Attacks on human rights defenders are increasingly taking place in the digital space. In order to protect them, we support secure, encrypted communication options and the right to use the internet anonymously and are campaigning against the further fragmentation of the internet and internet shutdowns.
Investigative journalists and whistleblowers like Julian Assange also need special protection. They bring crimes and societal abuses to light. Their protection is an essential part of press freedom, which must be urgently defended both internally and externally.
Implementing foreign and development policy in a feminist way
Equality makes societies more peaceful, just, sustainable, resilient and economically successful. It is an integral part of universal human rights.
Structural injustices mean that certain groups, especially women and marginalized groups, are particularly affected by violence, poverty and war, but also by the consequences of the climate crisis. At the same time, there are often only a few of them at the table when it comes to finding solutions to these crises. With UN Resolution 1325 and its follow-up resolutions, the protection of women and girls in war zones and their participation in conflict prevention and resolution is already anchored internationally. We want to go further. We are committed to a feminist foreign and development policy that strengthens the rights, resources and representation of women, girls and marginalized groups in all areas worldwide.
Based on human rights, it has the overcoming
of all forms of discrimination. In this context, particular attention is paid to multiple forms of discrimination. Building on the Federal Government's guidelines, we want to anchor feminist foreign and development policy as a guiding principle of the EU's external relations and international cooperation.
We are committed to equal representation of women in the EU's foreign policy institutions and to significantly increasing the proportion of women at all levels of Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) missions - especially at management level. The perspectives of women and girls should be included in all EU international negotiations. We want to strengthen the capacities for gender and diversity in EU diplomacy and significantly increase the participation of women and marginalized groups in relevant delegations.
We call for the EU to become a global pioneer in the fight against sexualized and gender-based violence in its external relations. Because misogyny, queer and trans hostility is a security threat for many people. Following the EU's accession to the Istanbul Convention, we are calling for its consistent implementation by the EU member states. We also call for the global implementation of the Yogyakarta Principles against discrimination and for the protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, inter* and queer people (LGBTIQ*).
We want the EU to align its development policy with the principles of feminist development cooperation in a partner-oriented and sustainable way, and to make existing practices more sustainable.
critically evaluated. It must achieve its self- imposed goal of ensuring that 85% of EU development programs also contribute to gender equality by 2025. To this end, the EU should structurally provide more funds to promote women and marginalized groups, for example through cooperation with feminist civil society actors or support in the areas of basic education and vocational training, entrepreneurship and sexual and reproductive health. In accordance with the EU Action Plan for Gender Equality, we want to systematically anchor gender- transformative and intersectional approaches in our development policy activities.
2. 
A European security and defense policy
Defending Europe together
Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, has clearly shown us that we must be able to effectively deter potential aggressors from attacking us and defend our way of life militarily in an extreme emergency. The future of alliance defense and collective response capability lies in the European and transatlantic integration and interoperability of our armed forces.
The closer we work together in the EU on security and defense policy, the better, more cost- efficiently and more effectively we can ensure Europe's defense capability, especially as part of the transatlantic alliance (NATO). The EU's strategic compass and its integration into NATO's strategic concept are key to this. We stand by our alliance commitments within the framework of the EU and NATO and the capabilities and capacities required for this. Based on our historical responsibility and the lessons learned from the Russian war of aggression, we are committed to protecting the Baltic states, including through military cooperation as part of a long-term deployment of Bundeswehr units in the Baltic states.
We therefore want to continue working on a common European security and defense union with strong parliamentary participation and control. We want to expand increased cooperation between the armed forces, for example within permanent EU units or transnational units such as the German-Dutch Corps. This requires common framework standards and working conditions for soldiers as well as the creation of the basis for a uniform EU duty of care towards deployed forces and civilian personnel. We want the common
EU command structure and European military cooperation initiatives, for example in the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO).
We are strengthening civilian and military missions within the framework of the CSDP and their planning staff in terms of funding and personnel.
These missions must always be embedded in an overall political concept, be subject to continuous risk analysis, take into account the actual needs on the ground and be oriented towards the guiding principle of human security. For civilian CSDP missions, we must combine long-term financial frameworks with a more flexible concept so that they can be deployed more quickly and adapt appropriately to changing circumstances. Joint EU missions abroad should be accompanied, monitored and evaluated more closely by the European Parliament. We are consolidating support for Ukraine within the framework of the European Peace Facility (EPF) and strengthening its unit for risk analysis and arms control. The structures of the EPF should be adapted to improve the availability of funds, the predictability of expenditure and parliamentary control in the European Parliament and the member states. We also see the establishment of a European air defense system as a necessary component of a common European security architecture.
In the defense sector, the uncoordinated procurement of EU member states leads to a complex system diversity, a lack of economies of scale and thus the ineffective use of taxpayers' money. Our goal is a joint and thus more cost- effective European development and procurement of armaments. This requires the effective implementation of the annual capability analysis in close coordination and agreement with the NATO planning process on the basis of the same standards and norms, financial incentives for and trust between the member states, but also the political will to set aside industrial policy interests in favor of greater common security. This will enable us to consolidate the European defense sector. The European Defense
Agency (EDA) has not yet achieved this to a sufficient extent. We share the objectives of existing financial instruments such as the European Defense Fund (EDF) or joint procurement (EDIRPA). However, these instruments are inadequate, legally fragile and parliamentary control is severely limited.
That is why we want to create a legally secure extra-budgetary financial instrument in the medium term to replace the existing individual programs and cover the entire military capability cycle - from industrial research and development to procurement, maintenance and training. The expenditure of this pot
must be subject to strict and coordinated control by the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
European regulation of arms exports
The joint development, procurement and use of European weapons systems creates greater security and efficiency. And thus also contributes to a common value-based security and defense policy. These joint EU projects require uniform and restrictive European export regulations. To this end, we want to adopt an arms export control regulation based on the EU's common position, which creates transparency and clarity and is based on European values and a common assessment of the security situation. There must be clear
decision-making mechanisms and sanctions that are enforceable before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Prior risk analyses as well as binding and physical end-use controls must be prescribed and consistently implemented. European weapons must no longer be allowed to end up in the hands of regimes that systematically violate human rights or use them for crimes of aggression. We advocate a ban on the export of surveillance technologies to repressive regimes and a comprehensive ban on the export of small arms to third countries.
Disarmament, arms control and the non- proliferation of weapons are and will remain essential pillars of any peace policy. They mean greater global security for all. The goal of our efforts remains a peaceful world free of nuclear weapons. Even in uncertain times, we therefore want to strengthen arms control, promote confidence-building measures and advance bilateral and multilateral disarmament initiatives. The EU should therefore work to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a central pillar of nuclear arms control. In addition, the EU should encourage its member states to constructively support the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, to participate as observers in the Conference of the States Parties and to commit to the Global Zero vision. These are the first steps on the way to successive joint accession and a world free of nuclear weapons. We support efforts under international law to regulate lethal autonomous weapons systems. There must be no use of weapons systems that make the human factor technically dispensable in life and death decisions. We condemn any use of armed drones in violation of international law, even if it is carried out by our allies. We reject the use of cluster bombs, including in Ukraine. We also want to work with the EU worldwide to dissuade non-parties from using cluster munitions in accordance with the Oslo Convention.
Preventing crises
We are committed to a forward-looking foreign and security policy that recognizes conflicts at an early stage and counters them. Cooperation between policy areas and coherence are key to this.
of approaches is important. We want to make comprehensive use of EU funds for civilian peacebuilding actors.
increase funding. The EU must provide greater support for local civil society concepts and actors in peacebuilding, make funding guidelines more flexible in this context and make it easier to plan the allocation of funds over the long term. We want to strengthen EU funds and approaches for stabilization measures in order to be flexible in crises,
to act in a targeted and effective manner. We want to systematically strengthen the peacekeeping and conflict resolution capabilities of the UN and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as regional organizations such as the African Union. We want to strengthen research into the causes of current conflicts, their progression and their peaceful resolution and promote international networking in peace and conflict research.
The EU must use and expand its strength worldwide as a mediator in conflicts and as an alliance for peace through cooperation. We want to strengthen civilian CSDP missions as an instrument of EU foreign policy with more financial resources and personnel and systematically develop them further, for example to support the police or the judiciary in fragile states. With institutions that are based on the rule of law and close to the people, they can build trust and prevent conflicts. We are opposed to focusing civilian CSDP missions on migration management. Effective civilian crisis prevention, stabilization, humanitarian aid and peacekeeping measures require in-depth context analyses, better coordination and effective evaluations. We want to expand the European Center of Excellence for Civilian Crisis Management in order to better network member states in their civilian crisis prevention and crisis management measures.
Through a policy of prevention, we are also making an important contribution to combating the causes of displacement. Established local structures and functioning state institutions that protect human rights and provide services of general interest
reduce the likelihood of conflicts that cause human suffering and force people to leave their homes.
With humanitarian aid, we support people worldwide who are in humanitarian emergencies. We want to strengthen European and international organizations in this area. This includes, in particular, better funding as well as more efficient and flexible structures and allocation guidelines for European organizations.
humanitarian aid organization ECHO. We also want to improve the coordination of national European aid. Finally, we want to oblige European emergency aid organizations to pay more attention to gender-specific needs and the needs of marginalized groups.
3. Global justice
Being a reliable partner
At the heart of our development policy commitment are the people we want to support in their quest for better living conditions on the ground. We therefore stand for human rights- based cooperation with countries in the Global South. China's development initiatives often aim to create one-sided dependencies. In its war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, Russia has shown that it is prepared to use hunger as a weapon. Rising prices for food, energy and transport have exacerbated hunger and economic crises, destabilized countries and brought hardship to people around the world. We want the EU to actively compete for partnerships with the Global South and to intensify the coordinated approach it has begun with the member states to build fair partnerships. We are committed to partner-oriented, feminist, decolonial and sustainable approaches in development cooperation that effectively address systemic injustices.
to dismantle in a targeted manner. In doing so, we also want to
do justice to our colonial past and critically question colonial continuities.
We want to promote local knowledge and local initiatives in order to support the development of economic cycles and social security systems. To this end, we want to further develop the existing instruments of European development cooperation in dialog with our partners. To this end, the EU must strengthen local and civil society actors in universities and NGOs and make funding guidelines more flexible. Collaboration with the private sector, including
Start-ups are part of this. We are committed to ensuring that civil society and, in particular, women's rights organizations from countries in the Global South receive direct support from the EU, following the example of the Canadian Equality Fund. We also want to strengthen global city partnerships that bring issues of global justice into the living spaces of local people and make an important contribution to municipal development cooperation.
In view of the global challenges, substantial funds are needed for development cooperation. We are committed to ensuring that all EU member states keeptheir promise to spend at least 0.7 percent of gross national income on development financing (ODA quota). However, it is not only the quantity of support that is important, but also the implementation of projects in a partner-oriented, fast, unbureaucratic and impact-oriented manner. The development funds must primarily go to the countries most in need and contribute to the fulfillment of the sustainable development goals as well as the Paris Climate Agreement and the Montreal Biodiversity Agreement. In cooperation with our partner countries, we also want to strengthen people's social security. We support the development of social security systems as a sustainable instrument against poverty. The reconstruction requirements for Ukraine should be made available in addition to the ODA quota.
All too often, the EU Commission and member states still work side by side in the field of development policy. We therefore support the Team Europe approach, which aims to improve cross-sectoral coordination, coherence, visibility and effectiveness in cooperation with the private sector. In order to increase coherence and transparency, we advocate cross-sector evaluations and a transparency mechanism for public development cooperation in the EU. We want to better involve the European Parliament in development policy decision-making processes.
In the area of digital development collaboration, we want to create human-centered and responsible
We want to shape responsible digitalization globally and promote digital self-determination. We want to strengthen digital policy exchange, because
As the EU, we can learn a lot from digital pioneers in countries of the Global South. We want to expand adequacy decisions with our partner countries and thus promote participation in international digital value creation.
Securing food globally
The multiple crises of our time, above all the climate crisis, pose existential challenges for food security worldwide. The EU must work towards a sustainable and resilient global food system and thus contribute to the implementation of the right to food.
A resilient and productive organic agriculture with strong regional markets, but also access to supra- regional markets, is the best way to make agriculture more resilient to political crises and the consequences of climate change. European development cooperation projects should increasingly promote economically viable and ecologically and socially sustainable farming systems with nutrient cycles that are as closed as possible. We are committed to ensuring that European agricultural subsidies, patented seeds and land grabbing do not undermine farming structures and markets in countries of the Global South and create one-sided, expensive dependencies. Respect for the individual development opportunities of the countries and the self-determination of the people has the highest priority for us. We want the
Promote the establishment and expansion of local
seed banks and breeding infrastructure so that traditional knowledge and biodiversity are preserved and remain accessible and dependencies in seed development are reduced. We want to advocate stricter mechanisms within the EU to prevent excessive food speculation, especially in emergency situations. Speculation in water must also be strictly regulated. We want to prevent water scarcity from being exacerbated by speculation in addition to increasing droughts and rising water prices.
We want to end exports of synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which are banned in the EU.
The promotion of agriculture based on agroecological principles in countries of the Global South must be implemented as part of comprehensive strategies to strengthen food systems, including access to technologies, infrastructures, markets and financial resources as well as mutual knowledge transfer. The role of women and marginalized groups in nutrition and food production must also be taken into account.
Accepting global responsibility
The legacy of the colonial era still weighs heavily on relations between Europe and former colonies. It can be seen, for example, in the unequal global distribution of wealth, economic dependencies and a lack of representation. The member states of the EU must face up to their historical responsibility resulting from the crimes of colonial history and address power imbalances. This requires an anti- racist perspective and an examination of post- colonial continuities.
We will work to ensure thatthe debate on the recognition of human rights violations, war crimes and the appropriation and destruction of cultural heritage committed by EU member states during their colonial era in countries of the Global South is also conducted at EU level. We want to find a common way to apologize appropriately, to take responsibility with words and deeds and to make idealistic and material reparations within a framework of international law.
We want to correct disadvantageous clauses in trade agreements and drive forward reforms at development banks. We want to better respect the human and land rights of indigenous and local communities in international nature and environmental protection agreements. The euro
We want to continuously evaluate and further develop European development cooperation in cooperation with partner countries and civil society in the sense of a critical reflection of power relations.
Many countries in the Global South are in a debt crisis that massively restricts their options for socio-ecological modernization processes. The EU and its member states must advocate solid debt restructuring and debt relief for particularly burdened countries. To this end, debt restructuring must be further developed under the G20 Common Framework in order to make it more transparent and include all private and public creditors in a binding manner. In the long term, this procedure must be established at the UN. We want to prevent European jurisdictions from being misused for money laundering or tax avoidance, which the
further restrict the financial scope of action of countries in the Global South. We are also committed to reforming the global tax architecture and involving the Global South as partners in order to promote global justice and sustainability. This includes promoting inclusive, fair and effective international tax cooperation at UN level, for example through negotiations on a comprehensive UN tax convention.
4. Fair trade
Creating prosperity with trade
Trade promotes exchange between people and societies and can increase prosperity. This has been demonstrated by the EU itself, of which the single market remains a key pillar to this day.
In Germany in particular, our prosperity depends on well-functioning global trade due to the strong export orientation of our economy. It is therefore a political task for the EU to use its economic and political influence to set global standards for social justice, climate and nature protection as well as human rights through trade policy and to ensure that the EU's trade policy is in line with these standards.
to promote value creation. In this way, we also protect our own standards from undercutting competition and thus act in line with our values and interests.
The crises of recent years - the pandemic, extreme weather and war - have shown that we need to reduce risks in supply chains and access to raw materials. A forward-looking, open trade policy that establishes reliable partnerships makes an important contribution to this. To this end, we must support European companies in diversifying their investment activities and value chains.
Realigning trading instruments
Global trade needs global rules. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the best possible framework for formulating and reviewing these rules and settling any disputes. We want to fundamentally reform the WTO so that it can once again fulfill this role. Good labor standards, access to health products and green technologies, fair development as well as climate, environmental and animal protection must also be placed at the center of global trade policy.
However, the WTO is currently barely able to act due to the tense geopolitical situation and there is little willingness to reform it globally. We are therefore increasingly focusing on regional trade agreements on an equal footing with partners such as Australia, India, the countries of Latin America and the Southeast Asian community of states ASEAN, which are also committed to rules-based global trade. We advocate high environmental and social standards worldwide, also in order to level the global playing field.
We are therefore committed to ensuring that sustainability goals and human rights are included in all future international trade agreements and are enforceable, as in the recently concluded agreement between the EU and New Zealand. In the event of blatant disregard for human rights or violations of the
Paris Climate Agreement, the EU should make consistent use of these clauses or suspend the agreement.
We want to realign the Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), not least in consultation with civil society actors. In this way, we will support the transfer of climate-friendly technologies and important health technologies from the Global North to the South in order to promote the development of the local economy and reduce global emissions. We also want to break down barriers to innovation and its market penetration, particularly in areas that are geared towards the common good and areas of public welfare. To this end, we want to examine the further development of European patent law, for example.
Digitalization can significantly simplify globally fair trade, for example by automating the monitoring of supply chains. Digital trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights, data protection and net neutrality must always be considered in the EU's trade agreements and trade instruments. This requires a revision of European trade instruments in the areas of data regulations and data localization,
Research and development, national tax systems and the digital single market.
We also want to improve the democratic control of trade agreements. Before negotiations begin, the European Parliament should determine the negotiating mandate together with the Council of the EU.
If EU industries are harmed by unfair trade practices, EU trade defense instruments must provide an effective response to protect fair competition.
Conversely, we want to offer less industrialized countries in particular an open dialogue and give them a fair chance in trade agreements to pursue an industrial policy with the aim of creating their own value. In this area, we have made significant progress by constantly expanding our trade
political toolbox has already achieved a great deal. For example, through the instrument against coercive measures (anti-coercion instrument), with which the EU can defend itself against unilateral coercive measures by trading partners.
We are committed to transparent and publicly legitimized forms of dispute resolution in free trade agreements, where these are necessary.
Acting in harmony with the climate
We want to transform our economy into a climate- neutral one and develop it into a strong circular economy. This includes developing standards together with our trading partners so that global markets for green products such as climate- neutral steel can emerge.
The introduction of the border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is an important step towards introducing fair carbon pricing in global trade and supplementing and safeguarding the EU emissions trading system. This will make imports of certain products such as steel or cement from countries without emissions trading more expensive if they are produced using climate-damaging processes. The CBAM thus also supports the modernizatio
The European Green Deal is an important step in the development of our industry, for example by protecting producers of green steel from non- European competition from fossil-based steel and ensuring fair competition.
It is important that we end investments in fossil fuels and other climate-damaging activities and instead incentivize sustainable investments. This requires a fundamental change in the model for bilateral EU investment treaties. The withdrawal from the most climate-damaging investment protection treaty in the world - the Energy Charter Treaty - by Germany and other EU countries is a great success. We are now consistently fighting for the entire EU to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty.
The law on deforestation-free supply chains is an important building block in the goal of combating grave deforestation rates worldwide. To ensure that the law has the desired effect
the EU must now seek partnerships with producer countries and support them in building sustainable supply chains and complying with the requirements. We want to particularly promote the import of products from agroforestry systems in tropical forests.
Focus on fair partnerships
As a global economic player, the EU must place human rights and social justice at the center of a future-oriented trade policy. Ambitious European laws to regulate supply chains and their national implementation are an important lever for achieving these goals and covering not only the direct suppliers, but the entire supply chain.
We are also transposing the new European Supply Chain Directive into national law and adapting national requirements where necessary. We enable injured parties in the EU to assert their rights. In this way, the EU and its member states are taking responsibility for effectively curbing social and environmental dumping worldwide.
Ratification and implementation of the core labor standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO) should be considered a minimum requirement for any trade agreement. Trade agreements must also take into account the concerns of indigenous peoples and communities on the ground and protect their rights.
There are currently more than 25 million forced laborers in the world. Products from this modern form of slavery have no place on the EU domestic market. The EU ban on imports of products from forced labor must therefore be implemented consistently. We want to focus on all forms of forced labor, including in the digital space.
We must ensure fair economic relations with countries of the Global South. We want to review the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the South Pacific in the interests of fair and development-oriented trade. This includes recognizing the special advantages of the Least Developed
countries that allow these countries to import goods into the EU duty-free, also as part of EPAs, and to enable the countries of the Global South to pursue an active industrial policy. In order to support countries in the Global South in reducing their export dependency on unprocessed raw materials, we want to design European and international free trade instruments in such a way thatthey do not prevent the development of local industries and integration into higher value-added chains.
5. More EU in Europe
Prospects for expansion
The enlargement of the EU is a success story and is in our own best interests. It strengthens our security, our stability and our prosperity. That is why it is our responsibility to actively support countries with a European perspective. We want to combine clear criteria for accession with binding offers of cooperation in a fair accession process. In order for an enlarged EU to remain capable of acting, it must reform its structures: Enlargement and reforms must go hand in hand.
All candidate states must fulfill the Copenhagen criteria, the EU's accession criteria, without any exceptions and fully adopt the EU's common law, the acquis.
By advancing EU enlargement step by step, we are dynamizing the lengthy and often cumbersome accession process and securing the credibility of the European project.
It must become more visible: The pace of reform in the accession countries alone determines the pace of accession. National vetoes by EU member states in the opening of chapters should not be allowed.
Accession process must not be blocked. We want to shape the accession process with visible intermediate steps and recognize these with positive incentives, for example access to roaming, Erasmus+ or parts of the internal market. A standstill in the negotiations for a longer period of time
Any delay or even regression should, conversely, lead to a loss of benefits. One focus in the accession process must be on strengthening the rule of law and democracy as well as the fight against corruption and organized crime. To this end, we want to extend the mandates of the
EU anti-corruption authority OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor's Office to the accession countries and the EU funds they use.
Strengthening civil society in the accession states and networking them with each other and with the EU member states is also key for us. On the road to the EU, close cooperation with all democratic forces in the accession countries is important to us, even beyond the governments. Government representatives from the accession countries should be able to participate in selected meetings of the Council of the EU. We expect all accession candidates to fully align with the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the adoption of sanctions against Russia.
Western Balkans
The future of the six Western Balkan states of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia lies in the EU.
The promise of EU accession continues to be an important driver for the sensitive peace and reconciliation process in the countries of the Western Balkans. The EU must not jeopardize this promise of accession. The start of accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia, candidate status for Bosnia and Herzegovina and visa liberalization for Kosovo are important steps forward on the road to the EU.
At the same time, the challenges remain great in view of corruption, organized crime, weak rule of law structures and the inadequate processing of war crimes in some cases. We want to provide the countries in the accession process with intensive support in overcoming these challenges. The EU must counter attempts by authoritarian states to destabilize the region with determination and resolve.
We are united in our opposition. We support democratic development and coming to terms with the past in Bosnia and Herzegovina and welcome the presence of EUFOR to strengthen security in the country. We call on the Serbian government to take a public stand against violence and for peaceful understanding and call on Serbia and Kosovo to reach a lasting solution at the negotiating table. This is a prerequisite for peace and stability in the region and a key to Serbia's EU accession process. We are strengthening KFOR to support the peace process. We want to provide even better support for the region's civil societies, in particular strengthen cross-border youth work in the region and support an inclusive culture of remembrance. As part of the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans, we want to support the region quickly and effectively in developing good jobs, renewable energies, modern rail infrastructure and sustainable investments.
Ukraine
Ukraine is at the center of the European family. Its place is in the EU. Every day, millions of Ukrainians courageously oppose Russia's war of aggression, which violates international law: they are resisting Russia's brutal attempt to subjugate their country and eradicate their culture, to destroy international law and the European peace order.
We are committed to ensuring that the EU does not let up in its humanitarian, political, financial and military support for Ukraine. We will continue to resolutely support Ukraine so that it can regain and defend its sovereignty and full territorial integrity. We stand firmly by Ukraine, its people and their right to freedom, self-determination and self-defense and support the desire for a sustainable peace and robust, reliable security guarantees.
We will also provide Ukraine with comprehensive support on its path to the EU. Both sides will benefit from an orderly and swift
accession process. We are focusing on transparency, the rule of law, a consistent fight against corruption and an active role for civil society and the regional and municipal level. We are already seeing great progress in the reforms necessary for the EU accession negotiations. The people of Ukraine deserve our recognition for changing their country so fundamentally in the midst of a war.
We are committed to ensuring that the EU and its member states provide financial, technical and investment support for the reconstruction of Ukraine. This also requires major financial efforts, the involvement of Ukrainian civil society and significantly accelerated procedures in order to achieve rapid results and strengthen the country against Russian attacks. We are committed to long- term and sustainable financing for the reconstruction of Ukraine. In addition to various state and private financial instruments, this requires grants in particular. We want to examine whether and how abandoned Russian assets can be used for the reconstruction of Ukraine in a legally secure manner.
We rely on a variety of international investigative and judicial bodies to investigate and punish Russian crimes against humanity and war crimes, including the crime of aggressive war. An international mechanism should decide on the compensation of property damage and personal injury caused by Russia to Ukraine and thus create a legal basis for Russia to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.
Ukraine's economy has been severely weakened by the war. We would like the EU to further stabilize Ukraine's economy through macro- financial assistance and to continue this as a sign of solidarity and as a contribution to European security. This also includes pushing ahead with the expansion of alternative export routes for Ukrainian agricultural products beyond the Black Sea (solidarity lanes). This will help Ukraine economically and contribute to global food security.
Georgia and Moldova
The future of Moldova and Georgia lies in the EU. Both countries have long been the target of military aggression and attempts at destabilization by Russia. These have intensified since the beginning of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. We stand resolutely by the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries. We will actively support Moldova and Georgia on their path to the EU, but at the same time demand the necessary reforms. Ins-
As an EU accession candidate and since 2020, Moldova in particular has embarked on a courageous and ambitious reform course, which we consistently support. The Georgian people's desire for EU integration remains huge; the government must now implement the necessary reforms to fulfill the country's European dream.
European Neighborhood
The European family is bigger than the EU. We want an EU thatworks constructively with its European neighbors.
We would like to intensify the EU's cooperation with the Council of Europe in the promotion and defense of democracy and human rights on the European continent. To this end, we are also working towards the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.
We welcome the European Political Community as a platform for closer cooperation with European countries, regardless of whether they are seeking EU membership or not. In the field of energy in particular, this cooperation is in the strong European interest.
We want the EU and the UK to continue to work constructively to intensify their relations again after Brexit. Close economic and military cooperation between the EU and the UK is in our mutual interest. We welcome the fact that the United Kingdom has rejoined the
EU research program Horizon Europe. At the same time, we expect the British government to remove practical hurdles to exchange and cooperation with the EU, such as student visas, as quickly as possible.
In view of the challenges posed by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, we want to preserve the OSCE as an important forum for dialog and crisis prevention. It can play a central role in shaping the post-war order in Eastern Europe.
Turkey
Turkey and the EU - and Germany in particular - have a long-standing friendship and partnership that is reflected in close social, cultural and economic relations. We believe that a democratic Turkey, in which the rights of all its citizens are respected, has a firm place in the EU.
Unfortunately, the current political reality is different: In recent years, the Turkish government has moved further and further away from the rule of law and human rights. With an aggressive foreign and regional policy, Ankara is in some cases aggressively targeting European interests.
The initial blockade of Sweden's accession to NATO and the military offensive in northern Syria, which violates international law, also show what a difficult partner Turkey is for Europe and NATO in the current security situation. At the same time, it has acted as a mediator in the war against Ukraine and beyond.
Despite this ambivalent role, Turkey remains a strategic partner within NATO, for Europe and for Germany. An active Green foreign policy faces up to this dilemma. For us, there can only be a resumption of talks on EU accession once Turkey has credibly embarked on the path to democracy and the rule of law.
We support cooperation inthose areas where it is necessary and possible,
for example on security in the Black Sea or in the fight against climate change. However, we firmly oppose authoritarian policies and nationalist rhetoric that are openly directed against the EU, against the safety of Turkish opposition members in the EU, against refugees, against Kurds and other minorities or against human rights defenders in our own country.
The Turkish government must release the countless political prisoners, including Osman Kavala and Selahattin Demirtas, and comply with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). With
Turkey's disregard for the judgments of the ECtHR makes the ongoing infringement proceedings within the Council of Europe unavoidable.
Disregarding court rulings creates legal uncertainty, which also puts a strain on civil society and economic relations with Turkey.
We continue to stand firmly by the side of the many Turks whoarecommitted to democracy and the rule of law. We would like the EU to give special support to Turkish civil society, which is committed to democratic change.
6. A strong Europe in the world
Eastern neighbors of the EU
Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is a turning point for the EU and our continent. The EU is called upon to find new answers to its neighborly relationship with a hostile Russia. For our Eastern European partners in the EU, we need targeted measures for a new EU policy for Eastern Europe and Central Asia that take particular account of the changed security interests of our partners. At the same time, we must provide special support to the democratic reform forces and civil societies in Russia's European neighbors that are threatened by Russian interference.
We stand firmly by the courageous people in Belarus who have been working tirelessly for democracy and human rights in their country since the protests surrounding the fraudulent presidential elections in 2020. We will continue to stand in solidarity with and strongly advocate for the support of Belarusian civil society and opposition, the release of all political prisoners, the sanctioning of the Belarusian regime and free and fair elections in the country.
Dictator Lukashenka and his regime are guilty of serious human rights violations and war crimes in Belarus and by supporting the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. They must be held accountable for this. We are committed to
in particular for the EU to support the collection and preservation of evidence.
The EU can and should become more involved in all countries of the South Caucasus and actively support existing democracy movements and civil society. Armenia's path to greater political participation and freedoms was paved by Russian pressure and the war over mountain ranges. karabakh massively more difficult. Azerbaijan has decided to use military force to establish facts
to create. We condemn Baku's military attack on Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. The EU must show the autocratic Azerbaijani government clear limits in the event of further offensives. Long- term peace can only be achieved through negotiations. We therefore welcome the EU's efforts to find a sustainable peace solution with Armenia and Azerbaijan. The EU Monitoring Mission in Armenia (EUMA) is making an important stabilizing contribution in this regard. Over 100,000 Armenians have been forced to leave Nagorno- Karabakh.
half of them children and elderly people. The EU should support the integration of refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh in Armenia or enable their return to Nagorno-Karabakh through international protection mechanisms. The protection of Armenian culture and Christian religion in Nagorno-Karabakh must be ensured in order to protect the region's common heritage. The EU should act between
Armenia and Azerbaijan should act as a stabilizing mediator and at the same time strengthen Armenia's democratic reform forces. This should also include the EU supporting Armenia in driving forward the democratic reform process despite all the challenges and strengthening the country's independence from Russia. This requires an even closer partnership and rapprochement between Armenia and the EU, as well as with Germany.
Putin and his regime of power have turned Russia into a totalitarian dictatorship. Security in Europe can currently only exist before Russia
- and not with Russia. Violence, lies, corruption and arbitrariness characterize the political reality.
Civil society has been silenced and the opposition is either in exile or in political prison. We will continue to campaign for the release of all political prisoners. We see ourselves as friends and partners of those whowant a free, peaceful and democratic Russia. We see ourselves as hard adversary of all those who support Putin's criminal regime. We therefore support the European sanctions policy against the regime and its representatives. There can be no economic and trade policy normality with this Russia.
We welcome the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant against the Russian President. He is guilty of the worst human rights crimes and must be brought to justice with the full force of the law.
Transatlantic relations
There is no other country outside Europe with which we Europeans share such a deep common history and such a strong partnership as with the USA. After the Second World War and the end of the Cold War, the USA made a significant contribution to economic development and political unification on the European continent and to the reunification of Germany.
However, transatlantic relations are also
of central importance for our European present and future. We value Canada and the USA as close and reliable value partners and would like to further deepen the EU's relations with both. Since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, our transatlantic partners, and above all the USA, have helped to defend the peace order in Europe and secure the political unity of the Euro-Atlantic alliance. The USA is a key strategic partner: for our security, for the climate-friendly renewal of our prosperity and for the self-assertion of liberal democracy.
Together, we are stronger in the systemic confrontation with China, Russia and other authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Together, we can secure and expand global value partnerships and multilateral forums and agreements. Together, we can shape the global trade order and advance the climate-neutral transformation of our industries. And together we can develop future technologies and at the same time actively shape them for the benefit of people and their freedom.
A strong transatlantic relationship requires partners on both sides of the Atlantic who are able and willing to act. That is why more European efforts a r e needed to develop our own security, defense and economic policy capacities. We want to strengthen the European pillar of NATO, including through closer EU-NATO cooperation.
Anti-liberal tendencies on both sides of the Atlantic endanger the foundation of values on which the transatlantic partnership is based. They must be resolutely opposed.
This also means that we must simultaneously intensify and diversify our strategic partnership with the USA. On the one hand, diversification means putting transatlantic relations on a broader footing - by expanding partnerships with federal states, cities, civil society, business and science.
And diversification also means reducing one-sided dependencies and strengthening the EU's ability to act independently.
The joint EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is a suitable forum for developing joint responses to global challenges. We are in favor of deepening economic relations with the USA in order to createa transatlantic market that follows the highest social and ecological standards worldwide in accordance with the "race to the top" principle and acts as a driving force for green transformation worldwide. An important element of this is the joint work on a club for critical raw materials.
China
For us, China is a partner, economic competitor and systemic rival. However, due to China's increasingly aggressive behavior on the global stage, the partnership is increasingly fading into the background. Internally, the Chinese leadership is acting in a more repressive and authoritarian manner; externally, it is now openly pursuing hegemonic and imperial ambitions and is aggressively trying to expand its own global influence. To this end, China is also increasingly using its influence within the BRICS states (initially Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and now also Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates) and its close partnership with Russia.
This contributes to a further widening of the differences between Europe and China. We therefore advocate closer coordination between the member states and the EU as an institution, as well as a structured exchange of information and closer coordination of relations with China, particularly with our transatlantic and Indo-Pacific partners.
The EU must reduce its one-sided economic dependencies on China, for example in raw materials and medicines, much more quickly and support the European economy in remaining competitive in the long term. This cannot be achieved without an ambitious, independent industrial and investment policy. It is crucial that the EU formulates an independent course towards China. On the other hand, we reject those who advocatea complete decoupling from China.
China is the EU's largest trading partner, but only our third largest export market. The trade deficit is growing: imports from China are increasing, while exports to China are decreasing. China is still dependent on technologies from Europe, and the European market is also attractive for Chinese companies. The EU can make better and more confident use of the existing scope for action here, especially in the area of transparency obligations of Chinese companies with regard to labor, social, environmental and safety standards. Critical infrastructure, such as ports, railroads and digital infrastructure, as well as key industries must be protected from Chinese investment in the long term and throughout the EU.
We support the introduction and use of the EU's anti-coercion instrument as well as a coordinated approach to controls on investments in China and export restrictions in the area of sensitive technologies. With joint instruments, the EU can better defend itself against economic blackmail attempts and achieve a deterrent effect.
The massive and systematic human rights violations against Uyghurs in the province of Xinjiang, but also against Tibetans, religious minorities and representatives of civil society, especially democracy activists in Hong Kong, by the Chinese government must be ended. The protection of human rights is the basis of European policy. This also applies to the international supply chains of European companies. Products from forced labor
in China must not be given access to the European market. We therefore also expect China toratify the key core standards of the ILO.
As part of the EU's one-China policy, we support the relevant participation of democratic Taiwan in international organizations. At the same time, we recognize that the risk of escalation in the Taiwan Strait has increased significantly due to t h e increase in military pressure from the People's Republic of China. A change in the status quo in the Taiwan Strait must not take place against Taiwan's will. We regard Taiwan
as a democratic value partner and arecommittedto intensifying economic, cultural, civil, social and political exchange.
We will work together with China wherever possible on key global challenges such as the debt crisis in countries of the Global South, the financing of economic modernization and climate protection and adaptation measures. This also applies to global health protection, the protection of biodiversity and the protection of the world's oceans. In these and other areas, we remain open to cooperation on the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the core principles of the multilateral order.
Middle East and North Africa
The Middle East and North Africa is a region in upheaval and an important neighbor for the EU. The hopes of the revolutionary movements in the region have remained largely unfulfilled, and in recent years authoritarian actors have once again become entrenched in the region. Despite the difficult situation, however, we want to work closely together to promote economic development in the region.
to support development for the benefit of the people. Their desire for a life in dignity and security and more political participation should be at the heart of European Middle East policy.
There is great potential in the expansion of renewable energies. We see cooperation between small and medium-sized companies as a particular opportunity to strengthen structures beyond the often state-dominated large companies in the region.
In its cooperation with civil society, the EU must be a reliable partner for all those who want to create women's and human rights perspectives and promote freedom and self-determination. Due to its history of colonialism and decades of support for authoritarian governments, Europe has a special responsibility here.
We want to shape a migration policy that does not make us vulnerable to blackmail by authoritarian regimes in the region. A political focus on refugee defense in relation to the southern Mediterranean countries supports authoritarian and dysfunctional regimes that themselves create reasons for flight.
The existence and security of Israel as the national home of the Jewish people with equal rights for all its citizens are non-negotiable. The Hamas terror attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023 were a turning point. After these terrible acts, we stand firmly by the side of Israel and its citizens. Like every other state, Israel has the right under international law to defend itself against attacks such as these within the framework of international humanitarian law. Israel's security is part of Germany's reason of state and the guiding principle of our actions. Peace and security require a two-state settlement with the creation of a sovereign, viable and democratic state of Palestine on the basis of the 1967 borders. To this end, the EU should join the forces of the member states for negotiations between the two sides and offer its active and generous support for the realization of peace.
In addition to our u n w a v e r i n g solidarity with Israel, this also requires consistent support for pro-democratic Palestinian voices. This is also a basis for the creation of Palestinian political institutions based on the rule of law. The peace
perspective also includes the Palestinian Authority clearly condemning terror against Israel and taking action against it. We reject the ongoing Israeli settlement construction, plans for annexations contrary to international law and settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank as obstacles to peace. We want to continue to work in solidarity with those forces in Israel and Palestine that are fighting for peace on both sides. sides for democracy and freedom, human and civil rights and peace. As the largest donor, the EU should also promote the development of democratic institutions and democratic education in its development aid for the Palestinian territories in order to counter hate.
and to promote understanding between Israelis, Palestinians and people from the surrounding neighboring states.
In Iran, we stand alongside the feminist protest movement against the Iranian regime.
This is committed to a democratic Iran, fighting for respect for human rights and the self-determination of the population, including the abolition of dress codes such as the forced veil. We want the EU to critically examine the extension of sanctions against those responsible for the regime and the tightening of sanctions on trade and financial relations on an ongoing basis.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard must be listed as a terrorist organization with legal certainty. In addition, the EU must support the democratic opposition in Iran and in the diaspora and quickly take in politically persecuted Iranians. The Islamic Center Hamburg as a coordination point for monitoring the diaspora in Germany must finally be closed, as must representations in other German cities. The regime is trying to use an aggressive foreign policy and
terror financing to destabilize the region. The terrorist financing of the Iranian regime, which is used, among other things, for the declared goal of destroying Israel, must be combated. With Israel's security in mind, the EU must work together with the USA to prevent Iran from going nuclear. Iran must adhere to international nuclear non- proliferation agreements. Iran has continued to massively violate its obligations under the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, nuclear agreement with Iran) since 2019 and has repeatedly turned down the opportunity to return to the JCOA. This is why the proliferation-related measures in the nuclear sector and sanctions must remain in place. We want to learn from the lessons of the JCPoA negotiations.
We want to counteract the arms spiral in the region with a united EU. We support diplomatic efforts to de-escalate in the region. The normalization of relations must not lead to punitive measures.
This can also lead to a lack of humanity, for example in view of the human rights crimes committed by the Assad regime in Syria.
We bear a special responsibility towards Afghanistan as a result of our many years of involvement and the subsequent hasty withdrawal of Western troops.
Above all, we condemn the ousting of women from almost all areas of public life and do not recognize the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. We are committed to ensuring that the EU continues to p r o v i d e humanitarian aid in view of the dramatic situation in the country and explicitly involves women. Due to their work - for example for the German Armed Forces and international organizations - or their deployment, local forces and human rights defenders are
for human rights in danger. We therefore stand for the consistent protection and reception of local forces and human rights defenders and their threatened families.
Africa
African countries and Europe are closely linked both geographically and historically. We want to support the diverse countries and societies on the African continent in their efforts to create sustainable development and good jobs locally.
We see growing cooperation between the EU and the African continent in politics, business, technology, science and civil society as an opportunity for both sides.
We want to work togetherwith our African partners for mutual benefit and make attractive European offers for sustainable development.
We see the strengthening of democracy as an important task and condemn unconstitutional changes of power, coups and unfree elections that jeopardize democratic development in some African countries.
The European Climate, Energy and Hydrogen Partnerships and the Climate and Development Partnerships are a good example of how they can help to make industry climate-neutral on both continents. We therefore want to expand them. In doing so, it is clear to us that the energy generated and the associated value
The benefits of the value chain must always be available to the producing countries first, especially the poorest and most marginalized people.
The planned cooperation within the framework of the Global Gateway Initiative is a step towards the further sustainable development of both continents and, as an attractive European offer for the major investment needs, contributes to reducing dependence on China and Russia. We want to support regional integration in the African Economic Communities and the African Union, including the emerging pan-African free trade area.
Good governance and the rule of law are indispensable foundations for social and economic development. We want to support civil society and democratic political actors, especially where state structures are weakened or autocratic structures prevail. In the EU, we want to actively support the non-violent commitment of young people in particular to a pluralistic civil society in their countries and to civil conflict resolution. Women and marginalized groups have a special role to play here.
We are committed to ensuring that third-country nationals who are studying in Europe, traveling on business or attendingconferences, for example, have easier and faster access to visas. One contribution to this is the digitalization of visa procedures.
Europe's integration with Africa is still characterized by an imbalance of power.
In addition, the African continent is already suffering particularly badly from the consequences of the climate crisis, which was caused to a significant extent by European emissions. Conscious of our colonial heritage and the associated economic exploitation, we want to shape relationships thatare based on respect and equality.
Indo-Pacific
The economic center of gravity has shifted to the Indo-Pacific region. This is where a large part of global growth, innovation and development takes place.
We want to expand our close cooperation with Europe's key partners such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand and intensify our exchange with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its member states as well as the oceanic island states. We also want to focus on more cooperation on climate protection and economic modernization and at the same time strengthen cultural exchange, civil society actors and the protection of human rights. In particular, we want to further intensify cooperation with Japan as our closest partner in the Indo-Pacific region and the only member of the G7 in the region. One example of this is the digital partnership that the EU concluded with Japan in May 2022 as its first ever partner country.
In the Indo-Pacific in particular, China is becoming increasingly aggressive and at the same time propagating its authoritarian state and social model as a role model. That is why we also want to expand cooperation between the EU and Indo- Pacific states in the area of security and defense policy.
There are many countries in the Pacific region whose existence is threatened by the climate crisis, even though they themselves have contributed little to global emissions. We want to provide them with concrete and financial support in dealing with the consequences of global warming and rising sea levels. We want to anchor climate protection more firmly in trade relations with the countries of the entire region and jointly promote the production of green energy in the region, for example through the EU's Global Gateway Initiative.
We aim to deepen and broaden the EU's relations with India. We welcome the launch of the EU-India Trade and Technology Council in 2023 as well as the
Connectivity partnership. We recognize India's new importance for the provision of global digital goods and want to explore increased cooperation on digital payment systems. Economic cooperation must be based on clear social, minority and climate protection standards. We are increasingly concerned about current domestic political developments in this regard. We support Indian civil society and are committed t o the peaceful resolution of territorial conflicts in border regions.
The EU member states should work within the UN to condemn behavior by the military regime in Myanmar that violates international law and to demand free and fair elections in the country.
Latin America
The countries of Latin America are not only important economic partners, but many are also our value partners. The many democracies there are natural partners for Europe in strengthening multilateralism. Forums such as the revived summit between the EU and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) enable intensive cooperation and partnership with the countries of the continent.
In some Latin American countries, authoritarian governments have established themselves that severely restrict civil society's scope for action. Democratic states are also still under pressure, as demonstrated by the storming of government buildings in Brazil in early 2023. Events like these make it clear that democracy must be defended against autocratic tendencies and groups.
Cooperation with democratically elected governments and a strong civil society are essential for this. We want to protect activists for human rights, environmental protection and the rights of LGBTIQ*, women and indigenous people and actively support their work. Effectively combating corruption and drug-related crime is also important. In addition to police and criminal law measures, this also includes the creation of
economic alternatives, reducing dependencies on cartels and strengthening cross-border investigations.
Over 55 percent of the world's rainforest is located in Latin America. The region is central to protecting our global climate. That is why we want to intensify climate, commodity and development partnerships and expand cooperation for sustainable agriculture and effective nature and tropical forest conservation. The protection of the rights of indigenous peoples must be considered and prioritized in all projects.
Europe needs close trade relations with Latin America, not least in order to diversify its supply chains with a view to China. These can only be successful if they are negotiated in a spirit of partnership, both sides benefit and a substantial share of trade is created.
part of the added value remains in Latin America. The EU's Global Gateway Initiative can play an important role in this. We want to learn from the mistakes of the past and shape our future trade policy in such a way that no environmental destruction is fueled and no neo-colonial exploitation occurs. We want partnerships at eye level. We reject the
EU-Mercosur agreement in its current form and call for renegotiations to bring about fundamental changes - for a fair, ecological and post-colonial agreement that respects human rights, promotes technology transfer, and promotes the development of new technologies.
and puts an end to the intensive extraction of raw materials in the Global South for consumption in the Global North. We will only ratify the Mercosur agreement if both sides agree to implementable, verifiable and legally binding, enforceable obligations in the areas of environmental, social and climate protection. Especially in times of right- wing populist governments, all of these standards can only be implemented if violations of them can be sanctioned just as effectively as the trade provisions of the agreement. The possibility of suspending trade preferences
The protection of the environment in the event of violations of sustainability standards is therefore an essential prerequisite for approval of the agreement. At the same time, for us, the Mercosur agreement can only exist together with an equivalent additional agreement on the protection and preservation of the rainforest, the protection of indigenous peoples and human rights. This will ensure that our partnership with the Mercosur countries is intensified and that human rights, biodiversity and the global climate are protected at the same time.
 What protects freedom 
The European Union (EU) is an area of freedom, security and democracy. Europeans have built it on the ruins of war and oppression. Today, it guarantees that we can travel without border controls where barbed wire, walls and barriers once separated us. It ensures freedom of expression where dictators ruled just a few decades ago. It protects the rule of law. It guarantees that all EU citizens can freely elect their governments - from the municipal level to Brussels.
The Europe that we want to continue to shape offers security and protection, brings people together and integrates them. We must not only endure differences, but see them as opportunities; we must build bridges across borders and divides; we must seek the unifying element instead of inactively accepting what divides us: Nothing else is the founding idea of the EU.
But security and protection need institutions that create and maintain them. We want to strengthen them. Extremism, disinformation and crime do not stop at national borders, on the contrary: in recent years in particular, we have
experienced how authoritarian states attack our free society. The EU has a responsibility to offer the protection that citizens rightly expect through coordination and strong institutions of its own - especially as this experience of security and state reliability directly increases trust in the democratic association of states that makes up the EU.
The development of the EU is a development towards an ever closer alliance. This is good, because we need the EU's weight and capabilities to solve many of the pressing problems of our time. How we do this must be determined in a democratic process. At the heart of this is the European Parliament, whose rights we want to extend. In this way, we will create the basis for a federal European republic with its own constitution. Even if decision-making processes in Europe are sometimes tedious and lengthy, they are still of great value: with the power of the word and discussion, a compromise is often reached at the end that may not completely satisfy everyone, but helps everyone move forward. This is what we stand for.
After all, the increase in freedom, security and democracy that European unification has brought since the Second World War is one of the greatest political successes in world history. It is not without reason that the EU is the target of extremists of all kinds: those who believe that women should not have the same rights as men, those who want to silence free media, those who want to enforce their interests through disinformation and hate speech - the EU is a thorn in their side.
We want to strengthen the EU's ability to protect the rights and freedoms of those who live here. Our credo: We protect our freedom best when we expand it. We want to strengthen European democracy so that the best ideas can compete fairly for the future of our continent. We want to expand the rule of law, which offers all citizens security and equal rights. We want an EU that works for its citizens. We want them to be able to have an even clearer say in its course through the European Parliament.
And we also want the EU to demonstrate the necessary assertiveness internally, for example against governments such as Viktor Orbán's Hungarian government: Anyone who violates the EU's fundamental values should not be able to benefit from its privileges without restriction.
The possibility of equal participation for all is one of these fundamental values - and a basic prerequisite for our cohesion. This applies not least to women's rights. As long as half of the population is disadvantaged in many areas of life, our democracy will not be complete. And as long as trans, inter and non-binary people are discriminated against, not everyone can participate equally. Authoritarian forces within and outside Europe are calling our cohesion into question by declaring individual groups to be the enemy. This weakens us all and threatens to divide our continent. We are firmly opposed to this. A diverse Europe is a strong Europe: it ensures that everyone can contribute and participate. We stand firmly by the side of all those who are marginalized and discriminated against. And because we see the EU as a pioneer of value- driven digitalization, we also want to safeguard democracy and the rule of law online.
The EU is strong when it is essentially an alliance of values. These values must be credibly
be lived. This applies not least when dealing with people who want - or need - to come to Europe. The deaths in the Mediterranean and the situation at Europe's external borders are untenable. We stand for humanity and order in dealing with refugees. We want to offer protection for people fleeing war and political persecution. have to flee. We want to shape immigration in such a way that those who want to contribute to the success of our community as computer scientists or nurses, as students or harvest workers can also make this contribution. Migration is not only a driving force for progress, it is also an effort.
People come to Europe with different perspectives, experiences and images of society. We want to face up to this major challenge politically. So that
this succeeds, it requires the willingness to work together
Shaping immigration societies on the basis of European values. This applies to the people who live here as well as to those who come to Europe, some of whom have completely different values.
United in diversity, that is the motto of the EU. It should be a community, it should remain a community - across all differences and challenges. We are committed to an EU that sees itself as the driving force behind the ever closer integration of our continent. For a continent in which people live securely in freedom and under democratic values. For an EU that offers a home and does not isolate itself. We want to be this Europe.
1. Democratic institutions
Defending the rule of law
Respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law, including the rights of minorities, is the foundation of the EU. When governments in member states systematically erode this value base by undermining the independence of the judiciary - the first guardian of the rule of law -, c u r t a i l i n g	t h e freedom of the opposition and civil society, fighting free media, restricting women's, minority and LGBTIQ* rights, denying the right to asylum or opening the door to corruption, they pave the way for discrimination.
In doing so, they weaken the EU. It is therefore essential that the existing rule of law instruments are used and developed more consistently and quickly.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, the basic law of the EU, is intended to offer protection to all people living here. As its application is limited to the implementation of EU law, its protective effect has so far been limited. We want to change this: it should also apply to purely national actions of the member states and be enforceable there. If
a government violates the fundamental rights of its citizens
violated, it should also be able to be prosecuted at European level. We also want to strengthen the enforceability of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, which monitors compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, within the EU.
We want to give more weight to the existing Rule of Law Check and the Rule of Law Dialogue, which examine the rule of law situation in all member states. We will ensure that the freedom of civil society in particular is measured and protected in a more targeted manner. In order to increase the pressure for reform, we rely on binding reform agreements between the EU and the member states, which must be subject to sanctions in the future. Public debates on this in the European Parliament must become the rule and be incorporated into the assessments. The rule of law procedure under Article 7, which can lead, for example, to the withdrawal of voting rights in a multi-stage procedure, should be made usable again. This is to be achieved by the Member States in the Council of the EU (Council of Ministers) and in the European Council no longer voting by consensus but by qualified majority at all stages of the procedure.
The disbursement of EU funds should be linked to compliance with the rule of law, democratic principles and fundamental rights. In order to effectively stop the misuse of European taxpayers' money, for example through systematic corruption, favoritism and nepotism in favor of certain parties, the review must not stand alone. An effective separation of powers and the comprehensive granting of fundamental rights are also crucial. That is why we are extending the budget mechanism to include compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This means that in the event of violations, EU funds must be frozen proportionately and, if necessary, in stages.
When it comes to infringement proceedings, we rely on clear rules and more transparency. The Commission fulfills its role as guardian of the treaties when the law is respected. Delayed enforcement of EU law harms everyone.
In order to strengthen our common values, we rely on a better coordinated, mutually reinforcing application of all legal instruments between the Council, Commission and European Parliament. We combine the respective findings into a common basis for evaluation. In order to guarantee a regular charter check that is accepted by all member states, we are creating an independent commission of experts to support the EU Commission. If member states want to receive EU funding in the future, they must commit to cooperating with the European Public Prosecutor's Office. However, when funds are cut, it must not be the people in the municipalities who ultimately suffer because corrupt governments shirk their financial responsibility and prefer to point the finger at Brussels. Therefore check
we are investigating how municipalities can be
supported directly.
Daring more democracy
The strengthening of the EU must go hand in hand with its further democratization and greater proximity to citizens. To this end, we want to further strengthen the directly elected European Parliament. The Parliament should be on an equal footing with the Council in all policy areas and, like any parliament, be able to pass laws on an equal footing, for example in tax or security policy. It should be given a full right of initiative so that it can initiate laws independently. We want to extend its right to convene committees of inquiry and summon witnesses. It should also be able to elect the Commission on the proposal of the Commission President and dismiss it again in an emergency.
More democratic legitimacy of decisions at EU level requires more transparency in the European Council and in the Councils of Ministers. The debates and the positions of the individual member states should be made more comprehensible.
Our vision is the European Federal Republic with a European constitution. The parliament should be united in a bicameral system.
become an equal part of the legislative power with the Council.
In order to make the European elections more European and democratic, we want all parties to nominate lead candidates. In turn, the European Parliament elects the next President of the Commission from their ranks. In addition, only candidates from their own country are eligible to stand in the European elections. We want to change this in the interests of a cross-border election campaign. In future, some MEPs should no longer be elected via national lists alone, but via European transnational lists. The European affiliation of national parties should also be clearly recognizable in the remaining national or regional constituencies. We also advocate that the European Parliament should better represent women and underrepresented groups.
We advocate lowering the barriers to voting. Anyone who lives permanently in the EU must also be able to participate in politics there. EU citizens should be able to vote at their permanent place of residence in the Union - not only for local parliaments and the European Parliament, but also in regional and national elections. Anyone who has their permanent place of residence in Germany must have the opportunity to take part in all elections, votes and democratic processes here on an equal footing.
Young people are getting involved and want to help shape Europe. That is why the introduction of the right to vote from the age of 16 in Germany for the European elections was a great success.
We want young people to be better involved in political processes. That is why we will lower the voting age further if necessary on the basis of an evaluation immediately following the European elections.
In addition to the democratic representation of citizens in the European Parliament, we also want to enable more direct participation at EU level. In the Parliament, we will also
work towardsgiving MPs more time to work in their home regions so that they can be approached locally.
With the European Citizens' Forum, whichtook place for the first time in this legislature as a conference on the future, European citizens, who are drawn at random and representatively from the entire population of the EU, can formulate concrete proposals for action in a citizens' report. We want to firmly establish this instrument, enable digital participation and workto ensure that citizens' proposals are implemented.
We want to expand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), which allows citizens to place an issue directly on the European political agenda, and make it more binding and better known.
A successful ECI must be followed by a legislative proposal from the European Commission within one year and submitted to the European Parliament and the Council for a vote. The initiators of an ECI should also be able to convene a European Citizens' Forum as an intermediate step.
Becoming more capable of action
In view of the many challenges we face, we are dependent on an EU that is capable of acting. That is why we want to make decisions faster by extending majority voting, for example by applying the passerelle clause. Where unanimity was previously required between states and decisions could therefore easily be blocked, in future, voting should be by qualified majority. It is important that the interests of smaller member states continue to be heard and respected.
Secondly, we want to make better use of the enhanced cooperation clause provided for in the treaties. It allows a group of at least nine EU Member States to cooperate more closely in selected policy areas and initiate joint projects. This will enable them to get important projects off the ground more quickly.
the future. What is important for us is that the European Parliament should be involved - and all other member states should also be able to join in at a later date.
Some of the reforms are possible without amending the treaty. They should be implemented swiftly and promptly. A number of the reform proposals that we advocate require a treaty amendment. To this end, we want to convene a convention with the involvement of EU citizens.
This should incorporate the recommendations of the groundbreaking Conference on the Future of the EU. Here, citizens played a key role in formulating new perspectives for the EU.
Fighting corruption
Democracy depends on the trust of citizens, any appearance of politics for sale causes damage. We are therefore ensuring greater transparency in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council in order to strengthen the credibility of democratic processes and trust in the EU. We make lobbying interests and conflicts of interest visible to everyone. With the corruption scandal involving individual MEPs in 2022, this is more urgent than ever. We support the extension of criminal liability for bribery and corruption of MEPs at EU level.
We are finally putting the European Parliament's Code of Conduct into sharp focus. Financial penalties must be swiftly enforced in the event of legally established violations. With a lobby register that is binding for all EU institutions, including the Council, we will disclose who comes in and out of the institutions at all political levels. We will make those who influence legislation visible by means of a "legislative footprint", which will make it comprehensively comprehensible which positions have been introduced in the legislative process.
We will put an end to ineffective self-regulation and set up an independent ethics authority to enforce the rules on lobbing control for all EU institutions. When switching between politics and business, we will ensure that there are clear
time rules that are adapted to transitional payments and for their control. The fact that MEPs now have to disclose their financial circumstances to Parliament and investigating authorities makes corruption more difficult. We want to make this transparent, as is already the case in many Member States.
We guarantee more fairness with an EU-wide database that transparently records political online advertising and its clients and donors and sets clear limits on the use of personal data in digital election campaign advertising
in democratic competition and more protection against disinformation and online hate.
The legal framework for the confiscation of assets acquired through corruption or from the proceeds of such illegal assets is to be further strengthened.
2. Feminism
Making Europe a driving force for women's rights and equality
We want a Europe in which all people, regardless of gender, can live self-determined lives and participate equally. Structural disadvantage and gender-specific discrimination prevent women, trans, inter and non-binary people in particular from doing so.
Our response to this is a feminism that takes all people and multiple discrimination into account.
Women and girls should be able to live an equal and self-determined life throughout the EU. In politics, business, culture, science and society - there is still a lot to be done everywhere. Europe has often been a pioneer for women's rights and gender equality. But right-wing and right-wing conservative forces in many countries are targeting our achievements. They are trying to push women out of the labor market through backward-looking family policies. Reproductive rights, especially the right to abortion, are human rights
and must apply equally to all and in all member states. However, the reproductive rights of women, especially those from marginalized groups such as queer women, are being openly questioned.
Achievements
in the fight against violence against women are being pushed back and the rights of trans, inter and non-binary people are being called into question. We are opposing this with all our might.
Our goal is for the EU to become a guarantor of gender equality on our continent. Gender equality should permeate all policy areas of the Union. That is why we want to strengthen and expand the EIGE (European Institute for Gender Equality). This requires greater knowledge, more data and scientific expertise. This is another reason why we will continue to promote gender studies and defend them against attacks.
The EU Commission's Gender Equality Strategy, which expires in 2025, must be evaluated swiftly and comprehensively. Based on these results, we will draw up an ambitious plan in the coming legislative period in order to make great strides towards equality.
All people must be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and their lives. We therefore also want the EU to strengthen the self- determination rights of women and girls. This includes ensuring reproductive health and the right to physical self-determination and self- determined family planning for all. We want to strengthen unrestricted access to contraceptives. Professional advice on family planning is the basis for self-determined decisions.
It must be widely available in the EU. We support the initiative to enshrine the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Access to menstrual hygiene products is part of good healthcare. That is why we want to improve it.
Realizing equal opportunities on the labor market
Everyone benefitswhen women have better opportunities on the labor market. As engineers, educators, doctors and in countless other professions, they create prosperity - for Europe and for themselves: because fair participation in the labor market helps women to improve their economic situation and avoid poverty in old age, for example. We also want to pave the way politically to achieve this goal.
The gender pay gap, i.e. the gap between men's and women's wages, is wide in all EU countries. On average
It is 12.1 percent in Germany and even around 18 percent. The adoption of the Pay Transparency Directive was therefore a great success. It creates more transparency through the right to information and reports, compensation claims in the event of gender-based pay discrimination and thus strengthens the rights of female employees. We are doing everything we can to ensure that this directive is also implemented consistently in the member states. And, of course, so-called care professions, which are mainly carried out by women, must be upgraded through better working conditions and pay, and the fairer distribution of paid work and unpaid care work between women and men must be improved.
In order to create equal access and advancement opportunities for women in the labor market and to increase gender equality, the European Council issued a reconciliation directive. This is intended to enable parents to reconcile their professional and private lives as partners. With the family start time, which allows partners to take 14 days off work after the birth, the German government will take a further step towards fulfillment and support couples in the division of work between partners. We are continuing to push for the implementation and expansion of this directive. In particular, we want to encourage fathers to take parental leave. A good work-life balance for couples
is an effective measure to counteract the existing shortage of skilled workers by increasing the employment rate of women. Many women would like to work more, and more and more men would like to share family tasks equally - but the conditions do not allow it.
Particularly striking is the low proportion of women in all areas of the so-called STEM professions and the corresponding degree courses throughout Europe. Even though the number of female first-year students is increasing, this is not reflected in academic careers. This must change, because in view of the shortage of jobs and skilled workers, it would be downright negligent to forego this potential. Accordingly, we want to actively promote women and girls and, at the same time, improve the labor supply for the STEM sector. At EU level, we are also calling for better financing options for loans and equity financing for young female entrepreneurs and innovators through EU funds and programs, as well as easier access for women to existing funds, but also to well-paid jobs.
Enforce protection against violence
We want a Europe that offers protection and support for all victims of gender-based violence. We are committed to ensuring that violence against women is prevented, prosecuted and condemned through preventive measures. An important building block for this is the financial independence of women, especially mothers and their children, as it facilitates separation from violent partners and is therefore an important prerequisite for a self-determined life. The Istanbul Convention is the first instrument in Europe to lay down legally binding standards specifically to combat violence against women and domestic violence. Thanks to the German government's initiative, all reservations have finally been lifted in Germany.
To date, however, six member states - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia - have not yet ratified this convention. It is therefore a
It is a great success that the EU itself has acceded to the Istanbul Convention comprehensively and without exceptions. We want all services provided by the Member States to protect women to at least meet the obligations of the Istanbul Convention and its explanatory report - including the standards for shelters, support centers for victims and emergency hotlines. In addition, intersectional protection concepts and shelters, especially for trans, inter and non-binary people, must be developed and provided. The supplementary new EU directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence must now also be adopted and implemented swiftly. We are committed to ensuring that the Istanbul Convention is also implemented with regard to the protection needs of trans, inter, lesbian and non-binary people.
is implemented.
Women affected by violence whose residence status depends on the residence status of their husband or partner should be able to obtain an independent residence permit. To make it easier for these women to claim and enforce their rights, they need low-threshold access to trained multilingual advice and support structures.
Sex workers also need rights and protection from violence, stigmatization and criminalization.
Strengthening women's rights and combating human trafficking
Human trafficking is a serious criminal offense and human rights violation that we must consistently combat through joint European action. The most widespread form of human trafficking in the EU is for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Trafficked persons are forced to work in prostitution under inhumane conditions. More than half of the victims of human trafficking for the purposeofsexual exploitation in the EU are EU citizens, predominantly women and girls.
We want to strengthen international cooperation in prevention, prosecution and protection.
of those affected along the lines of existing agreements. In order to better protect women from human trafficking and violence, we want to strengthen their rights. We are doing this by supportingthe upcoming revision of the
EU Victims' Rights Directive to ensure that all victims of crime are better protected. We want to strengthen access to information on victims' rights and ensure good coordination between the Member States, public bodies and judicial authorities. The protection of victims must be at the center of our actions. Deporting victims of human trafficking is wrong. Instead, we want to protect them through permanent residence rights and protection programs. This would also increase their willingness to report and testify and make it easier to prosecute the perpetrators.
Turning half the power into reality
As long as women are not adequately represented in key areas of the economy, politics and society, democracy is not complete. Even in Europe, we still have to look with a magnifying glass to find women on supervisory boards and management boards. We welcome the fact that the directive on management positions has finally come into force. The Commission must now ensure that the relevant quotas are achieved through regular reviews. After all, binding quotas are an effective means of ensuring that management bodies in business and politics are gender parity, including in the institutions of the EU itself. The Commission itself should also have gender parity.
To make financial power in Europe more gender- equitable, we want effective gender budgeting and gender equality checks
for the EU budget. We have succeeded in making future EU budgets fairer for all genders: The new Financial Regulation now stipulates that the allocation of EU funds by gender must be made transparent. We are committed to ensuring that this transparency is also emphasized in the negotiations with the Council and included in the Financial Regulation for the EU.
all funding is determined. This makes existing inequities in the distribution of funds visible and can be corrected. The Commission has also developed a method for measuring
of the impact of budget funds on equality. However, this still needs to be improved in some areas. Due to the new data situation, the next multiannual financial framework must be designed to be gender-equitable.
3. Europe's diversity
Strengthening civil society
Europe is characterized by its diversity and the coexistence of different people. Queer and non- queer people, people with and without disabilities, atheists and religious people, young and old each contribute their perspectives on life and shape our coexistence and our democracy. Our pluralistic democracy is strong because people in citizens' initiatives and parties, associations, non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and religious communities shape a vibrant civil society. It is the task of the EU to safeguard these freedoms.
We therefore support the European civil society in thinking and organizing itself across borders. In the European Parliament, we have successfully launched an initiative for a European law on associations. In this way, we are ensuring that civil society initiatives can operate with legal certainty throughout Europe.
Civil society initiatives are often the first point of contact for people who experience discrimination such as anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny or queerophobia and violence. We want to further promote and expand the existing advisory structures so that they can provide appropriate advice to those affected.
We are committed to ensuring that funding programs such as "Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values" (CERV) are adequately funded.
become. For example, we support initiatives and self-advocacy organizations that campaign against discrimination and for equal rights for all people and are particularly active in countries wherethe rule of law, democracy and minority rights are under particular pressure. We must also strengthen and safeguard the values of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, such as freedom of assembly, in the EU.
We firmly oppose the restriction of civil society's scope for action and are committed to the protection of human rights defenders within the EU.
Religion and faith are part of our cultures and have an integrative power for broad sections of society. They are the basis of many communities and institutions that contribute to cohesion. Religious freedom is constitutive for a diverse and free society. People who are persecuted because of their faith, non-faith or world view deserve our protection. We want to deepen interfaith dialogue and support communities in this,
to bring people of different faiths into contact with each other. We are convinced that mutual respect and dialog at eye level will strengthen our diverse Europe.
Overcoming discrimination
Safety, the right to physical integrity and civil rights apply to all people. They are the prerequisite for a life
in freedom. They must apply regardless of where a person comes from, how he or she loves, lives or believes. A Europe that holds together in its diversity and protects the rights of each and every individual creates democratic progress, participation and freedom for all. However, people in Europe are still exposed to violence and exclusion due to anti-Semitism, racism and other forms of group-based misanthropy. We want to eliminate discrimination at all levels.
In order to fulfill the promise of a diverse Europe of participation, the EU must take consistent legal action against discrimination.
approach. We want to draw particular attention to multiple discrimination.
Anti-Semitism is still deeply entrenched in the heart of European society. Jewish institutions are threatened and attacked.
We are resolutely opposed to this. This applies in particular to us as Germany and to the promise "Never again!", to which Europe also committed itself after the Second World War and the Shoah. It is the responsibility of all member states to guarantee the safety of Jewish communities and to ensure that Jews in Europe have a secure future.
We are therefore in favor of increasing European funding for security projects to support them in this. As Europeans, it is not
It is not only our task to counter anti-Semitism in all its forms, but also to make Jewish life visible in all its diversity and to strengthen it. Culture plays an important role in this. The perspectives of Jewish artists are an important part of European culture. Discrimination and boycotts against Jews must therefore be resolutely opposed. In order to impart knowledge about Jewish life in general as well as contacts and experiences with Jewish people throughout Europe, we want to promote political and cultural education programs.
Muslims are the second largest religious community in Europe. Muslim life is part of Europe and at the same time has become the target of right-wing and conspiracy ideology movements.
We welcome the fact that, after a long time, the EU has finally filled the position of EU coordinator against Islamophobia. We want to strengthen her role.
We want the fight against antigypsyism to become a new priority and move away from paternalistic approaches. People with a Romani background are often disadvantaged when it comes to access to education, health, housing and work. We are setting up a European advisory body to promote political participation and the fight against racism against Sinti*zze and Rom*nja. This includes
We work with experts, self-advocacy organizations and local and regional authorities, among others. We advocate the introduction of binding laws to promote equal participation.
People who experience discrimination, whether by public institutions, in housing or on the labor market, must not be left alone, but must know that the law is on their side. The EU has the potential to improve protection against discrimination, be it on the basis of social origin, racial discrimination, sexual orientation, disability or age. We want to make consistent use of this. In order to standardize and strengthen the level of protection and close gaps in protection, we want, among other things, the 5th Anti-Discrimination Directive to finally be adopted. Germany should also give up its reservation. We stand firmly by the side of people who experience violence as a result of discrimination and want to support them, for example by providing access to legal, medical and psychological advice. We want to strengthen the systematic recording of cases of discrimination throughout Europe in order to further develop European anti-discrimination work in a targeted and scientifically sound manner.
We want to promote research into racism and its various forms, such as anti-black racism, at European level. The
We are driving forward the UN Decade for People of African Descent. Measures to reduce racism, anti-Semitism and discrimination should be developed with the continuous involvement of experts and self-advocacy organizations. We also want the EU to support member states, for example through training, in counteracting discriminatory attitudes in law enforcement agencies. The office of the European Commission's Anti-Racism Commissioner should be strengthened and staffed beyond 2025. We support the Minority Safe Pack initiative and want to strengthen minority rights such as the preservation of language, culture and identity in the EU. We also need an independent institutional European
Promotion of national minorities. In order to guarantee minority rights in the EU, the responsibility for the protection of national minorities and autochthonous ethnic groups should be bindingly regulated within the EU Commission.
The diversity of European society is currently not adequately reflected in the staff of the European Commission. We are therefore working to ensure that the Commission, as an employer, actively develops and implements concepts for discrimination-sensitive opening, for example in application procedures.
Protecting queer rights
The opportunity to develop freely and live in one's own individuality is a core of European values.
Although queer people have been able to successfully fight for many of their rights in recent decades, we are seeing authoritarian forces trying to roll them back. Queer people still do not have access to non-discriminatory healthcare, a self- determined change in their gender registration or marriage everywhere. It is not uncommon for lesbian, gay, bi, trans*, inter* and queer people (LGBTIQ*) to be unable to lead a self-determined life in safety because their rights are restricted or they are hostile, pathologized or attacked in everyday life and queer hostility is widespread in large parts of society. We do not accept this and clearly oppose these attempts, regardless of their motivation or who they come from. We want a Europe that recognizes sexual and gender diversity as a matter of course.
On our initiative, the European Parliament has declared the EU an "LGBTIQ* Freedom Zone". On this basis, we are committed to ensuring that the EU Commission and the Council use all the instruments at their disposal - including
infringement proceedings and sanctions - to stop the systematic actions of governments against LGBTIQ* people and the dismantling of democracy and the rule of law.
pen. In this way, we are strengthening the community in its fight for its rights in these countries.
In order to combat queer hostility, we are committed to continuing the European Commission's LGBTIQ* equality strategy beyond 2025 and are working towards its further development with the participation of civil society. We want to set up an EU-wide multilingual advice hotline to which victims of queer hostility can turn for low-threshold advice.
Family is where people take responsibility for each other - for example with two mothers, two fathers, several parents, single parents or with a mother and father. We are committed to equality for two- mother families and for a non-discriminatory life for rainbow families. National borders must not determine whether children grow up with their parents, because the right to freedom of movement must also apply to rainbow families without ifs and buts. We are fighting for parenthood, registered partnerships, extended custody declarations and same-sex marriages established in one EU country to be recognized throughout the EU.
Realizing an inclusive society
We want an inclusive society that overcomes disadvantages of all kinds and offers equal opportunities and possibilities to all people. Consistently removing barriers ensures cohesion, prosperity and freedom. The European disability movement has successfully campaigned for their right to equality and participation. With the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the EU member states have committed themselves to removing all barriers that stand in the way of participation in political and social life. We want to ensure that this finally becomes a reality throughout Europe.
In order to enable self-determined living, we want to provide greater support for independent living, inclusive living and working. In particular, we want to promote participation in work
and training in the regular system and consistently expand them. The Commission should regularly review the progress made in the Member States. We want to further develop the sheltered workshop system in the direction of inclusive companies - because social protection and minimum wages must also apply to people with disabilities. EU funds should not flow into forms of work that are contrary to Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and inclusion companies should be promoted more strongly.
The needs-based expansion of affordable, barrier- free and disabled-friendly housing and self- determined forms of living is and remains a central task in shaping an inclusive society.
People with disabilities are more affected by violence than non-disabled people. We want protection from violence to apply to all people in Europe. We are committed to ensuring that forced sterilizations, which particularly affect women and girls with disabilities, are ended in Europe and made a punishable offence.
Poor usability of websites, steps without ramps, doors that are too narrow - people with disabilities, but also older people or people with limited mobility, experience various barriers in their everyday lives that restrict their participation in public life. We are committed to ensuring that the EU Accessibility Directive, known as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), is implemented and enforceable in all member states - including Germany - in a timely manner. In order to support the member states in implementing accessibility measures in a coherent manner, we want to set up an EU Accessibility Center.
We want to strengthen and consolidate the office of the Equal Opportunities Commissioner. We want to remove bureaucratic hurdles and technical standards that prevent people with disabilities from participating and check that they are barrier-free.
In order to guarantee European freedom of movement for people with disabilities, we want to
We will introduce a European disability card that can be applied for at a low threshold, implement mutual recognition of national definitions of disability and barrier-free travel throughout Europe. This also applies to the use of social benefits.
4. A vibrant cultural landscape
Culture as a pillar of democracy
Few things unite Europe as much as its diverse, vibrant culture. It arises from the interplay of traditions from the entire continent
with external influences and the constant development of new forms of expression. Culture is a value in itself and at the same time an indispensable part of European democracy, because it is here that exchange and coexistence across borders take place in the most diverse ways. An open and diverse culture is the best protection against nationalistic thinking, isolationism and lack of freedom. Because of their indispensability for a consolidated democratic society, cultural institutions and cultural workers are put under massive pressure and even attacked by right-wing extremist forces. We therefore defend free art and culture against anti-democrats and state interference and support them through public funding that enables artistic creativity beyond the logic of the market.
We therefore want to expand the "Creative Europe" program financially and simplify it significantly in order to facilitate cooperation and exchange between artists and cultural organizers throughout Europe. It should see itself as a service provider for cultural professionals that is approachable and provides fast and targeted support. The independent scene in particular should be given new access to strengthen European exchange, for example for ensembles and groups that work together across borders. To this end, we are also developing offers for groups that have been separated due to flight and migration.
The EU must guarantee and support the freedom of culture and its diversity. We therefore want to shape cultural funding in such a way that it is also open to those who have few own resources or no national funding.
The goal of climate neutrality is particularly relevant to the European dimension of culture, which thrives on the movement of cultural assets and people. We therefore want to create a program within the framework of Creative Europe in which advice and funding for the transformation of European cultural cooperation towards climate neutrality are bundled. We also want to further develop the idea of the New European Bauhaus, which promotes an interdisciplinary approach to climate-neutral building and design, in a participatory manner and anchor it as a separate mission in Horizon Europe.
Cross-border cultural exchange also requires unbureaucratic and fair regulations for the taxation of income from artistic activities that avoid double taxation.
The European Capitals of Culture program allows us to experience and promote the diversity of our continent. We want to continue this successful concept, but at the same time review the application procedures and make them more transparent.
European culture also includes its growing structure of independent and diverse cultural and creative industries with small and medium-sized enterprises. They create games, films, series and books, work in the design industry, the art market, the music industry, the press market, architecture, the broadcasting industry, the performing arts and the advertising market. They are key drivers of innovation and growth - far beyond their own sector. We want to promote these structures and protect them against the market power of the large international platforms, for example by advocating the preservation of the cultural exception in trade agreements. We want to strengthen the local structure of bookshops by working to ensure that price-
bound books are exempt from the rules of European public procurement law.
With the KulturPass, the federal government has introduced a new, innovative cultural policy instrument: Young people are given a budget to discover art and culture in all its diversity and breadth. In this way, we are also strengthening cultural institutions. Building on similar projects in France, Spain and Italy, we now want to introduce a joint European cultural passport so that young people can explore and discover the wealth and diversity of culture in Europe across borders.
Strengthening creativity
The creative power of artists and creatives is the basis for our vibrant cultural landscape. In the face of technological and societal changes, they must constantly reassert their place in the exploitation chain of cultural production. This applies above all to the new developments in artificial intelligence (AI). This uses images, sounds and texts created by humans togenerate new content. AI products compete with human creators. We are therefore committed to ensuring that authors can exercise their reservation of use and, where applicable, other rights vis-à-vis commercial AI simply and centrally and, where appropriate, in a machine- readable manner. Copyright law should continue to protect the creative work of natural persons and must not be extended to automatically generated content from AI systems. We want authors
to support the fair remuneration of their works
and at the same time strengthen access to knowledge and culture for all in order to create good conditions for the creatives of tomorrow. Work users as well as authors and other cultural professionals such as actors and musicians must havea seat at the table when the course of the digitalized cultural world is being negotiated. In the interest of equal opportunities, we also want to enable digital lending (e-lending) of content in the context of libraries, educational and research institutions, as has been the case to date.
By extending the Erasmus program to artists and creatives, we want to further strengthen the mobility and European perspective of cultural professionals. We want to offer a safe haven and support opportunities for cultural workers who are at risk of persecution outside the EU.
We also want to close the gender pay gap in culture. We will strengthen the role of women in the cultural sector, for example by advocating equal representation on awarding bodies and juries in the EU.
Guaranteeing media freedom
Free and democratically oriented media are an indispensable basis for the formation of public opinion. This foundation is also under attack in EU member states today. We therefore support more transparency about ownership structures and binding instruments to combat the restriction of press freedom - be it in the form of open censorship, through the control and centralization of publisher ownership or by other means. Here, too, we believe that all control mechanisms must follow the principle of independence from the state. Media freedom also means that journalists and editors can work freely within the framework of professional standards or editorial statutes. A new European body for media services must not undermine existing media rights and freedoms in Germany. In order to protect journalists and their sources from surveillance and persecution, we call for effective regulation and judicial control of the use o f	spyware. We will take action against misuse. We want to effectively protect whistleblowers from persecution.
Excessive concentration of media ownership, including in individual EU states, must be effectively prevented - if necessary by splitting up companies or ownership structures. Transparency of ownership structures is essential for this. This is the basis for a diverse press landscape that enables journalists to report freely and critically.
The economic model of private media in print and online is also severely impaired by false incentive structures in the competition for advertising revenue and the market power of social media platforms. This is threatening the existence of more and more quality media and is a pressing problem for diversity of opinion. We are therefore striving to use suitable instruments to improve the competitive situation for journalistic offerings - especially online - and to develop practicable financing instruments at member state level to strengthen journalistic content, develop sustainable business models and ensure a nationwide supply of journalistic offerings.
Where new technologies such as generative AI are used, we advocate clear labeling of AI-generated images, texts and videos.
The EU's cross-border and linguistic area poses a particular challenge for the development of a common public sphere. We therefore advocate the expansion of transnational and multilingual public service broadcasting. Specifically, we first want to expand the successful approach of the arte channel and gradually develop it into a joint European offering.
In addition, we are committed to networking the offerings of public service broadcasting in Europe and to improving findability.
European cultural and media offerings online. In this way, we want to create a fully-fledged European, public media offering in the long term, with a comprehensive and transnational offering of news, sport, culture and entertainment, for example in the form of a European media portal.
The
is also a contribution against disinformation and conspiracy myths. We want to create support and protection for media in exile so that the EU can also be a space of free expression for people from countries where freedom of the press and freedom of opinion are suppressed.
European remembrance
The memory of past injustice is one of the foundations of all societies. Europe as a continent was not only characterized by war and violence for centuries; war and violence also emanated from here for centuries. As a peace project, the EU has the task of relating these perspectives to one another. Remembrance should contribute to reconciliation and understanding, not divide. It is important to promote a multi-perspective culture of remembrance that also takes into account the history of groups that have been unjustly ignored. We want to strengthen cross-border cooperation and are committed to preserving existing places of collective remembrance, commemoration and reflection as well as creating new ones. We want to use European funds to support initiatives that are dedicated to the task of understanding and, for example, make the historically overlapping experiences of violence caused by Germany's war of aggression and the oppression by the Soviet Union understandable and comprehensible in their complex legacy in Eastern Europe. Here
This also includes cooperation with schools,
universities and cultural institutions as well as supporting civil society actors. We firmly oppose efforts to reinterpret history in the service of nationalist tendencies.
We clearly oppose all attempts to draw a "line" under the memory of the crimes of National Socialism and especially the Shoah or to make them harmless. They are incompatible with democratic values. We will not leave this unanswered - not in Germany, not in Europe, not anywhere.
The cruel history of genocide, colonialism, enslavement and exploitation in Africa, Latin America and Asia is also part of the European legacy. Even during the emergence of the European peace project, colonial violence and economic exploitation persisted. Many European states and companies were involved in these crimes, and Europe still benefits today from the dependencies created at that time.
capabilities. That is why we want to work closely with descendants, researchers and civil society initiatives from formerly colonized areas to come to terms with colonial history, including at a European level, and strive for reparations. This includes the restitution of looted art or human remains, for example, but also the promotion of educational work and the strengthening of multi- perspective historical research. The effects of colonialism o n today's societies should become more visible. To this end, we want to strengthen the remembrance policy dimension in thematically appropriate EU funding programs.
Fair play in sport
Whether it's amateur soccer or the Champions League, a bike ride or the Tour de France - sport is at the heart of Europe. Exercise and sport unites people, creates and conveys regional identities, provides a topic of conversation and contributes to the development of Europe.
to health. The focus is on the many people who volunteer in clubs and associations. We want to strengthen organizations and initiatives that are particularly committed to social cohesion, democracy and equality as well as combating exclusion and hatred. We want t o make European funding more easily accessible for them - sports organizations should also be strengthened as important civil society partners outside of Europe.
Sport can only act as a role model and unite people if it functions fairly and transparently and if clubs and associations act in accordance with the law.
Fraud, doping and corruption are diametrically opposed to its essence. We therefore want to establish an independent European agency that works with NGOs, anti-corruption experts and international investigators to ensure transparency, integrity and genuine accountability in cases of corruption and fraud in global sport.
In this way, we want to restore trust. This is also a basis for international
Major sporting events in Europe will continue to have their place. If they work with clear and reliable standards for social and ecological fairness and sustainability, they can gain a competitive advantage worldwide and set an example. We are particularly committed to the cross-border organization of sporting events that protect the climate and the environment. In this way, we make top-class European sport a shared experience.
We want to make sport resilient to the effects of the climate crisis. Many sports depend on an intact natural environment, but at the same time sport causes damage. Through a new European program, we want to show ways in which Europe's diverse sports scene can contribute to meeting climate targets and develop. Our aim is to ensure that sporting events can be held in a climate-neutral way.
5. Refugee and migration policy of humanity and order
Fighting the causes of flight
The number of people displaced by wars, the climate crisis or a lack of economic prospects has doubled worldwide in the last ten years. The vast majority of people are fleeing within their own country or to neighboring regions. However, we are also noticing the effects of the increasing numbers of refugees in Europe. We are facing up to this responsibility, because flight and migration are a historical and global reality and will remain so. The suffering that people experience on escape routes to Europe and at Europe's external borders is intolerable. The fact that people still take these routes shows how great the suffering, danger and lack of prospects are in many regions of the world.
Tightening asylum laws does not tackle the causes of migration. The policies of the EU and its members must recognize their global responsibility.
and also contribute to enabling people in their home regions to live a safe and peaceful life. By expanding reliable humanitarian aid and structure-building transitional aid in crisis regions, we can support people in acute emergencies. In this way, we help to alleviate suffering directly on the ground. With development cooperation on an equal footing and fair trade relations, we can contribute to improving people's prospects in the long term. At the same time, Europe must not close itself off, especially in the face of many crises and disasters, but must take on a fair share of the responsibility for taking in people seeking protection. We advocate the rule of law and humane treatment of people seeking protection in Europe.
Welcoming skilled workers and employees
Europe is facing demographic change with a rapidly ageing population and is desperately looking for skilled workers. In order to secure our future, we must become more attractive in the global competition for skilled workers and labor and shape immigration in a modern way. It is important to us that the interests of the countries of origin are also taken into account, as skilled workers are also needed there. Instead of bureaucratic and lengthy procedures, we want to promote the immigration of specialists and workers with different levels of qualifications with EU-wide common framework regulations. This includes making the recognition of educational qualifications from third countries uniform and unbureaucratic.
In order to recruit qualified specialists, we want to further expand the EU talent pool. This requires more staff in the European embassies and a digitalization offensive so that applications can be submitted quickly and digitally.
An active welcoming culture also makes us attractive as a business location. To achieve this, we must counter racism and exclusion. We want to create targeted integration opportunities for the various forms of migration throughout Europe. In order to offer good
and rapid integration on the ground, we want to strengthen the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). This will enable local authorities to prepare for the admission of skilled workers and their families. In addition, the rights of third- country nationals living here permanently must be protected and preserved. That is why we support an improvement of the Permanent Residence Directive in this direction. We want to promote voluntary circular migration and also train future skilled workers in Europe.
We want to protect all workers against exploitation
- including undocumented workers. Fair working conditions must not depend on origin. To this end, we want to expand multilingual and low-threshold complaint and advice structures and strengthen trade union structures so that all workers can turn to them.
Tackling common asylum policy
We are fighting for an EU that guarantees access to the human right to asylum and complies with humanitarian and international legal obligations such as the UN Refugee Convention. We are currently a long way from achieving this goal. The human rights of refugees are being violated in many places, including at Europe's borders and in EU countries, and disregard for EU law has become part of everyday asylum policy. This has not created order and structure, but more chaos and suffering. The Dublin system is unjust and does not meet the current challenges.
A long-term, orderly and fair common EU asylum policy is needed to put an end to the inhumane and chaotic conditions.
Reforms alone are not enough; existing EU law must also be enforced. We are campaigning against the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) becoming a program to dismantle refugee rights.
We want to use the scope for improvement. With a fair and binding distribution of people seeking protection, we are strengthening solidarity between the member states. Isolation and border fences create chaos and suffering, the rule of law
fair procedures, good integration offers and humane conditions ensure humanity and order.
Countries with Europe's external borders are particularly dependent on orderly distribution and support from the EU as well as solidarity in legal border management. Our goal is a binding distribution mechanism for people seeking protection. On the way there, a permanent, reliable and binding solidarity mechanism should significantly improve distribution.
In order to overcome the common challenges, all member states must get involved - whether by taking in people seeking protection or by providing financial support for the reception of refugees.
Contributions in cash or in kind to third countries are not compensation. Member States that take in refugees to a particularly large extent must be strengthened and financially relieved.
Many municipalities in the EU are prepared to take a bold approach and assume responsibility. We welcome these efforts and are committed to supporting precisely those municipalities that do not receive this support from their national governments. We would like to expand the possibility for municipalities and aid organizations to access the AMIF more directly. European networking and exchange between municipalities can help with integration. This can be seen, for example, in
the successful establishment of cross-border networks of municipalities. When it comes to the distribution of refugees at European level, we want to bring the resources of the federal states and municipalities in line with the needs of the refugees via a matching mechanism. This should take into account family backgrounds, language skills and professional qualifications, for example.
EU states that receive a disproportionately high number of refugees as a result of the application of the mass influx directive must receive fair financial support from other states, as provided for in the directive. We oppose
the so-called screening within the sovereign territory. The registration of minors must not lead to a violation of children's rights.
The mass influx directive was a good tool in dealing with the millions of refugees from Ukraine. We want to analyze the experiences of this unbureaucratic and pragmatic approach in detail and develop proposals for asylum policy.
It is unacceptable that individual member states treat refugees so badly that courts consider it unreasonable for them to remain there. Everyone has a fundamental right to be guaranteed a humane minimum standard of living. The Reception Directive ensures that people seeking protection in every Member State are guaranteed living and humane conditions, and standards based on the rule of law must be guaranteed throughout the EU. We are therefore committed to ensuring that the EU Commission and the Council use the instruments available to them to stop the abuse of EU law and the criminalization of humanitarian aid. This also includes freezing EU funds if national governments systematically break EU law. The EU Asylum Agency should support the member states, particularly in asylum procedures, and ensure that asylum applications are processed swiftly in accordance with the rule of law. It can help to prevent congestion.
Ensuring humanity and order at the external borders
The EU is an area of freedom, security and justice. The right to freedom of movement and the dismantling of borders within Europe was and is one of the greatest achievements in bringing the European community together. We therefore reject permanent and stationary internal border controls.
It goes without saying that the EU must control its external borders - and this is not just about migration. For freedom and security at home, we also need to know who is coming to Europe.
The fact that constitutional controls or reliable registration at the external borders have nothing to do with unlawful isolation against asylum seekers can be seen in the movement of refugees from Ukraine. Millions of people are reliably checked but have been able to find protection in the EU. Unfortunately, however, many other asylum seekers do not encounter constitutional controls at EU borders, but rather injustice and violence.
The credibility of European values, and therefore the influence of European policy on the outside world, requires respect for the law and values in our own actions. It is difficult to reconcile this realization with the fact that the European promise of humanity and the rule of law is shattered for thousands of people every year by barbed wire and patrol boats. We oppose violations of the rule of law, freedom of the press and human rights as well as the unlawful push-back of refugees.
People seeking protection in Europe must be reliably registered, provided with initial care and housed in a humane manner. The right to a case- by-case assessment and the principle of non- refoulement apply everywhere and at all times. The asylum applications of people who arrive in the EU or are already here must be examined in Europe. Border procedures must not lead tothe creation of further large detention camps such as Moria at the external borders, which violate the dignity and rights of people seeking protection. We oppose the disenfranchisement of people who are instrumentalized by authoritarian states.
Despite the principles enshrined in international and European law, we repeatedly experience systematic violations of the law at Europe's external borders.
People are subjected to mistreatment, denied access to the asylum procedure or denied the right to asylum.
they are abandoned to their fate in distress at sea. We are committed to ensuring that illegal pushbacks are consistently punished and sanctioned legally and politically. We also want to strengthen the EU Fundamental Rights Agency and further expand the state and civil society human rights monitoring system. An independent
Monitoring with investigative powers at the external borders should be made possible. Aid and human rights organizations as well as lawyers need access to refugees and border regions at all times. Free reporting by journalists must be guaranteed.
Cooperation between the EU and third countries must always be based on fundamental and human rights. We want to finally end cooperation with the Libyan coast guard.
Border controls at the external borders are an EU Community task that should increasingly be carried out by European officials. That is why we want to further develop Frontex in line with the rule of law. This means that Frontex must not participate in operations that violate human rights and must end such operations consistently and promptly, as provided for in the Frontex Regulation. At the same time, Frontex operations must be subject to close parliamentary scrutiny.
We are committedtoensuring that Frontex is better monitored not only by the European Parliament, but also by national parliaments. This also includes access to mission reports. It must become easier to hold Frontex accountable for violations of the law, for example through a separate liability basis.
We stand resolutely by the side of the many committed people who care for and advise refugees. The fact that refugee aid is made more difficult or even punishable in many countries is unacceptable. We want to work to ensure that support for refugees is not hindered, but made possible. We want to ensure that NGOs and lawyers have unhindered access to them in order to carry out their humanitarian work. We must pay particular attention to the needs of particularly vulnerable groups such as women, queer people, children and people with disabilities. This includes safe accommodation as well as trained counseling structures and interpreters. Voluntary counseling structures do important work, especially for vulnerable groups. We want to strengthen them through state and professional support, among other things.
Millions of children are fleeing wars, violence, hunger or political persecution alone or with their parents. We must protect them better from criminal structures. Children must be accommodated and cared for in a child-friendly manner; this applies to all children in Germany as well as at Europe's external borders. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also applies without restriction to refugee children, regardless of where they are. People must not be detained simply because they apply for asylum. Families with children should never be subject to border procedures
and Member States are not obliged to carry out border procedures.
Migration agreements, lane changes and safe returns
All people seeking protection in Europe have a right to fair asylum procedures based on the rule of law. We demand that they have access to independent asylum advice in order to know and assert their rights. Legal recourse against negative decisions must always be open.
At the same time, we know that not all asylum procedures lead to a residence permit. Anyone who has not been granted a residence permit after careful examination of the requirements under asylum and residence law and after exhausting all legal remedies must leave the country quickly - provided there are no obstacles to deportation.
Returns are always associated with particular human hardship. We want voluntary return to take precedence over forced return measures. That is why we are committed to Europe-wide, open-ended and independent return counseling.
It is also clear that people may not be deported to countries where there are reasons of human rights or international law to the contrary. People may only be returned to countries to which the person concerned has a clear connection. It must be ensured that these countries respect the rule of law when dealing with refugees. We continue to support the concept of safe third countries
wrong. The conclusion of migration agreements with countries of origin and transit must be based on human rights, and cooperation with the respective countries must be based on partnership and on an equal footing. It must not be made dependent on financial support as part of development cooperation and should also serve to combat the causes of flight. The agreements should give the population prospects and not strengthen autocratic regimes. Only comprehensive agreements can create acceptance for the agreements, repatriations and orderly and safe migration.
We don't think the concept of safe countries of origin is right because it doesn't solve any problems. What will help isto equip immigration authorities properly, speed up all asylum procedures and improve the quality of decisions. Countries that guarantee their citizens a safe return should be given the prospect of orderly migration, for example through visa facilitation or training partnerships. People who have committed serious crimes must be returned as a priority after serving their sentence.
Many refugees have been living in Europe for a long time, some of them with children born here, are contributing to society and are in employment.
We want to give them better prospects. After all, it is unreasonable for people to have to worry about deportation on a daily basis despite being deeply rooted in European society. On the contrary: we want to recognize the integration achievements and the work of these people.
We therefore advocate a change of track in the European immigration system.
Rescuing people in distress at sea
Every year, thousands of people die trying to cross the Mediterranean. As the EU, it is our duty not to close our eyes to this intolerable situation. No one should have to risk their own life or that of their family and children for the right to seek asylum. We must no longer accept that the Mediterranean remains the deadliest refugee route in the world.
International law obliges us to rescue people in distress at sea. We finally need a European initiative for a state-coordinated and financed sea rescue service.
We also want to improve state support for civilian organizations, including financial support.
Germany's entry into the financial support of private sea rescue NGOs is an important step here. We also want to continue to encourage other EU states to actively support sea rescue. We stand by the sea rescuers who save lives.
All EU Member States are responsible for ensuring that sea rescue organizations can carry out their missions safely. Sea rescue vessels must not be hindered in their work by the authorities and sea rescue must not be criminalized. The
EU Commission should resolutely oppose the criminalization of aid organizations. Rescue ships must have the opportunity to call at the nearest safe port so that people can go ashore and be cared for. The departure of rescue ships must not be hindered. In order to save human lives, we advocate the improvement of state support, including financial support, for civilian organizations. Disembarkation in countries must not take place if rescued persons are at risk of unlawful treatment there. The principle of non- refoulement applies always and everywhere.
Creating safe escape routes
We want to create safe escape routes, because this is how we protect human lives and put a stop to smuggling gangs and human trafficking. In this way, we also protect vulnerable groups who currently have few opportunities to escape.
To this end, we rely on partnership-based and human rights-based migration agreements with countries outside the EU.
We are committed to ensuring that the UNHCR's resettlement program
and strengthen it. In this way, refugees recognized by the United Nations (UN) and in need of special protection can be distributed to the host countries in an orderly manner and in a spirit of solidarity.
We want the share to be based on the economic strength of the countries. The EU resettlement must be based on the UNHCR criteria and must not weaken the individual right to asylum.
By issuing humanitarian visas, we want to ensure that people seeking protection can reach Europe without endangering their lives. As the EU, we have a particular responsibility to
responsibility towards former local forces. We also want to support people who are particularly at risk due to their commitment to democracy, women's rights or human rights. We are therefore committed to strengthening reception programs. We want to enable Afghan women who have fled to third countries and who have been banned from studying in their home country since the Taliban took power to continue their studies with a European scholarship program. We also want to promote such programs for other war and crisis zones in order to provide answers to the increasing dangers for academics and students worldwide. It is important to us to help people in danger, regardless of their citizenship, for example with European scholarship programs for students in danger.
We advocate that refugees should be able to bring their relatives home. Families belong together. At the same time, stable living conditions support integration.
6. A united approach to crime
Strengthening police cooperation
A strong area of freedom and freedom of movement needs effective institutions that protect the law and democracy, and it needs people to be able to act.
who often fulfill this mission at great personal c o s t . Crime takes place across borders and causes enormous damage - it threatens the
individual security of all people, our quality of life and our prosperity. The EU must respond to this: the increasing networking of our society and economy must also be reflected in the cooperation between our security authorities. In a united Europe, modern and effective police and judicial work must take place across borders, ensure the rapid flow of information, be in line with civil liberties and citizens' rights and comply with the rule of law.
operate according to the same standards. We focus on effective prevention, exchange of experience and joint prosecution.
We want to expand the European police authority Europol for this purpose. Europol should have its own operational capabilities for combating terrorism and organized crime (OC).
We are continuing to develop the Europol Information System (EIS) in order to improve data exchange. We are incorporating experience from police IT projects in the member states as well as the role of the judiciary. We want to strengthen the supervision of Europol by the European Parliament in order to ensure transparency. In the future, we want to establish a European Criminal Police Office.
This means that the European police authority Europol, which is currently largely free of powers, will be expanded into a European police force along the lines of the Federal Criminal Police Office with its own investigation teams. In addition to the expansion of Europol, the exchange and networking of European police forces is a key to success: we promote police cooperation by expanding joint investigation teams that work closely together to carry out investigations. The best minds are needed to fight crime successfully. That is why we want Europol and the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) to be able to recruit experts who are not seconded from the police or judicial authorities of the member states. We are expanding joint police centers in border regions at EU level.
We want to strengthen European police work in practice and theory on the basis of the rule of law and science. To this end, we are further promoting and developing exchange programs for police officers - including through the Erasmus+ program. We are strengthening cooperation and research at police colleges and universities and thus promoting a science-based crime policy. We also want to involve third countries in this, particularly with regard to the joint fight against OC and financial crime.
Fighting organized crime
Organized crime harms people across Europe. It costs taxpayers and companies billions. It can undermine democracy and the rule of law.
Examples of this include the assassination of investigative journalists, the infiltration of legal economic sectors and the exertion of political influence through corruption. In this way, the OC damages economically weak regions in Europe in particular and hinders their development. We want to take decisive and joint action against OC organizations. We are paying particular attention to groups such as the mafia. To this end, we are strengthening cross-border cooperation between the criminal police and the judiciary. We want to harmonize European laws to combat OC.
We are taking a closer look at organized white- collar crime, protecting consumers from fraud and companies from unfair competition. We want to consistently fight the various forms of human trafficking and provide special protection for the victims. One of our priorities is the fight against environmental crime and agromafia: the illegal disposal of waste, illegal logging and the trade in questionably produced food cause enormous damage to people and the environment. We will curb the trade in illicit drugs and focus on the entire production and trade chain. We are promoting cross-sector investigations in order to better combat overlaps between OC and other areas of crime such as cybercrime or terrorism.
tion. Sustainable action against criminal activities can only succeed in cooperation with civil society and must focus on prevention. We will therefore support civil society organizations that are committed to combating OC or offer exit programs for members of criminal organizations.
Fighting human trafficking comprehensively
Human trafficking in all its forms is a transnational crime and a violation of human rights. Despite existing EU legislation and obligations of EU member states under international law, the majority of cases of human trafficking are still not effectively investigated or prosecuted. There are many different forms of human trafficking. The most common form is for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Women and girls are particularly affected. Another form is
of labor exploitation and forced labor. Occupational health and safety standards are massively undermined and people are forced into exploitative working conditions. Their living conditions are catastrophic. Exploitation for criminal or degrading activities or even the illegal removal of organs is also part of human trafficking.
Victims of human trafficking need protection, their rights must be strengthened and they need help, including in overcoming the trauma they have suffered. Minors need special attention and protection. We want to strengthen access to information on victims' rights, promote enforcement and ensure good coordination between Member States, public administrations and judicial authorities. The protection of victims must be at the center of our actions. We want to protect victims in the long term through independent, permanent rights of residence and protection programs.
The EU institutions should work towards the proper implementation of the EU Trafficking in Human Beings Directive in the Member States and in doing so
in the best possible way. The member states are required to develop their own action plans for effective
The aim is to design and implement measures to combat human trafficking in order to contribute to better identification of victims and perpetrators and to an improved data situation in the future.
We forge alliances between specialist advice centres, civil society organizations and the private sector. We are committed to training staff who come into contact with victims of human trafficking or who can help to identify perpetrators. Finally, we are strengthening resolute, cross-border cooperation between the relevant law enforcement and investigative authorities in order to combat human trafficking and dismantle criminal networks.
Taking action against money laundering
Money laundering and financial crime cause great financial damage to the state and society. In Germany alone, it is estimated that around 100 billion euros are "laundered" every year. The scandal surrounding Wirecard AG has harmed many thousands of small investors. We want to take decisive action against money laundering and financial crime. We will also target organized tax and subsidy fraud.
Financial investigations often offer initial investigative approaches and can help to deprive criminal groups of their business basis. We therefore want to strengthen instruments to better track financial flows in particular and to detect money laundering and the transfer of assets. For us, one thing is clear: crime must not pay!
We want to develop the new European anti-money laundering authority AMLA into a powerful institution in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. We are pushing for all EU member states to implement European and international standards for combating money laundering at national level without delay. In developing the AMLA, we are also working closely with the private sector, for example to shed light on cryptocurrency trading and take measures. In addition, the automatic exchange of tax information is to be intensified. We are committed to ensuring that international
an anti-money laundering action plan is driven forward at G7 / G20 level. We advocate a European asset register. Authorities across Europe should be allowed to view the beneficial owners of assets that are regularly misused by criminals for money laundering.
We will further restrict loopholes and opportunities to circumvent the transparency registers used to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Access to the transparency registers should be simple, free of charge and anonymous for civil society, journalists, researchers and other groups with a legitimate interest. Real estate must be effectively protected against speculation by illegal money. This is also how we protect tenants. To this end, we will improve transparency regulations and controls on the acquisition of real estate.
We want to improve cross-border cooperation between law enforcement authorities and instruments in the area of asset recovery. It must be easier to confiscate assets of unclear origin in connection withcriminal activities. We will set EU- wide maximum limits for cash in ordertomake the transfer of incriminated funds more difficult. We will strengthen the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in terms of personnel and funding sothat it can take effective action against fraud and corruption offenses, such as the misappropriation of European funding.
Stop terrorism
Terrorist attacks or acts of violence, currently mainly motivated by Islamist and far-right extremists, cause immeasurable human suffering. They are a threat to public safety. In recent years, the cross-border networking of violent groups and actors has increased. The EU can and must make an effective contribution to protection here.
Consistent and well-coordinated police and intelligence cooperation across Europe with uniform rule of law standards and definitions is necessary,
to take action against terror. To this end, we want to upgrade the position of the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator and oblige the member states to engage in more exchange and cooperation.
Good prevention work is the best way to prevent people from slipping into the political violence scene and terrorism. To do this, we need a Europe- wide exchange of experience between democratic forces, which we want to support financially. This includes educational work in schools and youth facilities. We want to establish deradicalization programmes or offers for people leaving the Islamist or right-wing extremist scene throughout the EU. We are closely monitoring the development of other and new forms of extremism, such as the delegitimization of the state relevant to the protection of the constitution. We incorporate findings from research and science into this. Online platforms, online gaming and messengers play an important role in the spread of terrorist propaganda. We want providers of such services to take more decisive action against this and delete the relevant content.
By resolutely combating the financing of terrorism, we want to remove the operational basis for terror. We focus on where terrorist and criminal structures overlap. In this way, we are preventing access to black markets and drying up important sources of finance or making access to weapons more difficult. We are committed to common standards and an intensive exchange in the prosecution of terrorists.
When monitoring potential violent criminals, a uniform approach is needed across Europe so that the security authorities do not lose track of them for administrative reasons. We therefore want to define the term "dangerous person" in a uniform way across the EU in order to ensure that cases are processed across borders.
In the past, serious acts of violence and terrorist attacks have repeatedly shown that firearms or explosive precursors are too easily available. We want to
restrict the availability of illegal firearms and dry up the black market. We want to introduce effective European standards for so-called prima facie weapons, such as collector's items, so that reactivation of the
weapons is no longer possible. Weapons and relevant weapon parts must be fully registered. We advocate common and strict standards for background checks for gun owners. We want to prevent the misuse of explosives precursors through strict monitoring.
Setting up intelligence services effectively
Cross-border terrorism, illegal activities by foreign intelligence services, industrial espionage and disinformation campaigns threaten our liberal and open society. Authoritarian states such as China, Russia and Iran in particular, but also criminal groups, are targeting the entire EU. In some cases, they coordinate their actions in the various member states. Examples of this include the massive spread of fake news - also to influence elections -, attacks on opposition members on EU territory or on our critical infrastructures (KRITIS). We in the EU must stand together and resolutely against this. The intelligence services play an important role in this and are part of a resilient democracy.
We are calling for effective intelligence services based on the rule of law, which will enable us to better guarantee the security of the EU. Up to now, their work has often been hampered by the fact that information and intelligence cannot be shared sufficiently within the existing European structures. We therefore want to establish a European Intelligence Agency (ENA) for better cooperation between European intelligence services, which will further develop the existing European intelligence structures, both civilian and military, on a clear constitutional basis.
It is intended to make knowledge gathered in the Member States
in compliance with strict legal requirements.
to strengthen the European analysis capability. In this way, strategic and long-term security policy assessments can be made. Strong, effective and democratically legitimized mechanisms based on the rule of law are needed to control the agency, which we want to develop with the involvement of the European Parliament.
We want to cooperate more closely in the development of European IT solutions in the area of intelligence services in order to secure digital sovereignty here too. We are committed to ensuring that intelligence service powers are based on clear legal foundations throughout Europe, are appropriately limited and are subject to strong parliamentary control in all member states.
Intelligence activities and instruments must be evaluated and be in line with civil rights. We reject the unlawful sharing of questionably obtained data between intelligence services. Furthermore, we advocate better networking and cooperation between the supervisory authorities of the Member States at European level.
Expanding joint prosecution
Efficient and joint prosecution of criminal offenses requires a uniform European legal framework - this applies to the entire spectrum, from OC to hate crime. To this end, we want to further harmonize criminal law in particular. We want to include hate crime in the list of EU criminal offenses so that
it can be tracked throughout Europe. This also requires uniform Europe-wide monitoring and regular dark field and victimization studies.
In order to enforce the law in Europe, we want to strengthen European structures: we want to improve the staffing and funding of Eurojust and expand the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). In future, it should also be responsible for cross-border cases in the area of terrorism and OC. We want to simplify cross-border criminal proceedings and bundle them in one country so that they can be carried out jointly.
can be conducted. By digitizing cross-border electronic legal transactions while maintaining IT security and data protection, we are creating faster and more efficient judicial cooperation in Europe. We all have a duty to protect children from sexualized violence. This requires structural reforms as well as investments in prevention work and more staff in counseling centers and the police. Instead of monitoring all private chat and messenger messages ("chat control"), we advocate targeted measures.
The focus is on the rights of citizens: We advocate effective legal protection for defendants and defense lawyers. Whistleblowers, witnesses and investigative journalists play a key role in the investigation of criminal offenses and violations of the law.
We therefore want to protect them better. To this end, we are proposing an EU network that offers effective protection across Europe for people involved in the detection and prosecution of criminal offenses. All this should help people to cooperate safely with the justice system in solving crimes. We want to make use of this. In future, the testimony of key witnesses should play a greater role in cross-border prosecutions.
Protecting the population
Natural disasters, serious accidents or humanitarian emergencies: extraordinary emergency situations can turn the lives of thousands of people u p s i d e d o w n and cause enormous environmental damage. Attacks on our critical infrastructure can also have incalculable consequences. They are the lifelines of our modern society. They supply us with
energy or information. Individual member states are quickly o v e r w h e l m e d by threats of this magnitude. The EU can provide practical help through its own resources and coordination - and thus protect security and prosperity on our continent.
We want to improve and combine the physical and digital protection of KRITIS.
We are taking transnational networks more strongly into
the view. We are introducing a mandatory IT vulnerability management system to prevent attacks on digital systems.
The climate crisis threatens to further increase extreme weather events with their sometimes unforeseeable consequences. Strengthening European civil protection can help to reduce damage. We want to further strengthen the European Civil Protection Mechanism and equip it with its own European capabilities. To this end, we initially want to set up a genuine E u r o p e a n fire-fighting aircraft squadron and integrate it into the rescEU reserve. In order to better protect the population and vulnerable groups in particular from extreme heatwaves, we want to support the member states in developing joint heat protection concepts. Europe also needs better preparation for transnational disasters. That is why we want to develop joint plans for risk prevention and management at
and think along with them across all planning
processes. We want to expand population health protection and, for example, capacities to provide assistance in the event of earthquakes or other major emergencies.
7. Digital civil rights
Safeguarding human rights in a digital world
Rapidly advancing digitalization has anenormous impact on theway we live together. That is why we are developing a human rights policy for the digital age based on our values. We want to strengthen the EU as a role model and partner for the rule of law and human rights in a globalized digital world. To this end, we must always consider people's rights when shaping the digital dimension. People have the right to live a self-determined life and not to be taken over by AI or other technologies.
We advocate that the digital space should better reflect our diverse society and that existing discrimination should not be transferred to the digital space.
is transferred. We promote consistent action against discrimination and the active participation of women in shaping digitalization. We want to strengthen the international legal framework for the digital space and be guided by the model of a free, open, global and secure internet.
We therefore reject instruments of mass surveillance. These include, for example, the unprovoked retention of pri- vate data or chat control, biometric facial recognition and the monitoring of behavior or emotions. In particular, we reject AI-supported technologies for the recognition of emotions or the attribution of sometimes highly personal characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, political or trade union affiliation, also due to the potential impact on already marginalized groups. However, research and the use of emotion recognition in particular to provide support in the medical and social fields should not be affected by this. We want to strengthen and expand the right to digital privacy, secure communication and end-to-end encryption. We want to protect the anonymous use of the internet. Particular attention should be paid to ease of use by users. This is particularly important for free press reporting or for the work of opposition forces in authoritarian countries.
We clearly oppose the processing of comprehensive passenger data without cause and the expansion of corresponding systems to other sectors. Spyware is also used in the EU, which deeply invades privacy. We want to regulate the use of spyware more strictly and strengthen parliamentary oversight. Stronger action must be taken against misuse, for example to monitor journalists or public prosecutors.
Not everyone has the opportunity to make full use of digital services. Even though digitalization is advancing at a rapid pace, we are committed to ensuring that services that are necessary for participation in society are available to everyone.
The same applies to all other services that are necessary, such as doctors, authorities, banks or local publictransport, which remain accessible without additional costs.
Tackling hate and disinformation online
Access to reliable information and news is a prerequisite for democracy. Today, social media and other modern communication platforms make it possible for information and news to be prepared and discussed in a wide variety of ways.
Propaganda campaigns jeopardize the democratic formation of opinion. Elections and other opinion-forming processes as well as trust in our democratic institutions are being deliberately undermined by means of disinformation.
be influenced. We are resolutely opposed to this, for example with measures to strengthen media competence or the promotion of fact-checking platforms. We want to examine the possible inclusion of systematic disinformation in the catalog of EU criminal offenses. We also advocate theconsistent enforcement of sanctions against propaganda platforms that deliberately spread disinformation, such as Russia Today. We want regular, Europe-wide situation reports on disinformation to be drawn up in order to create the basis for an effective fight against it.
Hate, incitement and disinformation are deliberately attacking open debate in these places. Open misogyny is used in an attempt to force women out of the digital space. The instruments for combating violence against women as well as hate and incitement to hatred must be applied consistently. Stronger action must be taken against the publication of nude images without the consent of those affected. Algorithms and targeting on dominant digital platforms make a significant contribution to this byincreasing the spread of hate messages and disinformation. As a result, people affected by hate speech often withdraw or restrict their expression of opinion - to the detriment of democratic debate.
We are targeting the algorithmic amplification of hate and hate speech. Hate speech must be deleted consistently and accounts spreading it must be blocked. We are committed to fast and simple procedures. With the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we have laid the foundations in Europe for countering hate speech with user rights, transparency and clear rules, creating a more democratic internet and restoring competition. These rules must now be consistently enforced and further developed in Germany and Europe. Hate and disinformation must not be a profitable business model. We want to examine measures to dry up such business models, for example by skimming off the profits generated by them.
Civil society organizations must be able to support people affected by hate and hate speech more easily in exercising their rights. To this end, we also want a Europe-wide
Establish victim counseling and low-threshold offers of help. Civil society organizations should be allowed to represent victims in proceedings or take action on their own initiative in cases of incitement to hatred.
We want to support the establishment of special units within the police and public prosecutor's offices in the member states. The consistent enforcement of criminal law can also be supported by the legally secured automated detection of criminally relevant material, such as hate posts, which is then checked by the investigating authorities. Euro- pol should take action against Europe-wide networks that specifically spread hate and hate speech online.
At the same time, traditional media can also play an important role in the spread of disinformation if, for example, they take information from social media without verification or even actively contribute to the spread of misinformation themselves. The dissemination of high-quality fake videos, so-called deepfakes, or AI-manipulated
Images make disinformation appear even more credible and are difficult for many people to recognize. This is why we have successfully anchored the adequate labeling of deepfakes in the AI Act. An important building block in the fight against disinformation in a democracy lies in strengthening information literacy so that people can better recognize disinformation.
So-called social bots, which automatically distribute content on social media, must be labeled accordingly and thus be distinguishable from human users.
Protecting Europe's IT
As our digital infrastructure plays an increasingly important role in our coexistence, its protection is of great importance. However, the best protection against cybercrime lies in the prevention and resilience of digital systems. We ensure that high IT security requirements are consistently established in digital products, services and processes. We are committed to the swift implementation of the updated EU directive on cyber security in order to establish an EU-wide level of security. In order to make the security of IT products transparent for consumers and increase the level of IT security in the private sector, we want to examine the introduction of an IT security label at European level. We want to strengthen European cooperation in the area of cyber security.
security and are committed to a common
European security architecture. We are further developing the European Union Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA), the work of the European Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ICAC) and the foreign policy instrument of the "Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox" for this purpose.
Cyberspace is increasingly becoming the scene of wars and conflicts. We can see this clearly in Ukraine, where Russia's military aggression is being accompanied by cyber operations.
Cyberattacks, for example on digital electoral and administrative systems, are also a threat to our democracy and security. We are committed to
a norm- and rule-based cyberspace characterized by diplomacy and international cooperation. At the same time, cyber security goes hand in hand with digital sovereignty. We want to expand competencies in the EU in this area.
We want to create the legal and technical framework for secure "digital embassies" in Europe. This should enable state and publicly relevant databases and technical infrastructures in other European member states to be kept secure in ordertoenablethe ability to work and access to data, for example from parliaments, public administration, the judiciary or social insurance, even in crisis and war situations.
The rapid pace of digitalization and the increase in digital services have also led to a shift of crimes to the internet. Law enforcement must respond to this, especially at a European level, because cybercrime, like the internet, knows no borders.
To this end, we are strengthening Europol's role in the fight against online crime. We are also strengthening Europe-wide police cooperation to detect and combat crime. We are also taking decisive action against the spread of sexualized violence against children and young people online by strengthening the investigative authorities in terms of personnel, technology and procedural law. To this end, we also want to use the possibility of automated applications to support investigations. We want to use targeted campaigns to raise citizens' awareness of fraudulent crimes that are committed online.

Preamble
¦ Rethinking Europe
Since its foundation, the Alternative for Germany has stood by the idea of a Europe of fatherlands, a European community of sovereign, democratic states that work together for the benefit of their citizens in all those tasks that can be better accomplished together.
The EU and its supporting elites abandoned the founding fathers' original idea of a European community many years ago. They are continuously eroding the sovereignty of nation states and striving for an EU superstate. Such an entity has neither a nation nor the necessary minimum level of cultural identity, which are essential prerequisites for successful, democratically constituted states.
The complete failure of the EU in all areas that affect Europe's existence is exemplified by the negligently induced migration crisis. Although the protection of Europe's external borders is one of the EU's essential tasks, it is standing idly by in the face of illegal mass immigration organized by criminal smuggling gangs. Borders must once again be understood for what they are: as protection against attack and appropriation, as a distinction between one's own and foreigners, as a prerequisite for sovereign statehood.
Another misguided development can be seen in climate and energy policy. The dogma of man-made climate change serves as a pretext for the EU to intervene and regulate all areas of life. EU programs such as the "Green Deal" and "Fit for 55" are having a destructive effect on the European and, in particular, the German economy. None of these measures will have any impact on the global climate in the foreseeable future.
We consider the idea of a single currency for countries with completely different economic development and structures to be a failure. It is a political wishful thinking that cannot be reconciled with economic laws. The resulting high inflation leads to the creeping disenfranchisement of citizens.
As an economic and export nation, Germany is catastrophically affected by the EU's sanctions policy. We reject any dominance of non-European superpowers in European foreign and security policy. The states of Europe are thus drawn into conflicts that are not their own and are diametrically opposed to their natural interests - fruitful trade relations in the European-Asian region. It is therefore necessary for Europe to gradually take its defense capabilities into its own hands. A defensible Germany is indispensable for our sovereignty and security in a fundamentally changing world. The passivity of the German government after the Nord Stream pipelines were blown up shows the extent to which a large European state is giving up on itself. Supplying weapons to war zones does not serve peace in Europe either.
All crises since 2008 - the global financial crisis, euro crisis, migration crisis, corona crisis, energy crisis, inflation crisis and the alleged climate crisis - have been used to drive forward the EU's statehood, supported by the European Court of Justice and an autocratic bureaucracy. Their determination was demonstrated not least by the fact that, "if necessary", they even violated treaty principles on the functioning of the EU, such as the ban on liability for foreign debt (Art. 125 TFEU) and the ban on borrowing to finance the EU budget (Art. 311 TFEU).
We believe that the EU cannot be reformed and see it as a failed project. We therefore strive for a "Confederation of European Nations", a newly founded European economic and interest grouping in which the sovereignty of the member states is safeguarded. The welfare of Germany and its citizens is our top priority.
We consider (1) a common market, (2) the effective protection of external borders against illegal immigration, (3) the attainment of strategic autonomy in security policy action and (4) the preservation of European culture and its various identities to be the central common interests of this alliance. Resting on these pillars, the member states can autonomously and flexibly conclude functional bilateral or multilateral treaties according to their needs. Peace and a balance of interests must be at the heart of this. "Unity and strength on the outside - national diversity on the inside" is our formula for the European pole in the emerging multipolar world order.
A Europe of nations
¦ The EU is an undemocratic and unreformable construftt
The EU is undemocratic because the European Parliament is not elected according to the original democratic principle of equal voting weight for each voter. Instead, Art. 14 para. 2 sentence 3 TEU stipulates a "degressively proportional" election mode, which leads to large differences in the weight of votes within the electorate. The smaller the country, the greater the weight of the individual vote.
The Council, as the most important legislative body of the EU, consists of members who are also members of national executive bodies. This also represents a violation of a fundamental principle of any democracy, namely the separation of powers.
The European Court of Justice uses the "doctrine of the primacy of Union law" to arbitrarily override the constitutions and constitutional courts of the Member States. There is no basis for this in the treaties. Moreover, it sees itself as a driver of integration and not just as a mediator in disputes.
Our criticism of the EU's democratic deficits illustrates that the EU is failing to meet the democratic standards it has set itself and that only the nation state can be an authentic source of democracy. However, even if the EU were to succeed in remedying its democratic deficit, this would not solve the fundamental problem. Irrespective of democratic deficits, the EU is increasingly developing into a European federal state in which the individual member states are degraded to mere constituent states without their own sovereignty. The only way to counter this is a consistent return to the principle of unanimity between the member states.
All measures of the so-called euro rescue violate the treaty prohibition of credit financing of EU states according to Art. 123 TFEU and the treaty prohibition of aid ("no bail out" clause) of Art. 125 TFEU - as happened with the debt relief and financial aid for Greece in 2012 and the unconditional distribution of money to all EU states from the EU budget in 2022 according to the "Reconstruction Program for Europe" (NextGenerationEU). Their repayment will be disproportionately imposed on the net payers among the euro member states, which have received disproportionately low funding.
While the single market in the EEC prospered and created prosperity for all participating states, under the EU regime international competitiveness is increasingly being strangled by over-regulation of the EU and the common currency of the eurozone.
S	D
¦ The EU project has failed
The EU has developed into an undemocratic construct that is attracting more and more power to itself and is governed by a non-transparent, unchecked bureaucracy.
The Schengen, Maastricht and Lisbon treaties have undermined the principle of popular sovereignty. The attempt to dissolve functioning democratic nation states and replace them with a kind of European superstate is doomed to failure. The diversity of European cultures and languages is the result of centuries of historical developments. It is a source of identity for us all. It is illusory to want to replace national identities with a "European identity". There is no such thing as a European nation, which would be a basic prerequisite for such a project, nor are there any signs that such a nation will emerge. The widely differing national languages alone prevent this.
We reject an EU that wants to become a state with legislative powers and its own government, as well as the idea of a "United States of Europe". Only in nation states with a democratic constitution can the sovereignty of the people and the fundamental rights of citizens be lived and preserved.
As the EU cannot be reformed in line with the AfD, we advocate the reestablishment of a European
economic and interest community.
¦ A federation of European nations
The peoples of Europe are bound together by a shared history and their orientation towards common humanitarian values of coexistence. In particular, Greek philosophy, Roman law, Christianity and the Enlightenment have had a formative effect on all European peoples. This also includes the separation of spiritual and secular power as well as the free development of science and art, which have formed the basis for Europe's leading role in the world since the beginning of the modern era.
In view of the fact that the EU cannot be reformed, we advocate the establishment of a federation of European nations. The AfD believes that the decision on a new form of coexistence of the peoples of Europe in Germany should only be made by referendum.
Freedom and self-determination of the member states
Any restriction of the sovereignty of each European state by the interests of the newly created community is ruled out, as is the establishment of community norms that take precedence over national constitutions. In principle, freedom of contract should apply to every state and every individual policy area on the basis of international law with a regulated right of withdrawal. This ensures that treaties are only concluded and continue to exist as long as they are beneficial to all contracting parties and do not unreasonably and permanently restrict their sovereignty.
Transparency is also the top priority for government activities in all intergovernmental agreements. Every citizen has the right to full information.
Interstate disputes are to be settled by a court whose judges are delegated by the national constitutional courts.
Single market with Destination country principle
We are committed to the social market economy, the common market, the customs union and a common trade policy. The Community guarantees unrestricted reciprocal market access. Immigration into the social systems is effectively prevented. Structurally identical countries can retain or create a common currency.
A common external border protection: Fortress Europe
Mass immigration must be stopped in order to protect European nations and cultures. The protection of Europe's external borders is the first and most important Community task. It includes the construction of physical barriers, technical surveillance and the deployment of border guards. Implementation is delegated to national authorities on the basis of multilateral treaties.
¦ The path to a union of European nations
A primary goal of the AfD in the existing EU Parliament is to win over parties from all countries for the future project of a new European economic and interest community in the upcoming election period. Together with them, we want to concretize our ideas.
As long as the misconstruction of the EU continues, we will work to prevent further restrictions on national sovereignty and further redistribution of our citizens' wealth and assets through EU regulations.
Referendums on the EU at Federal level
There must be no treaties in Germany regarding EU enlargement and the granting of sovereign rights and liability commitments without a referendum. It is the self-evident right of every people in the European Union to vote on remaining in the EU, monetary union and other supranational projects. This right has been denied to us in Germany by the parties that have been in power for decades.
Abolish the EU Parliament
We want to abolish the undemocratically elected EU Parliament. Until the situation is reorganized, legislative competence will be transferred solely to the Council, whose members must, however, be bound by the decisions of the national parliaments in their voting behavior.
¦ The EU - centralism and bureaucracy
Europe's leading political decision-makers have bloated the European Union into a monstrous bureaucracy and administrative apparatus: twelve EU institutions with more than 32,000 employees, personnel costs of over eight billion euros, 25 EU agencies with a publicly unknown number of employees and legions of service providers such as interpreters and experts. MEPs, commissioners, civil servants and other EU employees receive inappropriately high salaries and excessive pension entitlements, including tax-free allowances. In the EU, for example, around 4,000 EU officials earn more than the German Federal Chancellor ( 290,000 gross/year), the head of government of the largest EU member state.
Until a new European economic and interest community is founded, we will support any reduction in the administrative apparatus. The funding of European parties and their foundations from taxpayers' money must be stopped.
Lobbying, corruption and enrichment
Due to the lack of proximity to citizens, the lack of transparency of the EU institutions, their far-reaching regulatory power and their decisions on huge amounts of money, a machinery of representatives with more than 25,000 lobbyists has spread throughout the EU. The influence on the Brussels bureaucracy is intensive and uncontrollably shameless; sometimes EU legal acts are drafted directly by the lobbyists. The measures taken to regulate lobbying following countless scandals are inadequate and largely ineffective. We are therefore calling for a mandatory lobby register in which all contact with lobbyists is published promptly and in full.
Information and Transparency
While lobbyists and interest representatives are informed comprehensively and in advance, citizens are generally denied information from the EU institutions. In negotiations on trade agreements such as TTIP, even the democratically elected representatives of the nation states were kept in the dark. That is why we are calling for an unrestricted right to information for all citizens and maximum transparency through mandatory publication of all data generated in the EU institutions along the lines of the Hamburg Transparency Act. All privileges for lobbyists must be abolished. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) must publish an annual report detailing their financial sources and activities.
Bodies that serve to circumvent democracy, such as a "Conference for the Future of Europe",
We as the AfD reject "citizens' councils" and the like! These are simulations of democracy that are intended to conceal the existing democratic deficits.
Fundamentalist Islam - a danger for Europe
We want to preserve Europe in the spirit of freedom and with its democratic values for us and our descendants in the long term. We defend Europe against a social regression caused by fundamentalist Islam, whose rules of life from the Koran and Sunnah cannot be reconciled with the basic European principles of law, freedom and democracy. Fundamentalist Islam, which is still valid today, sees itself not only as a religion, but also as the only authoritative legal and social order that wants to enforce its claim to rule over all people by means of Sharia law. This Islam makes no distinction between state and religion. Sharia law regulates not only the private lives of Muslims, but also all areas of social coexistence. In contrast, the legal systems of European countries provide for unrestricted freedom of faith, conscience and religion, as enshrined in the Basic Law's catalog of fundamental rights (Art. 4). Freedom of religion is alien to fundamentalist Islam. Islam sees itself as the only valid religion on earth to which all people must be converted. Turning away from Islam (apostasy) is punishable under Islamic law.
Since the 1960s, more and more migrants have gradually arrived in Germany and Europe, particularly from Islamic countries. This trend has continued to accelerate over the past twenty years and has taken on enormous proportions since 2015. In many countries of the European Union, such as Sweden (Malmö) with its extremely liberal immigration policy, France (Parisian banlieue, Marseille) with its former colonies on the African continent or Brussels (Molenbeek), this has led to unsolvable integration problems in the form of ghettoization.
and rampant crime. In some countries, such as France, Belgium and the Netherlands, entire districts are already inhabited by Islamic immigrants. The native population has been almost completely displaced. Such a development, which prevents the integration processes necessary for coexistence, must be avoided.
Immigration to EU countries must be subject to strict rules and massively restricted. Unequal legal and social treatment of men and women cannot be tolerated in our liberal democratic states. Child marriages, polygamy and forced marriages under Islamic law are not compatible with our legal system. This also applies to ritual genital mutilation. The applicable criminal law must be consistently enforced. Following the French model, the full veiling of women in public should be banned.
¦ Recognizing Muslim anti-Semitism and combating it
The romanticized glorification of immigration often obscures the newly emerging anti-Semitism in Europe, which has its roots in Islam. We therefore call for the social ostracism of all forms of anti-Semitism - even if the perpetrators are to be found in the left-wing or Muslim milieu.
Preserving the identity of nations
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union postulates "respect for the diversity of cultures and traditions of the peoples of Europe and for the national identities of the Member States". In direct contrast to this political promise, we have been experiencing an asylum and migration policy in Europe for years that has led to massive social upheaval. The rifts are getting deeper and deeper. The EU community of states currently lacks a common political will to adequately analyze the migration issue, in particular to assess its long-term effects and to develop political strategies on this basis. The German government's migration policy has further increased Germany's magnetic effect on uncontrolled and illegal migration. This contributes significantly to the fact that the criminal smuggling business cannot be brought under control and that there is rampant immigration, particularly into the German social system.
The German government's stance is turning Germany's loss of control into a permanent state of affairs, which is overburdening the federal government, the federal states and local authorities financially, logistically, in terms of support and security policy. One of the main reasons for this is the continuing inadequate protection of the EU's external borders. In order to preserve the positive aspects of the Schengen area, Germany must abandon its pseudo-moral arrogance and initiate results-oriented political processes on this fateful issue within the EU. The AfD supports a migration policy that brings about a turnaround. This includes, in particular, effective external border protection that prevents illegal entry. Immigration to Europe must be managed in such a way that the peace and identity of the European cultural area and its nations are preserved.
¦ National sovereignty in asylum and immigration policy
Only the national parliaments have the necessary democratic legitimacy to decide on the type and scope of immigration, which is an existential issue for a community. The self-determination of the EU member states in asylum and immigration policy must therefore be restored.
The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) must be removed from the European Treaty (TFEU) and responsibility for asylum and immigration policy returned to the nation states. This would be a situation similar to that which already exists in Denmark today.
Preventing migration from crisis regions must focus on local aid in order to enable as many people as possible to find refuge close to home and remove the incentive for dangerous journeys. Strict border protection is required, combined with the rejection of illegal migrants - as far as possible at the EU's external borders, if necessary at the German border. If asylum seekers reach Germany despite border protection, their asylum procedures must be carried out in a third country that is prepared to do so, where they will also be accepted if they are actually in need of protection ("Rwanda model"). For humanitarian reasons, we support the voluntary and exclusively temporary admission of a sovereignly determined number of particularly vulnerable persons, for example in the course of medical care for children, as a further option. At the same time, we would like to point out that we are only in favor of such humanitarian admissions and that they can only be communicated to citizens once Germany's massively overstretched financial, material and cultural reception capacities have recovered. The indispensable prerequisites for such a recovery are consistent action against illegal migration and a tight restriction and control of legal migration. Internationally, we are focusing on increased cooperation in the care of genuine refugees close to home and the establishment of local protection centers. We reject international regulations and obligations to take in people willing to migrate - as provided for in the UN migration pact and the UN refugee pact.
In coping with the flight from Ukraine, the approach of granting protection close to home, i.e. granting temporary refuge to Ukrainian war refugees in Europe, has proven its worth. Germany's resources are exhausted after taking in one million Ukrainians, which is why the Ukrainians who are still fleeing must be forwarded to the countries in Europe that have been far less affected to date on the basis of the solidarity mechanism anchored in the Mass Influx Directive. In addition, third-country nationals arriving via Ukraine must be immediately returned to their home countries if this is safely possible.
¦ Protection from criminals and dangerous individuals is indispensable
The right to life and limb of people in Germany must be given higher priority than the protection of criminals and terrorists from deportation to countries with a difficult security situation. Numerous acts of violence and homicides in recent years could have been avoided by the timely deportation of criminals. If criminals cannot be deported to their countries of origin, they should be transferred to third countries that are willing to accept them.
¦ End Germany's loss of control
Germany is a migration magnet in the middle of Europe due to the very high social benefits compared to other European countries, even for rejected asylum seekers who are obliged to leave the country. In addition, there is a lack of willingness to repatriate and regulations on the right to stay, which overall lead to a consolidation of residence for those obliged to leave the country and to later naturalization. As a result of this political failure, Germany has for years recorded a similar number of asylum seekers as the classic immigration countries Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the USA combined. By unconditionally accepting illegal secondary migration via other EU states, Germany has taken on an outsider's role in other European countries. We will put an end to this fatal policy. In particular, we will stop all
Abolish the right to stay for those obliged to leave the country. In addition, recognized asylum seekers must not automatically be granted permanent residence and German citizenship. As soon as it is possible to return to a country of origin, this must be enforced. We will put an end to the unreflected and unrestricted German "welcome culture" - similar to Sweden, Denmark or Great Britain!
¦ Amendment of the Schengen Agreement
Due to the lack of external border security, there is still an uncontrolled influx of foreigners entering the country illegally. The "borderless Europe" created by the Schengen Agreement increasingly poses a threat to the internal security of individual nation states and creates considerable risks not only in the area of terrorism, but also with regard t o organized and gang crime. Internationally active gangs of burglars and robbers make use of this "freedom", as do people and drug traffickers. In Germany alone, there has been a significant increase in all forms of organized crime; the same applies to violent crime.
Cross-border and migration-related crime is reflected in the official statistics. For example, more than 65,000 cases of domestic burglary were reported nationwide in 2022 - an increase of 21.5% compared to the previous year. So-called knife attacks have also reached a high level: in Berlin alone, more than 3,300 attacks involving the use of a knife were recorded in 2022; of the cases solved, more than half were committed by foreign suspects.
The existing options for refusing entry to criminals and sending them back must be intensified. However, this requires consistent and effective border controls. Temporarily introduced border controls, for example, have yielded corresponding successes: for example, more than 400 arrest warrants were executed during the G7 summit in 2022.
The Schengen Agreement therefore requires a comprehensive reform so that the sovereign nation states can once again guarantee their own internal security through efficient border protection. This also includes the consistent rejection of so-called economic migrants at the Schengen external borders by an appropriately equipped and jointly financed Frontex unit.
As a result, the AfD is striving for dual border protection. This means that the external borders of the Schengen area and the European Union are protected jointly by the community of states, but that the individual member states are also allowed to carry out border controls on their own initiative and take other proportional measures to prevent illegal migration at their own national borders in accordance with the rule of law.
¦ Internal security and justice are national tasks
For years, the EU has arrogated to itself competences that are reserved for nation states under the EU treaties, including in the areas of police and justice. For example, the European Public Prosecutor's Office was established alongside the existing authorities Europol and Eurojust.
The effective police cooperation between Germany and Switzerland on the basis of the German-Swiss police treaty, for example, shows that there is another way. That is why we are focusing on a substantial and practical facilitation of all mutual legal assistance traffic through inter-
state agreements. Otherwise, there is a risk of a further transfer of sovereign powers from the nation states to the EU level. We oppose this as well as the creation of supranational authorities.
We clearly reject any restriction of the sovereignty of nation states through EU legislation, including in the area of internal security.
¦ Fending off Islamist terrorist potential and combating
The open Schengen borders in conjunction with inadequate EU external border protection make it difficult to clearly identify illegal immigrants. Mass immigration has led to Islamist radicalization tendencies becoming a comprehensive security problem. In Germany alone, a total of 28,290 people were registered in 2021 who are classified as "Islamism/Islamist terrorism".
Terrorist attacks across Europe in recent years have shown that the likelihood of new attacks remains very high. It is therefore of the utmost importance in terms of security policy to ensure an intensive exchange of information with regard to dangerous individuals in Europe. In order to be able to counter this threat situation in the long term, we call for the closest possible cooperation between European security authorities in addition to combating parallel societies. The ideological radicalization of children has become an important security issue in the EU. Children from Muslim fundamentalist homes in particular are at the mercy of radical ideologues who repeatedly call for violence in religious sermons. The EU member states have a responsibility to protect children and young people from indoctrination.
¦ Fortress Europe
To protect our freedom, our way of life and our identity, irregular and illegal mass immigration to Europe from culturally unfamiliar regions must be stopped.
The protection of the external borders of the European Union is seen as the responsibility of all Member States. It includes the construction of effective physical barriers, modern technical surveillance and the deployment of border guards. It is carried out by national authorities in cooperation with the Federal Border and Coast Guard Agency.
All costs associated with the protection of external borders are borne by the Community. The national authorities of the border states may request the assistance of authorities from other Member States in crisis situations. In this case, federal and state police forces support other Member States in controlling their external borders. They then act as support for the police and border guards of the respective state. The border states are also authorized to call in technical and personnel support from their armed forces (military) to carry out border protection.
Third countries whose airlines are unable or unwilling to guarantee correct and complete checks on the entry credentials of passengers with European destinations will be excluded from flying to these destinations. Entry controls at international airports on the territory of the European Union are to be tightened, passengers without entry authorization will be returned to their departure airport without exception and on the next flight.
On the seas, smugglers' boats are escorted back to their ports of origin or the nearest non-European ports without exception. Temporary transfers of persons to coast guard vessels only take place in exceptional cases to avert an imminent danger to the life and limb of migrants and must under no circumstances result in the entry of migrants into Europe. The effective protection of its external borders is a visible and tangible expression of the constitution and demarcation of the European pole in the multipolar world order. It makes it unmistakably clear: this is where Europe begins and this is where Europe decides who gets access.
¦ The future role of the EU: supporting Member States in border management, repatriation and assistance on the ground
In future, the role of the EU institutions in migration policy should focus on practical and formal assistance in the implementation of external border protection and deportations, as well as diplomatic negotiations on repatriation agreements, in strict compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. In order to finance effective border protection facilities, the EU's investments must be significantly increased. On the other hand, the temporary practice of the European border protection agency Frontex of indirectly providing assistance to smuggling gangs should be rejected. It turns the idea of border protection into its opposite. We want to restrict development aid, the issuing of visas, access to the European labor market and market access to the EU to those states that take back people who are obliged to leave the country.
¦ Remigration instead of talent recruitment
The millions of young people from developing countries in Africa and the Middle East being admitted to Europe are depriving the countries of origin of those high performers who are urgently needed there for development and reconstruction (so-called "brain drain"). Due to the high standard of living in this country, the drive to contribute to the development of the country of origin is often lost. This creates a vicious circle of even greater impoverishment; uncontrolled emigration from these countries is therefore itself a cause of further migration movements.
As soon as peace is restored in most areas of a country of origin, the EU or Germany must immediately negotiate the conditions for the return of asylum seekers who have been accepted here and enforce this return consistently. Protection from the consequences of war should only be granted for the duration of the war and must not lead to permanent immigration. The order of the day is not "resettlement", i.e. resettlement programs to Europe, but the opposite: remigration programs must be established and expanded at national and European level.
¦ Border protection is Citizen protection
The incompatibility of Schengen and Dublin also leads to the dysfunctionality of the European asylum system, as migrants cross open borders in the Schengen area unhindered and thus reach Germany from the EU countries of first entry. Notification of the German internal border to the EU Commission is therefore necessary until German sovereignty over our borders is restored. This is the only way that the Federal Police can act as a border protection authority, as the EU internal border would then become an external border and the Federal Police would become a border authority. Detention centers to be set up near the border would serve to secure measures to end residence in the event of inadmissible applications for protection. In this way, unauthorized persons would not be allowed to enter the country in the first place. This would eliminate time-consuming and cost-intensive administrative and
1C	17
Legal proceedings that have been putting a huge strain on the administrative authorities, the courts and all security forces for years.
¦ EU freedom of movement: reduce privileges - end abuse
The EU Freedom of Movement Directive grants EU citizens in Germany a legal status that is almost completely equivalent to that of German nationals. This legal provision has led to massive migration movements within the EU from poorer to richer countries. We demand that poverty migration into the national social systems be prevented more consistently than in the past, including at EU level. Against this backdrop, the criteria for the free movement of workers within the EU must be tightened.
EU citizens who are a permanent financial burden on another EU country or who commit serious crimes must be able to be easily and permanently expelled from the country. In addition, all EU countries must be given the opportunity to make entitlement to tax-financed social benefits dependent on at least ten years of continuous employment subject to social insurance contributions without state subsidies. In order to make the Western Balkans an important part of Europe, the AfD advocates a privileged partnership with the countries of this region. Migration via these states must be contained through close security cooperation. The AfD rejects the admission of these states to the EU, but supports the formation of self-determined economic associations on the ground, such as the "Open Balkans" initiative.
¦ Defense against migration as a means of hybrid warfare
In recent years, migration movements have been used specifically as a means of hybrid warfare and for the purpose of political blackmail. For this reason, fixed border facilities must be set up at the external border, the costs of which must be borne by the international community. Airlines involved in the transportation of illegal migrants should have their landing rights in the EU revoked. Countries that deliberately turn themselves into hubs for illegal migration should be deprived of all financial support. In addition, a visa requirement should be introduced for entry into the EU.
¦ Control instead of Human trafficking
Criminal trafficking gangs are also supported by the work of so-called non-governmental organizations (NGOs), often from Germany. Their business model leads to people risking their lives in the dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean. The AfD is committed to consistently combating these inhumane activities. The smuggling of third-country nationals into the EU by non-governmental organizations must be prohibited as a serious criminal offence in the future. People rescued from distress at sea must be brought to their ports of origin or the nearest non-European port. This requires a visible signal from all EU states that illegal entry via the Mediterranean must not lead to a right to stay in Europe. We want to launch broad-based information campaigns, financed by the EU, to draw attention to the dangers and hopelessness of a crossing.
¦ Qualified immigration based on the Japanese model
The emigration of domestic, mostly highly qualified workers should be prevented as far as possible. Instead of such emigration, we need recovery programs for expatriate Germans
top performers. Technological solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and digitalization, which can replace human labour, or economic productivity increases also have priority over immigration. In the case of unskilled workers, it is primarily those who are able to work and already live in Germany today who need to be qualified. In addition, there are workers who come to Germany within the framework of the EU free movement of workers, ana logical regulations with the EFTA countries or the Western Balkans regulation. A priority check must be carried out in future as part of the Western Balkans regulation. We reject an extension to other countries, such as the Maghreb states, as well as the immigration of unskilled workers from third countries.
With regard to skilled workers, we will introduce a strict priority and alternative test. First of all, it is imperative that domestic potential and the European labor market are exploited. For non-European skilled workers, the immigration law for skilled workers must be reformed in line with the "Japanese model". As part of a selection process, we will introduce a points system with clear selection criteria, such as sufficient language skills, combined with an annual determination of sectors and quotas by the federal government, depending on the economic situation and the situation on the labor market. For highly qualified non- European applicants, we want to further develop the proven instrument of the EU Blue Card and in future target experts in the STEM professions (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in particular.
Monetary policy: the euro has failed
¦ Back to justice, prosperity and social peace in Europe through the reintroduction of national currencies
The AfD advocates a monetary policy based on a market economy, national responsibility and friendly cooperation between European states. The creeping transformation of the European union of states into a centralized EU state, which has been progressing for 30 years, has never been democratically legitimized by the European peoples. The euro does not have the institutional basis that would be a constitutional prerequisite for its legitimacy. The stability criteria as the basis for the euro currency are constantly being violated. The euro has been "rescued" with billions for years. We are experiencing joint liability in violation of the treaty, transfer payments, debt at EU level, prohibited state financing and (planned) economic policy by the ECB and EU in violation of their mandates - all largely at the expense of Germany.
The euro is a misconstruction for an economic area with 20 very different economies and cannot function in this form either economically or socially. Unemployment in southern Europe has been alarmingly high for years. This is the result of the loss of competitiveness of these countries within the euro corset. Every supranational monetary union in history has failed so far. Only through national currencies will each country regain its sovereignty over its economic and monetary policy. This will also resolve the internal conflicts in the eurozone: the states can then restore their competitiveness by making their own decisions on the exchange rate, as they did before the introduction of the euro.
A new German mark could regain its higher purchasing power compared to other countries. The associated reduction in import prices would lead to rising real incomes and thus to a "social dividend" that would benefit the German people as a whole and not just a few export companies, as is currently the case. Similar to Switzerland, we would have considerably lower inflation without the ECB's excessive money printing policy.
1S	1D
¦ Cancel the transfer union
Germany must return to a social market economy - and therefore abandon the transfer union of the euro system. Any further participation in the permanent bailout policy is tantamount to insolvency at the expense of German taxpayers. The AfD is aware that the reintroduction of a stable national currency cannot take place without conversion costs. However, these will be lower than the permanent costs of remaining in the Eurosystem.
¦ Ending the anti-treaty and planned economy policy of the ECB and EU Commission
The ECB's policy is destroying the markets for government and corporate bonds. Manipulating the bond markets has been the ECB's daily "business model" since 2015. It has now purchased government and private bonds worth five trillion euros. This supranational "rescue policy" violates applicable EU law, including the ban on state financing by the central bank and the ban on liability for the debts of other member states. The ECB is also pursuing an ideological and forbidden economic policy - via multi-billion euro earmarked guarantees and sureties as well as purchases of "green" or otherwise ideologically issued bonds. These are, in effect, direct gifts of money to "distressed" states via a joint EU debt issue ("NextGenerationEU" fund, "Ukraine" bonds, etc. or TARGET2). All of these measures are in breach of the treaty, as they violate the prohibitions on monetary state financing and mutual assumption of liability.
The ECB's policy of low interest rates and government bond purchases must lead to inflation. It destroys company calculations and, in the long term, all funded pension systems and private savings. The ECB's interest rate policy is detached from any realistic consideration of risk and leads to uncompetitive companies remaining on the market as "zombies" and providing unfair competition for healthy companies.
Here too, the AfD demands a return to the law and the market economy: all measures by the ECB to manipulate the free capital market must be stopped. The AfD demands the enforcement of the contractual prohibition of state financing by the ECB and the de facto communitization of debt via the ECB. The ECB only has a mandate for monetary policy, not for economic policy programs to support individual states and ideological political goals.
¦ No borrowing by the EU - rescue loans only at national level and only for national investments
Today, the EU presumes to take on its own debt, contrary to the explicit wording of the EU treaties, at the expense of future German generations. The funds are procured through new debt and are then used by EU bureaucrats via countless, mostly ideologically motivated
"Green Deal" projects are issued in a landlord-like manner. However, liability and repayment remain with the national states. Germany's joint liability for these loans taken out by the EU, which largely benefit the euro crisis countries, inevitably leads to a deterioration in Germany's credit rating. The EU's controversial "ESG" and "taxonomy" requirements, which ideologically and to a large extent bureaucratically regulate which economic activities are "green" and therefore worthy of support, ultimately represent planned economy macro-control.
The AfD demands a return to the concept of an open market economy and the immediate cessation of any EU borrowing: no communitization of debt in violation of the treaty, no ideological
and centralized monetary or economic policy, return to capital allocation via functioning markets! Debt and tax collection should generally only take place at national level in line with the principle of subsidiarity! We want to free up money for national economic and social programs with a clear focus on long-term, sustainable infrastructure investments.
However, as long as the euro continues to exist at Germany's expense, Germany should also settle a large part of its new debt via the ECB and the EU. The funds should be used strictly for aid and investments in Germany.
¦ Preservation of the cash
Cash is freedom and protection against expropriation and total surveillance.
Our cash is in danger. With the support of the German government, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, it is being gradually abolished. The abolition of cash would restrict the role of money as an inviolable and fee-free store of value. The abolition of cash makes it possible to expropriate account holders in the event of a crisis. Cash is a natural bulwark against a further reduction in interest rates into negative territory. A cash ban would mean that payment transactions could only take place electronically. This would give the state and banks total control over all cash flows and economic activities, over every financial activity of citizens, even over their whereabouts. The transparent bank customer would become the transparent person - full surveillance and control right into private, even intimate areas of life (Chinese "social credit" system) would be pre-programmed. Such surveillance and control options are not compatible with a liberal constitutional state. Furthermore, electronic systems are not fail-safe or tamper-proof.
The AfD demands the permanent preservation of the unrestricted use of cash as an important civil right and its enshrinement in the Basic Law. The AfD is opposed to a digital euro issued centrally by the ECB, which would be a gateway for the creeping abolition of cash. The availability and store of value function of cash must be preserved. The AfD is opposed to the total monitoring and control of all financial activities through regulatory or de facto mandatory electronic payment transactions.
¦ No German liability for foreign banks
Banks are vital for the functioning of national economies. The European Banking Union would also subject the German savings banks, cooperative banks and the German private banking sector, which are currently anchored at local level, to EU redistribution. At several trillion euros, the planned European deposit guarantee scheme would be the largest joint liability facility in the EU. This communitization would make German savers and bank customers liable with their deposits for ailing banks in other countries, such as the Mediterranean countries, which already have large irrecoverable loan claims on their balance sheets. Huge defaults would only be a matter of time and would directly trigger a German payment obligation! This would be a further step towards the deepened liability and transfer union rejected by the AfD.
We demand that German banks limit liability to the national level and continue to be able to create their own liability and deposit guarantee association solutions. We advocate restoring national sovereignty over banking and financial services. The AfD opposes the European communitization of liability risks.
2
¦ End TARGET2 risk
The German Bundesbank's TARGET2 claims (overdraft facilities in the ECB's settlement system) against the ECB and indirectly against individual southern eurozone countries amount to over one trillion euros. According to the applicable ECB rules, these Bundesbank claims are unsecured, do not bear interest at a risk-adequate rate and cannot be called in. There are a number of probable scenarios for the derecognition of these amounts. TARGET2 value losses represent a high risk worth billions for the federal budget and therefore for the German taxpayer. It is certain that in the event of a (partial) dissolution of the eurozone, the ECB, as the Bundesbank's counterparty, will only settle the German TARGET claims in devalued euros or not at all. The irrecoverable receivables balances must be made usable if they cannot be melted down. One option would be to invest the assets already generated in the form of TARGET2 - using past work performed by Germans - in tangible assets, for example via a German sovereign wealth fund.
The AfD demands that the Federal Government and the German Bundesbank put an end to the overuse of the TARGET2 clearing account that has been tolerated to date. These claims of the Bundesbank must be reduced, balanced daily, subject to appropriate interest and backed by collateral. The AfD is also open to further sensible proposals to "monetize" the TARGET claims or make them usable. For example, Germany should invest its TARGET claims in foreign shares or gold or in a national real asset fund.
¦ Protection against the euro crisis, reforming the monetary system, bringing state gold back to Germany
Germany must also be able to act in the event of a sudden monetary crisis. In the event of a reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark, the state gold partially stored abroad could serve as a temporary cover option. According to all historical experience, gold is a potential cover for a currency, which is particularly relevant in crisis situations or after the introduction of a new currency to build confidence. Sovereign gold must be held as a potential last currency reserve without counterparty or custody risk in the country itself.
The AfD is calling on the German Bundesbank to transfer all of the state gold stored abroad to Germany. In addition, the AfD is calling for the gold reserve to be given a special constitutional status on the balance sheet to avert the risk of it being written off. In the long term, we consider a fundamental reform of the monetary system to be necessary, towards free currency competition or a gold-backed currency.
Preserve the economic and social sovereignty of EU member states
The AfD is striving for a new European economic community of sovereign nation states whose cooperation is geared towards increasing prosperity within a common market. However, the EU is currently pursuing not only an economic but also an ideologically motivated agenda with its economic policy decisions, which includes goals such as climate rescue, euro rescue, Russia sanctions and the inclusion of the Western Balkan states.
As the EU Member States are heterogeneous in terms of their economic strength and their historically evolved socio-economic value systems, majority decisions often violate legitimate economic interests.
individual interests of the member states. Moreover, such decisions often lead to the redistribution of wealth between states. One example of intergovernmental redistribution is the 750 billion euro "NextGenerationEU" fund, from which 390 billion euros are to be granted as non-repayable subsidies to EU member states. This alleged post-pandemic recovery facility has also been pre-financed by the EU Commission through borrowing in violation of EU law. Art. 311 TFEU expressly prohibits the Commission from incurring debt. As always, German taxpayers bear the main burden of this redistribution, which is carried out via the EU contributions of the Member States, which are graduated according to economic strength.
¦ Competition instead of bureaucracy
The AfD sees the purpose of a European association of sovereign nation states primarily in shaping the framework of a common European economy and ensuring fair competitive conditions. Competition is a basic prerequisite for technical progress, favorable consumer prices and the sustainability of our social systems. Economic risks must always be borne by the investor, not the state and therefore ultimately the taxpayer. We reject centralist interventions that are tantamount to expropriation.
The AfD is expressly committed to free trade. We strive for interest-based trade agreements that provide for import facilitation and customs exemptions for the contracting parties. Such trade agreements based on partnership help to promote economic development, for example in African countries. Germany owes its economic success to the creativity of its inventors and engineers as well as the courageous entrepreneurs who have invested in know-how and production facilities.
As a result of the EU's increasingly wide-ranging powers, parallel legislative procedures at national and European level are occurring more and more frequently with the effect of superseding national law. As a result, companies have to change their internal procedures after just a few years, as national regulations are replaced by European regulations. The AfD calls for a review and reduction of the relevant EU directives,
e.g. the EU Public Procurement Directive, the EU Services Directive, the Lending Directive, the Ecodesign Directive and the documentation requirements, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Supply Chain Act, which came into force at the beginning of 2023 and which the AfD has fought against from the outset with reference to the primary responsibility of EU states in enforcing social standards, also represents a distortion of competition. This regulation puts EU companies at a disadvantage in international competition because only they are burdened with additional social and environmental standards.
¦ Maintain added value, promote key technologies
An important prerequisite for innovation is openness to technology. The AfD therefore opposes the EU ban on combustion engines with all the political means at its disposal. This puts European automotive companies and suppliers at a considerable competitive disadvantage at international level. We take a fundamentally critical view of subsidies.
¦ Ensure quality standards
National and regional quality standards and indications of origin must be protected, including quality seals such as "Made in Germany". German training standards must not be lowered. The equivalence of professional qualifications acquired abroad must be proven by passing an examination at the place of work in accordance with the national standards applicable there.
¦ Investment management by the market instead of EU taxonomies
There are currently efforts in the EU to strengthen centrally controlled investment management for ideological reasons as part of the so-called taxonomy, for example in the case of so-called "green technologies". We reject the EU's Green Deal.
In the case of investment decisions in private companies, the companies themselves are liable for the consequences of poor decisions. In the case of public investments, however, it is not the responsible political decision-makers who are liable, but the taxpayers.
Entrepreneurial diligence is a better guide than political ideology. Planned market interventions with subsidies in line with a "socio-ecological transformation" and the banning of successful industries pose a huge threat to prosperity, freedom and the security of supply in the Member States.
¦ Immigration of workers
Within the common economic area, labor mobility can be valuable. However, the immigration of workers must always be geared towards the respective national or even regional labor market. Otherwise, there is a risk of wage dumping and the associated displacement of local workers.
Foreign EU workers must be paid in the same way in the member states in which they find employment and must be subject to the same legal regulations as domestic workers. Last but not least, this also promotes a more skills-based immigration of workers.
The current legal regulations, such as the Posted Workers Act, are largely sufficient. However, the AfD demands effective controls to ensure that they are complied with so that the abuse of temporary work and contracts for work and services is actually prevented.
¦ Freedom of establishment
We welcome the freedom of self-employed persons and entrepreneurs within the EU in principle. However, it must not be misused to obtain entitlements to social benefits through bogus self-employment.
The EU's freedom to provide services leads to the circumvention of minimum wages, taxes and social security contributions, particularly in the transport industry. This damages the welfare state. We therefore want to put an end to wage and social dumping.
¦ 
EU and Social policy
The AfD stands for a just and fair social policy, which must be guaranteed by a sustainable, intergenerationally fair design of the social security systems as well as reliable social security for pensioners, unemployed and employees in the lower wage or salary segment.
As the EU's competences under the treaties are limited to supporting and supplementing the measures of the Member States, the responsibility and competence for shaping social policy remain with the Member States. They are responsible for aligning their national social systems with their own values and shaping them according to their economic performance.
The Member States' ability to shape their own policies and the socio-economic differences that still exist between the Member States create incentives to migrate to countries with a higher level of social benefits. This leads to a conflict of objectives between the national interests of limiting the receipt of social benefits to one's own citizens and the goal of free movement within the EU. The AfD advocates that, in this conflict of objectives, the exercise of freedom of movement by EU citizens should be excluded if it primarily serves the purpose of receiving social benefits in Germany.
¦ Social benefits for EU- foreigners
Before EU foreigners are placed on an equal footing with Germans in social law, the respective country of origin should remain responsible in cases of need.
We are committed to ensuring that foreigners from EU countries only receive social benefits in Germany once they have paid taxes and social security contributions in Germany for ten years and have been able to support themselves without state assistance during this time.
¦ No European social union
The social security systems of the various EU countries are regulated very differently. The same applies to the labor markets. We want to preserve this diversity in the interests of competition between systems within the EU.
We are in favor of a coordinating social law including a social agreement, according to which social security entitlements acquired in other EU member states can be transferred to the social security system in the country of origin.
We regard any attempts by the EU to introduce minimum standards in the EU member states as violations
of the European Treaties. We consider the EU Social Charter to be superfluous.
The AfD rejects all attempts to undermine the Member States' competence to shape social policy, as laid down in the Treaties, by means of declarations (e.g. the "European Pillar of Social Rights") and thus to create new responsibilities for the EU institutions. Under no circumstances should there be a standardization of social systems, as this would entail the risk of domestic employees having to pay contributions for the insurance of employees in other EU states. Such a redistributive union contradicts the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon. This applies in particular to the already envisaged European unemployment insurance.

Taxes and finances
Fiscal sovereignty belongs to the national parliaments. Like other international organizations, the EU is to be financed exclusively by contributions from its member states.
¦ Taxation of internationally active large corporations
Major international corporations are very adept at minimizing their tax burden or avoiding tax payments altogether. We believe that it is no longer appropriate in the 21st century to tax large corporations according to where they are headquartered, for example. The actual economic activity that a group carries out in a country should be decisive for the tax burden. Instead of calling for a global minimum tax rate in order to eliminate tax havens, we believe it makes more sense to reach an international agreement that the tax burden imposed on a group at a national level should be calculated primarily on the basis of the proportion of the group's economic activity in the country levying the tax (so-called total group taxation). Countries such as the USA and Canada have been using this model since the 19th century for companies that operate in more than one state or province in order to create tax fairness. And unlike with global minimum taxation, each state could continue to use lower taxes to incentivize a company to expand its economic activity in a country. There would also be no need to differentiate between digital and non-digital business models.
¦ International Corporate taxation
Contrary to the EU's efforts, the permanent establishment principle must be retained for corporate income taxation. German companies, with their high proportion of exports, generally bear their risks at the location of their registered office. This is where the key business decisions are made, for example in the areas of research, production development, supply relationships, strategy, investments and much more. This is where the economic opportunities and risks are realized, which must also be taxed there in the case of company profits.
This applies with the exception of certain digital business models. Here, sales and advertising markets can be used as the starting point for corporate income taxation.
¦ No EU- taxes
The AfD rejects any kind of EU taxes. This applies both to taxes levied directly by the EU and to the EU's participation in taxes levied by the federal states. We reject the proportional transfer of proceeds from the minimum taxation of large corporations to the EU as additional own resources.
¦ Active promotion of own companies through tax relief
Countries such as Luxembourg secure competitive advantages by specifically promoting individual companies through tax breaks. We also consider it to be in Germany's national interest to support our own companies with lower taxes in special cases. However, existing regulations of world trade law must be complied with.
¦ 
Leave excise duty law with the Member States
We reject the harmonization of European consumption tax law. Past crises, which have always hit the lower and middle classes particularly hard, have clearly shown how important it is for states to have sufficient flexibility in tax structuring in order to be able to relieve the burden on citizens quickly and effectively through tax law. As consumption taxes in particular place a disproportionately heavy burden on low- and middle-income citizens, a reduction in these taxes can be an effective means of providing relief. It would therefore be counterproductive to restrict this freedom of the nation states by imposing strict EU limits.
¦ Financial transaction tax
We reject a financial transaction tax. We fear that this would place a greater burden on savers, as this tax would make unit-linked pension provision in particular more expensive. The very low proportion of small investors in the equity market in Germany would be further reduced by the introduction of the tax. Large investors and professional investors can move their transactions to stock exchanges outside the EU and thus easily avoid the tax. In addition, an EU-wide financial transaction tax would violate the fundamental tax sovereignty of the member states.
¦ Market economy instead of CO2 pricing
The AfD strictly rejects any form of CO2 pricing - be it via CO2 certificate trading or a direct CO2 tax - as well as the planned border adjustment mechanism.
Within the EU, CO2 pricing applies via CO2 certificate trading. In addition, imported goods will also be subject to a CO2 levy in the future via a CO2 border adjustment system. This will lead to a further increase in the price of all imported goods traded in the EU and thus inevitably to a further loss of prosperity for citizens. There is also a risk of a trade war, as this special tax on imported goods will be perceived as protectionism by other countries.
¦ Strengthen regions
The AfD is striving for a reform of EU public procurement law. Tenders at municipal or national level should be awarded primarily to regional or national providers. To this end, the threshold values for EU procurement should be raised and the regulations should be made more flexible so that the most favorable bidder from the entire EU does not always have to be awarded the contract.
¦ Reduce the EU budget
The AfD rejects an expansion of the EU budget and instead calls for a significant reduction in EU spending. The fines collected by the EU should be passed on proportionately to the Member States.
Numerous EU programs worth billions are used to distribute EU funds widely and effectively to the public without providing measurable impetus for the prosperity of local population groups, such as the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) or the Cohesion Fund. This money is better spent by the EU member states, which are primarily responsible for their own infrastructure.
raised. After all, the "cohesion" of the economies of all member states has always been and will continue to be a fiction. To reduce the expenditure of the EU administration, the costly and time-consuming commuting between the three places of work - Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg - must be ended.
¦ Reform of EU own resources
The GNI-based own resources based on gross national income represent the largest share of EU revenue, currently around 70 percent. Although Germany has a high gross national income, wealth in Germany is unevenly distributed relative to other countries. In addition, Germans are in the bottom third of wealth comparisons with other EU member states and bring up the rear in terms of home ownership rates. Pension benefits in Germany currently amount to 53% of final net income, which is well behind countries such as Greece with 84%, Italy with 82% and France with 74%. The claim that Germany is a rich country is false.
Due to the unequal distribution of wealth, there is considerable wealth among a small top group, which is why average wealth is in the middle internationally. However, the median wealth of Germans paints a different picture. Here, Germany is in second-last place in a comparison of OECD countries. This is also due to the fact that the home ownership rate in Germany is so low. In future, the basis of measurement for the member states should therefore no longer be gross national income (GNI), but national income. While GNI is a figure that is linked to gross economic revenues, national income represents the annual economic output of an economy that accrues to citizens and companies. In investment-intensive economies such as Germany, the difference between GNI and national income is very high. The GNI is therefore unsuitable and unfair as a yardstick for the EU contribution and leads to an excessive burden on Germany.
Foreign policy
¦ Germany and Europe in the changing international relations	
We believe that the prerequisite for German foreign policy is a sovereign Germany that guarantees freedom, justice, prosperity and security for its citizens. We stand for a Europe of nations and firmly reject the centralist efforts of the EU. The federation of European nations, which we aspire to as an economic and community of interests, preserves extensive sovereignty internally and enables coordination in external relations. The guiding principle of German foreign policy must once again be realpolitik requirements instead of unrealistic ideologies.
A stable peace order in Europe requires balanced cooperation between all European states, whose legitimate security interests must be taken into account. The role of the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE) in stabilizing crisis regions in Europe and its periphery must be further developed. We advocate respect for international law and, in particular, for the right of peoples to self- determination. At the same time, we call for compliance with the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of states by other powers and non-state actors. This also applies to EU interference in the affairs of member states. We reject further demands for reparations, such as those put forward by Poland and Greece, because these issues have already been conclusively clarified under international law. The legal and peaceful order that has developed in Europe must not be called into question by unacceptable demands.
¦ 
Pooling common European interests
The AfD is in favor of bundling pan-European interests in foreign policy without restricting the sovereignty of the national states, their democratic decision-making and the design of their legal systems. We reject a legally formalized common foreign and security policy of the EU (CFSP) as well as a common European External Action Service. Instead, we advocate intensifying intergovernmental coordination among the European partner countries and, where possible, acting jointly.
We are in favor of a flexible network in which each European state can participate according to its own interests and possibilities.
¦ USA
Good relations with the USA are essential for Germany and Europe. We want a partnership with the USA "on an equal footing". This includes, in particular, the further development of economic, technological and scientific exchange. However, the geopolitical and economic interests of the USA increasingly differ from those of Germany and other European countries. One example of this is the energy supply, such as the massive attempt by the USA to prevent the Nord Stream gas pipeline from going into operation.
The Nord Stream project is of paramount importance for Europe's energy supply and cannot be replaced without far-reaching economic problems. Germany must not allow itself to be drawn into conflicts with other powers as a result of soft decisions made by the USA. The foreign and security policy of the USA forces Germany to formulate its interests independently. This should be done in the closest possible coordination with other European states.
¦ Russia
The Russian invasion caused a great deal of suffering among those affected in Ukraine. The war has made Germany's foreign policy extremely difficult. Russia's geostrategic position and the resulting historical and economic ties, especially with Germany, make it necessary to use diplomatic means to work towards an end to the war and thus ensure peaceful German-Russian relations. For decades, Russia has been a reliable supplier and guarantor of an affordable energy supply, which is the Achilles heel of the German economy due to our energy-intensive industry. Restoring undisturbed trade with Russia requires the immediate lifting of economic sanctions against Russia and the repair of the Nord Stream pipelines. Germany's relations with the Eurasian Economic Union should be expanded.
¦ China
The relationship with China must be geared towards Germany's realpolitik interests. China is one of Germany's most important trading partners. Patent protection, the intensification of participation in Chinese companies, the protection of company secrets and bilateral free trade must become the focus of German-Chinese relations.
With the "New Silk Road" project, China has embarked on a project of the century. In order to be able to help shape it on an equal basis, the AfD advocates Germany's proactive participation. Germany should complement the Silk Road strategy from East to West with an initiative from West to East. This applies in particular to supra-regional infrastructure projects.
Germany should strive for observer status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in order to take the importance of this market adequately into account.
¦ European Neighborhood
North Africa and the Middle East are geostrategically important regions of the world for Europe. The AfD is committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts. Peace, stability and prosperity are the prerequisites for an end to mass migration.
Turkey is an important strategic and economic partner for us. However, we reject interference in our internal affairs by means of ideological or financial support for Islamist groups in Europe. Culturally, Turkey does not belong to Europe. The AfD demands the immediate termination of EU accession negotiations with Turkey and the cessation of financial pre-accession aid.
Defense and security policy
¦ Strategic autonomy: Europe's security autonomy in the new age
The world is undergoing a transition to a multipolar order, which presents Europe with security policy challenges.
The future of European security lies in pooling the military capabilities of states in a separate system of collective security. The European nation states should be guided by the will to pool their armed forces in a defense community.
Germany and its European neighbors must no longer rely exclusively on the protection or assurances of non-European countries, but must finally achieve far-reaching military and strategic autonomy.
Currently, NATO is the essential cornerstone of our security and defense capability, insofar as NATO limits itself to its task as a defense alliance. Operations outside the Alliance area in which German armed forces participate should always take place under a UN mandate and only if German security interests are taken into account.
We welcome meaningful cooperation at European level in the qualification, procurement and development of military capabilities.
The AfD rejects a European army and maintains a fully capable Bundeswehr as the cornerstone of German sovereignty. With a strong armed force of its own, Germany can be put in a position to replace the American armed forces on German soil in the medium term.
German contribution to European security
As things stand at present, the Bundeswehr is not in a position to defend Germany's territory, neither in terms of numbers nor equipment. Germany's defense capability must be restored without delay. The focus should be on the ability to defend the country and secure trade routes.
We see the greatest challenge here in increasing personnel to the necessary size and procuring and introducing new weapons systems on the appropriate scale. Securing the personnel basis and adequate structures of the Bundeswehr will only be possible if we reverse the suspension of compulsory military service. The defense budget must be adapted to the requirements of Germany's security policy strategy.
Preservation and expansion of the German and European defense industry
The AfD demands the preservation and expansion of defense technology capabilities, the safeguarding of existing jobs in this high-tech sector and planning security for German industry and our armed forces. To this end, new defense technology programs must be initiated. In the context of future armaments cooperation, we insist on the protection of German interests. Our key technologies must not be sold to third countries. In addition, attention must be paid to a balanced relationship between financing and proportional production in Germany. Germany must strive for system leadership in key capabilities. New procurements of military equipment should primarily come from German and European production.
¦ Foreign trade policy
The AfD is striving for a new version of European cooperation. Against this background, there should also be a closely coordinated European foreign trade policy in the future. We are in favour of a reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and increased cooperation, for example with the BRICS countries or regional organizations such as ASEAN and Mercosur.
All agreements must be negotiated in transparent procedures and ratified by national parliaments. The AfD rejects the transfer of national sovereignty rights to private arbitration tribunals outside of bilateral investment protection agreements. The interests of small and medium-sized enterprises must be given much greater consideration in foreign trade policy. We reject bureaucratic obstacles such as the Supply Chain Act. Nevertheless, standards in consumer and environmental protection as well as in the social sector must be maintained. In principle, we support the relocation of manufacturing for Europe back to the European region. In this way, we would like to increase industry's share of value creation in Germany again and develop regional, sustainable and less disruptive economic cycles.
Foreign policy must not be geared towards attrition in an economic war, but must once again be committed to the goals of economic growth, prosperity and the protection of domestic industry. We want to lift the existing sanctions against Russia and Syria and reject any sanctions against China. Appropriate measures must be taken against unjustified trade restrictions by third countries and the protection of intellectual property and equal treatment of companies must be ensured.
Foreign trade, security and development policy must be coordinated. The freedom of sea and trade routes and thus access to raw materials, energy and sales markets must be ensured.
3
¦ Development policy
The AfD is calling for development policy to be shifted back to the national level. Both sides should benefit from joint projects. Development aid should be help for self-help. Projects must be subject to strict monitoring of their use and regular evaluation of the results. The granting of development aid should be linked, among other things, to the willingness to take back migrants who are obliged to leave the country. Private sector initiatives, competitive jobs and security of supply should be promoted. The Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) should be strengthened in the area of international development financing. The German government must develop a coherent cross-departmental Africa strategy for the African continent. Nuclear powers and states that grant development aid themselves should no longer receive development aid. We reject a European development policy alongside the development policy of nation states, if only because of the fragmentation this would cause.
¦ Foreign cultural policy
The task of Germany's foreign cultural policy must be to build bridges to other peoples, to deepen knowledge of German culture and history and to support the domestic economy and tourism by establishing and maintaining international contacts. The institutions currently entrusted with these tasks (foreign broadcasters, Goethe-Institut, various individual regional projects) have not lived up to this claim for years. German is the most widely spoken language in the EU. For this reason, German must be given de facto equal status with English and French in the European institutions.
The AfD is expressly committed to Germany's duty of care towards German minorities abroad and will strongly support their interests. This includes, in particular, the promotion of language teaching in German minority areas, the promotion of German schools, kindergartens, newspapers and libraries as well as the exchange of cultural workers across borders. We are critical of the Polish Ministry of Education's decree, which came into force on September 1, 2022, to reduce German lessons for the German minority from three to one hour per week.
The AfD is committed to ensuring compliance with the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.
Traffic
The AfD advocates a transport policy based on the needs of citizens. The AfD rejects an ideologically driven policy that favors, disadvantages or even prohibits certain means of transport. For us, the freedom of citizens to choose their means of transportation is paramount. I n d i v i d u a l mobility must remain affordable. States can work together on the realization of infrastructure projects on a consensual basis. However, we fundamentally reject granting the EU further powers to standardize transport and infrastructure policy. The AfD is against age-limiting measures for driving licenses and, in particular, against EU plans for driving-license-limiting measures such as driving fitness checks for everyone over the age of 70.
¦ Protecting motorized private transport
The AfD supports and promotes motorized private transport as the most popular and modern way of getting around. Intelligent technology and congestion-avoiding traffic management protect the environment. Scientifically unfounded measures, such as bans on diesel vehicles or the introduction of
lanes, do not achieve this. At the same time, the AfD demands the preservation and expansion of inner-city lanes and parking spaces to avoid increasing traffic chaos and to protect the attractiveness of the retail trade. The AfD strictly rejects a general speed limit on federal highways. It would like to enable young people from the age of 16 to drive under supervision in order to participate in road traffic responsibly and at an early age.
¦ Strengthening European transport links
The growing importance of the East-West connections in Germany for the European transport network must also be recognized by the European Union and promoted accordingly. In particular, the gaps in the highway network that have existed for many years must be closed as quickly as possible. Many highways and bridges in Germany have long been in urgent need of renovation and repair. This is only possible with efficient measures in the planning and execution of construction sites as well as fast work by the administration. In addition, the AfD demands a sufficient number of truck parking spaces and the consistent application of existing truck overtaking bans to protect all road users.
¦ Relieve congestion on federal highways - shift transit traffic to rail and waterways
The truck toll, which we want to shape nationally and whose regulation by the EU we reject, should contribute to directing transit freight traffic to rail and waterways. The concept of the "rolling highway" and swap body handling should be established for transit connections through Germany with regular intervals. The network of loading points and multimodal freight transport scenarios (road, rail and waterways) must therefore be densified. Deutsche Bahn must be upgraded so that it can cope with this task. In order to relieve road and rail traffic across borders, we call for the more efficient use of natural water resources and the comprehensive renovation of dilapidated locks and weirs.
¦ Making European rail transport fit for the future
The AfD would like to expand the Rhine route from Basel to Rotterdam in a sustainable manner, also in order to be able to fulfill existing contracts with our Swiss neighbors. In rail transport, the blockade caused by country-specific signaling systems must be overcome. The fundamentally good idea of introducing a uniform European Train Control System (ETCS) has developed into a billion-dollar grave under the influence of national isolationist interests. The AfD is committed to reducing this system to the lowest common denominator in order to ensure Europe-wide compatibility and reduce costs. The first step in expanding the European rail network is to stabilize the precarious power supply in Germany, which has already led to numerous train cancellations.
¦ Road haulage without wage and social dumping
Since almost half of the trucks in long-distance transport today come from Eastern Europe at dumping prices and the freight transport of foreign companies in a neighboring country (cabotage) is increasing considerably, there is a need for action. We are planning increased controls and higher penalties for driving time and driver leasing in pan-European road haulage as effective instruments. The AfD will work to ensure that German companies become more competitive again.
32	33
¦ Strengthening air traffic as an economic factor
The AfD is in favor of abolishing the aviation tax and opposes unrealistic EU CO2 reduction targets. Global air traffic is of fundamental importance for Germany and Europe - and must not be sacrificed to unscientific climate hysteria. The AfD rejects any ban on short-haul flights.
¦ Maintaining the automotive industry as a leading industry
The AfD is aware of the strategic importance of the German automotive and supplier industry. The small and medium-sized enterprises responsible for the majority of jobs, particularly in the metalworking industry, are dependent on the continued existence of the combustion engine. It is not the task of the EU to determine how and whether drive technologies for motor vehicles are developed. The AfD is generally in favor of preserving the combustion engine. The EU's one-sided preference for electromobility must be stopped immediately, as it cannot be used across the board due to a lack of electricity capacity and infrastructure. Battery production also has a far greater impact on the environment than the combustion engine.
Whether the combustion engine will one day be replaced by other forms of propulsion or continue to exist must remain purely a question of technical progress and the market. Vehicles with combustion engines powered by synthetic fuel must be treated equally to electrically powered vehicles in terms of their tax burden. This applies both to the energy source itself and to the vehicle as a whole. The AfD is opposed to the planned tightening of European emissions standards and rejects Euro 7 in particular.
Building and living
For centuries, Europe has been characterized by a diversity of national architectural styles. The way of building and living in Europe has grown historically and is characterized by national and landscape characteristics. The urban and rural housing culture that has evolved is a treasure that must be preserved.
Building law and the associated regulations are exclusively a national responsibility. Any intervention in the construction planning sovereignty of the individual EU Member States must be rejected. The AfD defends the diversity of European building culture and opposes the standardization and tightening of building directives by the EU, which lead to an enormous increase in costs and thus also rents in housing construction.
¦ No EU competence for construction and housing
Although the EU has no independent legislative competence for the areas of construction and housing, it is also attempting to exert political influence in this field. This is done via EU energy policy. However, there can be no EU regulation that is suitable for all buildings from Finland to Portugal!
The AfD is fighting against the EU's efforts to only allow the construction of so-called climate-neutral residential buildings from 2030. We also reject the unrealistic goal of making the entire building stock in the EU emission-free in the medium term. The EU only wants to allow exceptions for historic buildings, churches and defense facilities.
This EU agenda disregards the desire of citizens for affordable housing that meets their needs. The AfD rejects an EU-wide solar obligation on the roofs of new and renovated residential buildings and industrial facilities. With the AfD, there is no EU refurbishment obligation for allegedly inefficient buildings.
¦ Funding, promotion and migration
The European Mortgage Credit Directive often prevents the necessary credit financing for young families, the self-employed and older citizens. The AfD is therefore calling for the European Residential Property Credit Directive to be repealed without replacement.
All EU funding for housing construction must be transferred back to the national and regional level so that it can be used there in a targeted and efficient manner.
The EU's migration policy is a major contributor to the fact that the housing market in Germany is also overloaded, rents are rising and locals are being displaced. This policy must be ended immediately.
¦ Infrastructure
As with the strategic oil reserve, appropriate storage facilities for gas must be kept available for German companies and consumers. If intact, the Nord Stream pipeline must be released for gas supply immediately. The repair of lines damaged by a terrorist attack must be arranged immediately.
¦ Ideology-free spatial planning and use
Existing regional development plans in Germany and other EU countries are currently being amended in the direction of supposedly "climate-proof spatial planning and use". T h e primary aim here is to build more wind farms and large-scale photovoltaic systems throughout Europe. Landscape and nature conservation are being subordinated or even sacrificed for the sake of supposed climate protection. This creates countless new problems at the expense of the environment. We therefore demand: No blanket privileges for buildings to generate so-called "renewable energies" in outdoor areas!
Instead, we strive to preserve and strengthen the unique character of European regions. This relates to the structure of agriculture and local settlements.
¦ Equal rights for urban and rural areas
Living conditions in rural areas must not lag behind those in cities and metropolitan areas. We expressly support the strengthening of transport and digital infrastructure. Appropriate promotion of the economy in rural areas is a further building block on the way to equal living conditions. The goal is the "vital rural area".
Agriculture and forestry, nature conservation, animal welfare, hunting, environmental and consumer protection
Our evolved cultural landscape and the environment are increasingly endangered by an ever-expanding and relentless EU centralism. Under the guise of so-called climate protection policy, lobby interests are opposing a sensible environmental and agricultural policy that is geared towards regional needs. By implementing the "Green Deal", a multi-billion euro redistribution machine is being set in motion, leading to deindustrialization and the destruction of nature. This harms citizens, the environment and the economy. At the same time, the right to self-determination of the member states - one of the key founding principles of the EU - is being further undermined.
The EU has failed to combine agriculture and environmental protection in a meaningful way. Ideologically driven misguided incentives and vested interests prevent the sustainable promotion of forestry and agriculture as well as the preservation and protection of our natural environment. Sprawling bureaucracy is destroying the existence of the regionally rooted farming community and rural areas that have worked for society for generations.
The AfD is fighting for a Germany in which food security and self-sufficiency are guaranteed for future generations. At the same time, our agriculture should ensure that consumers are supplied with high-quality and affordable food in harmony with nature and animal welfare. Therefore, instead of centralized EU bureaucracy, we demand an environmental, forestry and agricultural policy that is geared towards regional needs.
¦ Promotion of agriculture and rural areas
The various branches of agriculture - arable farming, livestock farming, viticulture, forestry and horticulture - create jobs and are important service providers for our population as regionally connected primary suppliers. We need to pay more attention to this elementary branch of the economy again. Young people should develop an understanding of nature and agriculture. Regional products such as vegetables, fruit, meat and fish must be given priority over imported goods. The structural framework conditions of agriculture must be designed in such a way that small and medium-sized farms can also operate successfully in the long term. This is the only way to guarantee regional value chains, short transportation routes and the supply of high-quality food, even in times of crisis.
The AfD is committed to strengthening the independence of farmers and bringing market economy principles back to the fore. Proper and performance-based remuneration for farmers, livestock farmers and food producers must be ensured for generations to come. This can only happen with more independence and without EU regulation mania - as with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which we reject.
It is necessary to structure marketing and trade in such a way that smaller farms are not at a disadvantage compared to the wholesale chains. This must be made possible by creating fair relationships between producers, retailers and consumers and by strengthening direct marketing.
The AfD stands for the preservation - and, wherever possible, the expansion - of agriculturally usable land. We reject the reallocation of high-quality agricultural land in favor of so-called renewable energies. Here, too, we demand: Less EU, but more regional and national decision-making power!
Effective plant protection must be based on professional training, good professional practice and the latest scientific findings. We are aware that many of these scientific findings are manipulated by green anti- farmer and anti-technology propaganda. We have recognized green lobbying in this field as a threat to our farmers and will actively counteract it. Here too, the national-regional scope for action should be given preference over a centrally bureaucratic EU administration. The use of genetic engineering should be strictly monitored and always checked for its actual benefits.
Increased use by ground-mounted photovoltaic systems is contrary to the goal of land conservation. In particular, the consumption of biotopes and agricultural land by so-called agrivoltaics must be prevented. Euphemistically referred to as "energy harvesting", the use of landscape and arable land is in contradiction to self-sufficiency and degrades local agriculture to an accomplice in an already failed energy transition experiment. In addition, the consequences for crop cultivation have not been sufficiently researched to be able to reliably estimate possible crop losses.
¦ Forest management and forestry
Europe's extensive forest areas must be protected in terms of ecology, economy and recreation. However, this can only be done in strict compliance with the principle of subsidiarity. This is because the different climatic and geographical conditions require adapted regional forest management without overbearing control by Brussels.
Planning games far removed from national particularities are therefore out of place. Forest management belongs in the regional hands of forestry experts and owners. The benefits of forests as water reservoirs, suppliers of natural building materials and wood as an energy source are undisputed. Sustainable management over generations must be the unalterable goal!
We reject the further set-aside of forestry areas in the sense of a misunderstood idea of protection. Due to its dense population, Germany needs a rational balancing of interests when it comes to forest use. Professional management is indispensable for the preservation of the forest, also with regard to climatic influences. In this context, the AfD stands for sustainable forest conversion.
We demand the reduction of excessive bureaucracy and excessive documentation requirements. The lobbying of self-appointed environmental associations in favor of the wind power industry, which has been going on for years under the auspices of the EU, must be ended as quickly as possible. We reject the clearing of forests, a cultural asset, for wind turbines. Such wind turbines cannot solve our energy problem.
¦ Animal welfare and protection
We are committed to animal husbandry in Germany. The AfD stands for the consistent implementation of animal protection laws in line with our responsibility for animals as sentient fellow creatures! We want to promote species-appropriate husbandry systems in livestock farming.
Regional livestock farming close to home reduces the need to transport animals. We are committed to limiting the transportation of live animals to no more than six hours. For the purposes of
3C	37
breeding, the transportation of live animals must be possible under defined conditions and under strict veterinary control by certified companies.
The robust and healthy livestock that develop in species-appropriate husbandry contribute significantly to the prevention of multi-resistant germ development by reducing the necessary use of antibiotics.
Slaughter according to religious rituals is only permitted after sufficient stunning. The duration of stunning must be guaranteed for the entire slaughter process. The German standard for slaughterhouses should also be applied to imported goods.
¦ Hunting, conservation and species protection
Hunting is nature conservation in action. The AfD supports hunting in harmony with nature. We stand for the proven principle of forest with game. We clearly reject the "forest before game" ideology prevalent in left-green circles, which degrades game species to pests. This is because it is contrary to animal welfare and game biology - and therefore to hunting in accordance with hunting principles!
The further impairment of hunting by EU regulations in hunting, weapons and food law must be prevented. Existing regulations must be reviewed and brought into line with the interests of farmers, forest and land owners and hunters. The good training of hunting license holders in Germany must not be watered down by EU regulations.
Active management should enable problematic wild animal populations to be monitored and corrected at regional level in a timely manner. As the example of the wolf shows, a sense of reality must take precedence over uncontrolled settlement. The wolf population must be understood as a uniform European population. It should be regulated spatially and numerically in line with the Swedish and Norwegian models. To this end, the wolf should be transferred from Annex IV to Annex V of the Habitats Directive.
Invasive species and their wildlife populations threaten our native biodiversity, game populations and agriculture and livestock farming. Regulation and suppression of these species must be possible without bureaucracy in order to stabilize nature and prevent a threat to native flora and fauna.
¦ Wind power industry versus species and landscape protection
Wind turbines pose a fundamental threat to plants and animals as well as an impairment of people's health and quality of life. In particular, the death of birds, bats and insects is accepted as collateral damage of the left-green energy transformation. The consequences of this are population declines that can lead to the extinction of protected species. No other form of energy takes such a heavy toll on wildlife as the wind power industry! The effects of soil erosion and wind drag caused by wind turbines must be researched as quickly as possible. Further approvals must be suspended until these effects have been established. This type of energy generation also has a massive impact on the soil and water balance. Further damage to our natural environment in the name of supposed climate protection must be prevented at all costs.
¦ 
Water protection
The European Water Framework Directive sets central limit values for the EU that are binding for the member states. Such a centralized regulatory framework causes different adjustment difficulties and excessive bureaucracy in the individual regions, which prevent measures from being taken when evidence- based limit values are exceeded. Water protection therefore belongs primarily in the hands of the nation states and, in Germany, the federal states. In coordinated cooperation with representatives of local authorities, agriculture and other stakeholders, they can ensure water protection much more effectively.
¦ Consumer protection
Consumers must be able to deal with increasingly global companies on an equal footing. However, consumers lack essential information about the origin and quality of many foodstuffs, financial products and material goods. The AfD wants to put consumers in a position to make informed purchasing decisions and calls for the asymmetrical information situation between consumers and companies to be balanced out. In doing so, we do not want to give consumers preferential treatment by the state or confuse them with too much information. Our goals are clearly recognizable, transparent information and informed consumers. However, this must not lead to impractical regulations.
Germany has a well-functioning food control system. There is no need for a superordinate EU authority here. We reject supranational intervention in procedures and advocate the transfer of competencies back to the nation states. Pan-European issues can be discussed at European level and then decided in a coordinated manner - not the other way around. The European harmonization of food safety must not result in a lowering of standards in Germany. We therefore reject centralized regulations.
We call for an efficient rapid alert system for feed and food safety. In the event of reasonable suspicion of harmful products, food toxins or animal diseases, we advocate controls at the European internal borders. We also call for the labeling of products with a clear declaration of content and weight in relation to the sales price in order to prevent consumer deception. For example, there must be no hidden addition of insects to foodstuffs; instead, this must be clearly labeled. In general, we advocate the reversal of the EU insect ban. The AfD is in favor of prominently displaying on packaging whether insects or insect parts are included. The AfD firmly rejects any weakening of existing standards through unilaterally negotiated free trade agreements!
Climate, energy and digitalization
CO2 is one of the foundations of our existence. Without CO2 in the air, there would be no plants. The climate has always changed since the earth's existence. There has never been a constant climate over long periods of time. Even since the last ice age around 10,000 years ago, the climate in Europe has alternated between phases that were colder or warmer than the current climate. The current climatic changes are fully in line with these changes - also in terms of their speed. Despite the alarmism spread by the media and politicians, in reality there has been neither an increase in extreme weather events nor a rapid rise in sea levels. Ever since humans have settled in Europe, they have always adapted to climate change. Even today, adaptation is the only possible way to deal with climate change.
Responsibility for adapting to climatic conditions lies with the individual nations of the EU. In the event of any changes, it is up to the countries to decide on measures in response to how they are affected. On the German side, the climatic changes of the recent past do not require any special measures. Expending resources and regulations in response to only possible future changes is unnecessary, economically and ecologically irresponsible.
A country's high level of prosperity, strong industry and economy allow it to react to both weather events and climatic changes at short notice if necessary - this is another reason why the AfD wants to put a stop to the destruction of prosperity in the countries of the Union.
An intact landscape and nature, for example, with high biodiversity, little sealed surfaces, sensible water management with natural rivers and floodplains, is also more resilient and flexible in relation to different weather conditions. This is why the AfD is committed to an appropriate environmental policy. This includes, in particular, the AfD's energy concept, which aims to conserve resources and use less land.
Fossil fuels were and are the basis of our prosperity. The claim of a threat from man-made climate change is not based on scientific findings. Rather, it is a political agenda to tax the air we breathe and thus implement social transformations (Great Transformation). It is an eco-socialist project that will inevitably lead to a dramatic reduction in prosperity and a totalitarian restriction of freedom. The already dwindling prosperity and our lack of future viability are a direct consequence of decarbonization, which is being pursued for purely political reasons. The EU, caught up in the ideology of the great transformation of society, is increasingly embarking on a special international path. The main global drivers of this fatal ideology are the Brussels bureaucrats with their Green Deal, who have no democratic legitimacy.
¦ No eco-socialist redistribution: "Fit for 55"
The "Fit for 55" package is a dystopia of an eco-socialist Brussels liability and redistribution state, cast in the form of regulations and directives by the EU Commission. The number 55 stands for the 55% reduction in CO2 emissions required by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In other words, emissions are to be reduced by 31% in the remaining years up to 2030 - 24% has already been achieved in the last 32 years. This alone shows the ignorance with regard to the data basis, feasibility and common sense. The "Fit for 55" package is the legal underpinning of the "Green Deal" and thus of a transformative change in our economy, society and industry. It is based on the European Climate Law adopted in 2021.
This general law, described by its initiators as "irreversible", demands the adaptation of all future and existing laws. The aim is for Brussels to rule directly into the personal lives of every citizen, bypassing all democratically elected and legitimized national parliaments. Many citizens are not aware that EU regulations are automatically valid without the approval of the German Bundestag. Using the media-fueled climate catastrophe predictions, "Fit for 55" not only wants to implement an energy transition, but also a consumption transition, a resource transition, a mobility transition, a food transition and an industrial transition. The planned ban on oil and gas heating is a serious encroachment on citizens' property and fundamental rights, which the AfD is fighting politically.
Through political reforms, the EU wants to implement comprehensive carbon pricing throughout the economy. This should then bring about changes in consumer and business behavior. Exploding energy prices are only the first signal of a "green world rescue". The deliberately induced energy shortage is intended to create a society that is helplessly at the mercy of the Brussels central state and dependent on monetary benefits.
citizens. At the same time, it cements an unprecedented redistribution of German taxpayers' wealth at EU level. Thanks to the continued proclamation of so-called crises, such as the climate, financial, migration, corona and gas crises, Brussels is able to demand financial packages of unprecedented size with "the distribution of the associated burdens among the Member States according to their relative prosperity".
These lead to the joint borrowing of the "NextGenerationEU" fund. In addition, the Commission wants to use the upcoming European emergency law to take direct control of the economic sector right down to individual companies. A "coordinated" concept for risk and crisis communication to the public is planned. A crisis would then be declared without parliamentary control. The path to a surveillance state with a planned economy is mapped out.
¦ CO2 tax, climate madness and limit values
The AfD does not allow people to be judged by their carbon footprint. We do not share the irrational CO2 hysteria that is structurally destroying our society, culture and way of life. We stand for freedom, progress and science!
We do not want EU limits that climate lobbyists can push through against Germany's most basic interests. We are clearly in favor of a rational discussion on limit values: measures must be objectively justified, sensible, affordable and feasible! The AfD also consistently opposes
"Greenwashing", whereby raw materials are mined in third countries under precarious conditions with considerable damage to the environment.
With the EU's decision to ban combustion engines by 2035, which is supported by all the old parties, it is pursuing the goal of abolishing private transport for the majority of the population. The AfD is on the side of citizens who are dependent on cars or who see the freedom of individual transport as an achievement of civilization. The Alternative for Germany therefore strictly rejects driving bans.
¦ Energy
Cheap and reliable energy is the key to prosperity and progress. Despite decades of subsidies, volatile energy sources are expensive and unsuitable for supplying the EU. They destroy natural and settlement areas. Storage facilities are not feasible. "Bio" gas and fuels take valuable land away from food production and make both goods more expensive. Due to this ideological energy policy, electricity, mobility, warm homes and food are becoming a luxury for citizens. Industrial companies and consumers alike are suffering from the world's highest energy prices. The result is emigration or impoverishment. As can be seen from the Ukraine conflict, there is a direct link between energy and foreign policy.
Cheap natural gas for households and businesses is of geostrategic interest to Germany and Europe. In future, one-sided dependencies must be avoided. The AfD is striving for a reorientation of the German energy supply without ideological blinkers. Neither unconventional shale gas extraction nor nuclear energy or lignite can be ruled out. Shale gas extraction has also been practiced in Germany for decades. Environmental pollution can be ruled out if current regulations are observed. Nuclear energy offers an environmentally friendly and affordable energy supply for the next millennia thanks to decades of proven high-safety technology. Coal-fired power generation is clean thanks to sophisticated air filters and is necessary for gypsum production, among other things.

Our demands are concrete:
? Abolish all climate protection laws at national and European level and stop the "Green Deal", "Fit for 55" and other CO2 reduction programs of the Brussels bureaucrats.
? Abolition of EU emissions trading and no "CO2 compensation" at the EU's external borders.
? Renationalization of energy policy.
? Every state must ensure its own supply of electricity.
? Cancellation of subsidies for volatile solar and wind energy.
? Diversification of energy suppliers (countries and technologies).
? Clarification of the Nord Stream attacks and repair of the damaged pipelines.
? Resume nuclear energy research. Germany and Europe must once again become the leading providers in the field of nuclear energy. In view of the politically induced reduction of German industrial capabilities
¦ 
For citizen-friendly data protection
The GDPR is not only an example of over-bureaucratization by the EU, but also stands for the systematic disregard of the principle of subsidiarity. Responsibility for data protection must also be returned to the nation states.
The General Data Protection Regulation in its current form must be replaced by a citizen-friendly national
regulation.
Health policy
in the field of nuclear technology, European and international research cooperation should be sought to	
this end.
? Resumption of electricity production in the six German nuclear power plants that have been decommissioned since the end of 2021
? Remove regulatory discrimination against nuclear energy (e.g. taxonomy).
? Maintain coal-fired power generation (including lignite), at least until sufficient nuclear reactors are connected to the grid.
¦ Digitization
The freedom of citizens on the Internet is being increasingly restricted from year to year by mostly politically or ideologically motivated interventions ranging from range restrictions to exclusion from services (deplatforming). This contradicts our understanding of freedom. Instead, the state must return to the purpose of the internet: to connect people and information. We reject the EU's digitalization regulations, as they always involve surveillance or censorship. They threaten the freedom of citizens and the competitiveness of EU countries. Over-bureaucratization costs billions and prevents start-ups and the development of new digital technologies. These include the GDPR, upload filters and ancillary copyright. EU member states are largely dependent on external hardware and software. Even with hardware, there are problems with regard to the security and freedom of citizens due to deliberate loopholes (backdoors) or undefined spyware in the background. A primary goal must therefore be to restore the security of the IT infrastructure and to become more independent of non-European markets, also with regard to data sovereignty. For a free society, it is essential that digital networks and services are trustworthy and that the privacy of users is protected.
Our demands are concrete:
? The civil liberties of citizens must not be restricted by digitalization.
? The EU must demand that platform providers disclose and stop all censorship activities.
? Ensure citizens' freedom of speech and data (right to encryption and net neutrality).
? The regulation of digitalization must be in national hands and data economy must prevail at EU level.
We reject an "EU data octopus".
The GDPR, the ancillary copyright regulation and upload filters must be abolished.
? The development of European, open-source hardware and software should be promoted to strengthen digital s o v e r e i g n t y .
? Public procurement must be based o n strategic and security policy considerations.
? A right to an analog life for citizens: dealing with authorities and using public facilities must also be possible without a digital identity.
? The preservation of cash as an unrestricted means of payment (keyword "digital euro").
? No digital recording of all assets in an EU central register.
Health policy must remain a national responsibility.
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, it has become clear that the EU's influence in health policy is also increasing at the expense of individual states. The result is a massive expansion of the influence of the EU Commission and the EU agencies EMA, ECDC, HERA and, in future, EHDS on the health policy of the nation states. In future, the EU Commission will be able to declare pandemics and health emergencies without the approval of the EU Parliament. The epidemic control authority (ECDC) is then authorized to monitor the health policy of countries, intervene and send emergency assistance teams to the countries. Decisions in EU institutions with questionable legitimacy and, not least, the case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) are intended to dictate to citizens how they should deal with eminently important health issues and what restrictions they should accept on their personal freedom of choice. We call for clarification under EU law that health policy remains the responsibility of national parliaments. We also firmly reject the transfer of competences to the WHO.
¦ No further privatization of hospitals
In recent decades, there has been a steadily increasing trend towards the privatization of hospitals. The market share of privatized hospitals nationwide is now around one third and has thus reached a critical size to jeopardize the diversity of public, non-profit and private owners required by German law. As critical infrastructure, hospitals must remain predominantly in public or non-profit ownership. The public sector's statutory mandate to ensure safety must also be guaranteed. The AfD therefore rejects any influence by the EU on the operation and financing of hospitals in Germany as well as further privatization. This also applies analogously to inpatient care facilities and medical care centers (MVZ).
¦ Securing the supply of medicines
A nationwide network of owner-managed pharmacies is still essential to ensure a nationwide supply of medicines, which is particularly important for structurally weak regions, as local pharmacies are one of the key prerequisites for regional structural policy. However, this regionally anchored supply model is threatened by the increasing sale of prescription medicines. For this reason, most EU countries have banned or severely restricted mail-order sales. In Germany, too, the mail-order sale of medicines should no longer be permitted. Non-prescription medicines can still be sold over the Internet without any restrictions.
In order to avoid supra-regional supply bottlenecks, it must be ensured that medicines used in Germany are produced exclusively in Europe. In addition, pharmaceutical wholesalers in Germany should be obliged to keep at least an average two-month requirement of supply-relevant pharmaceuticals in stock at all times. Short distances and the strengthening of domestic production should be promoted.
¦ No medical treatment in the sense of "gender mainstreaming"
Following the changes to the law in May 2021 ("Act on the Protection of Children with Gender Development Variants"), gender reassignment surgery is now much easier in Germany, even for minors without the consent of their legal guardians. This includes the use of so-called "puberty blockers" to pharmacologically delay the sexual development of minors and to prepare for surgical interventions in the sense of "gender reassignment". The consequences for adolescents are irreversible; the lifelong physical and psychological damage is immense.
What already exists in legal form in Germany is to be introduced at EU level as binding "law" for all citizens. We strictly reject this. Early sexualization in childcare facilities and schools, which is intended to encourage this, must also be resolutely opposed.
¦ No compulsory vaccination
The Standing Committee on Vaccination (Stiko) lists a comprehensive table of standard vaccinations that are only explicitly recommended and are therefore subject to the personal responsibility and self- determination of citizens. A state-generated vaccination printout (e.g. for Covid-19) and a digital vaccination certificate planned by the EU would be the first steps towards further state-prescribed vaccinations, including mRNA injections. In this way, the state is restricting citizens' right to self- determination over their own bodies, which is enshrined in the German Basic Law, in violation of fundamental rights and is shifting the decision to vaccinate from the personal to the state level, where a decision in favor of vaccination is to be forced through massive pressure, including the deprivation of citizens' economic livelihoods. A free and legally effective vaccination decision is impossible under these circumstances. The fundamental right to physical integrity and the right to self-determination must not be infringed under any circumstances.
¦ Stop all corona vaccinations
Due to the disproportionately high incidence of severe vaccine damage, alarming excess mortality, the toxic spike effect and proven vascular damage that can affect any organ, we call for the EU Commission to stop the approval of mRNA and vector-based corona injections and for a broad and public investigation by an independent body. We consider a legal review of the approval of corona injections by the EU Commission on the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency to be indispensable. In the meantime, more and more warning voices are being heard from the fields of medicine and science, especially from gynecologists and pediatricians. There are even warning voices from the funeral profession! These people must be heard clearly and their warning signals must be examined seriously and independently. In order to involve the public in the investigations, citizens should be directly involved and those affected by the coronavirus in particular should be able to report on their experiences. We also demand the full rehabilitation of all citizens who have suffered legal disadvantages and legal proceedings in the course of the corona crisis due to their critical stance on state vaccination and corona policy.
¦ 
Preserving the profession of alternative practitioner
The ECJ has confirmed the ban on alternative practitioners practising their profession in Austria, thereby making it clear that the activity of alternative practitioners is not worthy of protection. In Germany, too, there are efforts to severely restrict or completely ban the practice of this profession. For the AfD, the possibility of using the services of alternative practitioners is part of the patient's self-determination over their body and their personal health care. Every patient should decide on their own responsibility about the medical measures that affect them. State paternalism in this highly personal area must be firmly rejected. This should not involve an obligation to reimburse costs by the statutory health insurance providers.
¦ Only deploy personnel qualified to German standards
Trust cannot be built up with doctors, therapists, pharmacists or nurses who have language deficits, nor can misunderstandings in the treatment process be ruled out. Employing foreign staff, who often have language deficits, is therefore not a solution to the staff shortage in the healthcare sector. Medical staff must have good language skills and their professional qualifications must fully meet German standards. The shortage of doctors must be addressed primarily by increasing the number of university places, especially as there is no shortage of qualified applicants in Germany.
¦ Medical technology
The new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) adopted by the European Parliament, which is directly transposed into national law, poses enormous bureaucratic challenges for German manufacturers of medical devices, which are also associated with considerable costs for the companies (and ultimately for the end user of the medical devices). Every medical device already on the market will have to be retroactively certified under the aforementioned directive by
July 22, 2022, which was probably not even possible.
Although this deadline has now been extended for individual product groups, the many smaller manufacturers in Germany (mainly in south-west Germany) cannot cope with the bureaucratic burden, especially as the number of certification bodies is far too small. It is in the interests of the many innovative, small (and also larger) medical technology companies in Germany to work towards the introduction of grandfathering for products already on the market. These tried and tested products would then be recognized as certified following an unbureaucratic registration process.
¦ Preventing the misuse of medical data
The planned European Health Data Space (EHDS) is intended to enable the use of individual health data for the general public. It would be another bureaucratic monstrosity, harboring considerable potential for abuse and leading to a restriction of personal freedoms. Personal health data is not a public good. It is an expression of individuality worthy of protection and requires the utmost discretion. It must never be at the disposal of political and commercial desires and ideological interests. For this reason, the AfD strictly rejects the centralized storage of patient data at EU level.

Family policy
¦ Family and demographics
The family is the heart of every society and therefore enjoys special protection in Germany under the Basic Law. All people have the right to freely choose their marital status. Other forms of cohabitation than marriage between a man and a woman are to be respected, but are not to be treated equally. In its family policy, the AfD is committed to the classic model of the family, in which father and mother take permanent joint responsibility for their children. The unique and privileged position of father and mother with regard to the protection of the child's welfare and upbringing must be fully preserved. We strive for equal opportunities for women and men and support people living traditional gender roles.
¦ Children are meaningful, enriching and vital
Without families with children, our European societies, our cultures and our freedom cannot exist. That is why the needs of children are at the heart of our family policy.
Not only Germany, but almost all European countries are struggling with the resulting problems of low birth rates and an ageing society. Many governments are trying to compensate for the population decline through immigration, although this has been proven to be unsuccessful and leads to massive cultural and social problems when living together. The AfD, on the other hand, wants to encourage and support significantly more young couples to start a family and have several children. The support should go well beyond what is already being implemented in France, Poland and Hungary. Children are the future!
¦ Strengthening the personal responsibility of families
Families are best able to manage their own affairs independently and on their own responsibility. Only if this is not possible should help for self-help be provided. The AfD calls for this to take place exclusively at national level. The EU is not responsible for family policy. It must therefore not interfere in families, influence their life plans or even control them through quotas. By increasingly taking over areas of social and family policy, the European Union is violating the f u n d a m e n t a l principle of subsidiarity to which it has committed itself. The AfD will vigorously oppose this. We strictly reject any link between financial contributions and the implementation of ideological goals. Legislative competence on all ethical and family policy issues, in particular the right to life, self-determination, marriage and divorce, must remain with the nation states.
¦ Recognizing the social achievements of families
Everyone benefits from the services provided by the families. However, the costs, the work and the sacrifices required are largely borne by the families. Due to this equity gap, fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have children.
The rapid decline in the number of multi-child families in the middle classes and the high number of childless people among the top performers are the main reasons for the demographic catastrophe in Western societies
and for the resulting shortage of skilled workers. Added to this is the very low esteem in which parents and their educational work are held by politicians, the media, the economy and society. Families are at a disadvantage compared to those without children. The AfD therefore advocates national concepts to improve the quality of life of families.
¦ Abortions must become the exception
The right to life is a fundamental human right. It is diametrically opposed to the desire for abortion. Without the right to life, no other human right can be claimed. Every human being is a human being from the moment of fertilization (ECJ ruling C-34/10). Abortion must therefore become the absolute exception,
e.g. in the case of criminological or medical indications.
Influential groups in the EU are currently trying to make abortion the norm, or even the norm.
"human right". Some even describe the lack of abortion options as "torture". This would also overturn the balanced regulation of § 218 StGB in Germany. The AfD will resolutely oppose this grotesque trivialization and trivialization of infanticide in the European Parliament.
The AfD rejects any EU funding for organizations or measures that promote abortion. We are committed to ensuring that mothers receive comprehensive support during pregnancy and after birth, especially in difficult circumstances.
On the other hand, more and more unintentionally childless couples are willing to pay money for a child. However, paid surrogacy is a form of child trafficking. We therefore reject a "right to have a child" and commercial surrogacy. Adoption can be a solution to both problems, but should continue to be regulated at national level.
¦ Stopping gender ideology
It is a biological fact and not a social construct that there are exactly two genders: Woman and man. The pseudo-science of gender ideology denies this basic biological fact. The EU must stop all promotion of this scandalous ideology immediately.
Gender ideology causes the greatest damage to children and young people during puberty. It massively impairs their development and in many cases causes permanent damage. The AfD is calling for a ban on "sex changes" for minors and a rigid restriction of drug treatments, e.g. with puberty blockers.
¦ Child benefit as required
In 2021 alone, around 459 million euros of German tax revenue was paid abroad as child benefit - regardless of the living conditions of the children in the recipient countries. This is unfair and creates considerable incentives for social migration. The existing regulation must be amended by correcting EU Regulation 883/2004.

Education and research
¦ No to the "European Education Area"
Although the Basic Law stipulates that education policy is a matter for the federal states, the federal government and the EU are arrogating more and more powers to themselves in the field of education. At European level, these have long since gone beyond what is reasonable, such as the organization of exchange programmes. The EU Commission often adopts the agenda dictated to it by various interest groups and lobby groups. The common goal of these players is to create a largely standardized, centralized "European Education Area" that does not follow the humanistic ideal of education and in which students are not encouraged to think independently. This is evidenced by EU-driven programs such as "Education for Sustainable Development" (ESD), inclusion and gender mainstreaming. The AfD rejects the creation of a "European Education Area". We will take back from the EU the competences it has acquired in the area of education or which have been transferred to it by the member states.
¦ Strengthen the autonomy of universities: Restore freedom of research and teaching
The EU also wants to further standardize the European education area in academic education. This would perpetuate the quality reductions introduced by the Bologna Process. We demand: Germany must once again become a country of independent top-level research. The ideological influence of politics, for example in the areas of climate research, medical research and migration research, must be reduced. Science must reflect the controversial nature of professional debate. Basic research must be strengthened.
Universities should have the right to select applicants through entrance examinations. Quota regulations for improved access opportunities and degree qualifications for supposedly disadvantaged and underrepresented groups contradict the merit principle of our education systems. However, this is precisely the approach of the EU Commission, whose ideological projects, such as genderism, multiculturalism or identity politics, undermine the merit principle of our federal education system.
The AfD wants to restore the high academic standards of German universities. Diploma and master's degree courses must be possible again. We reject an artificial increase in the proportion of academics, as demanded by the EU. The dual study programme opens up high-quality, highly practice-oriented and tailor- made specializations and is therefore another suitable way to effectively counter the shortage of skilled workers.
¦ Strengthen dual training, master craftsman examination and dual studies
The EU wants to establish a "truly common European education area" by 2025. There is a risk that our successful German dual training system - similar to academic training in the Bologna Process - will be devalued. The successful system of dual training and dual studies in Germany must be preserved and can serve as a model for other European countries. For this reason, the AfD is calling for the educational qualifications awarded in the dual system in Germany to be placed on an equal footing with the academic qualifications awarded in other European countries.
¦ 
"Inclusion" - but the right way
The requirement of the United Nations and the EU to guarantee disabled children participation in the education system has been met in Germany with the special school system. Inclusion at any price is at the expense of the quality of education for all those involved. The AfD therefore advocates the preservation of special schools and inclusion with a sense of proportion.
¦ The EU's ideological assault on German children and prevent young people
The EU is promoting the ideologization of our young people from nursery school onwards through a variety of programmes. We demand: Educational institutions must not be a place of political indoctrination. Due to the increasing influence of the EU, German educational institutions are teaching "attitudes" instead of knowledge. However, the model of education in the sense of the Enlightenment must be the responsible citizen with his or her own judgment. We reject the economization and ideologization of education and call for a return to the humanistic ideal of education. Gender language makes language acquisition and meaningful reading more difficult throughout Europe. We reject the unnatural transformation of language as a means of enforcing gender ideology. We reject any form of gender language. The generic masculine is the correct, natural and ideology-free form of expression and writing. The use of gender language in educational institutions by teachers and pupils is not permitted. We therefore firmly reject the deduction of marks or other disadvantages for the use of the generic masculine. The gender ideology already practised in nurseries devalues the right of parents to education, which is protected by the German Basic Law, and unsettles children in their sexual identity and natural development.
¦ Digitization with understanding and a sense of proportion
With its "Action Plan for Digital Education" and the "Governance of School Education Systems", the EU is also attempting to gain new responsibilities in this area in violation of the principle of subsidiarity. As the consequences of completely digitalized teaching have not yet been researched, we fear negative effects on the welfare of children. We reject the introduction of advertising into the classroom in connection with digitalization, as well as the economization of the educational process or the monopolization of teaching media and their content.
The teacher is and remains the most important reference person for all pupils; they must therefore retain responsibility and control for the educational process in the classroom. This also applies to the use of new forms of artificial intelligence. All efforts to digitalize teaching in general and to remove the acquisition of knowledge from the analogue learning process must be rejected.
¦ Horizon Europe" research program and others
The European Union's research and innovation funding activities are pooled in the ideologically driven "Horizon Europe" program with a budget of 95 billion euros over seven years. In addition, there are considerable further EU funds which place the funding under the "climate sustainability aspect". The following topics will be addressed, among others: Culture, creativity, inclusive society, security for civil society, climate, energy, mobility, food, bioeconomy. The allocation of funds by the politically appointed European Science and Innovation Council is a targeted intervention in scientific freedom. In addition, topics that are considered particularly important politically are
4S	4D
The company is also pursuing a number of missions, such as achieving "climate resilience" and designing "climate-neutral" (e.g. car-free) and "smart" cities.
The AfD stands for unrestricted freedom of research and technological openness to solve societal challenges. We see scientific curiosity, scientific progress and the needs of citizens and market participants as the drivers of innovation. Innovations do not arise from state institutions that pursue socio-political or scientifically unfounded goals.
The AfD welcomes international cooperation, as is common practice in the scientific community. It is committed to subsidiarity and wants to keep research funding under national sovereignty wherever possible.
Our demands are therefore as follows:
? O penness to technology and freedom of research without ideological promotion.
? Reduce European research and innovation funding, no successor program to "Horizon 2020", dissolve European Science Council.
Respect subsidiarity: Research and innovation funding in national hands or on the basis of bilateral and multilateral agreements between member states.
? The AfD's goals are to strengthen the self-sufficiency of EU member states in key industries (defence technology, energy supply, mobility, digitalization including cryptography, health and food supply) and to diversify basic research.
? End market distortions, abolish technology bans (combustion engine, oil/gas heating).
The exceptions that we want to tackle sensibly through international cooperation include major projects such as the European space program, Euratom's activities in research on advanced nuclear power plants and fusion research.
Cultural policy
Europe's cultural wealth lies in the diversity of its traditions, languages and regions. The EU's cultural policy
- together with UN institutions and non-governmental organizations - pursues the goal of dissolving this European diversity into an artificially created uniform culture. Measures for inclusion, equal opportunities, diversity and gender equality not only ensure quotas in cultural funding, but also create an ideological pressure to conform. The fight against "racism" and "discrimination", which European societies are supposedly structurally riddled with, is also being promoted by the EU. This creates a repressive cultural climate in the sense of ever more rigid "political correctness" and a "cancel culture" towards all dissenting positions. In addition, the subordination of European cultural policy to the goals of the "Green Deal" contributes to the ideologization of cultural life. The AfD is strictly opposed to these efforts and also adheres to a Europe of nations in cultural terms.
¦ Defending the cultural sovereignty of nations
The AfD supports the idea of subsidiarity. In Germany, cultural policy is a matter for the federal states and must be allowed to develop. The EU's multi-million euro cultural framework programs lead to ideological control that works towards a "United States of Europe" and undermines the leading national cultures.
¦ 
Preserving cultural heritage
The AfD is committed to the preservation and maintenance of German and European cultural heritage. EU funds should only be made available for emergencies in order to prevent the loss of cultural assets. We reject the current compulsion to cooperate between different EU Member States in order to obtain funding. The allocation of funds must not be tied to framework conditions of political correctness, such as gender mainstreaming or diversity requirements.
¦ No culture of guilt and shame
The AfD counters the widespread European tendency to tell the colonial history of European nations as a history of crimes with a differentiated view of the German and European colonial era. The culture of guilt and shame that post-colonialist ideology wants to establish throughout Europe does not do justice to the historical facts. We therefore reject it. Renaming streets, toppling monuments or even a "decolonization" of our thinking and speaking do not stem from "historical justice", but from an anti-European, often also "anti- white" affect. We counter this with a self-confident acknowledgement of our own history - with all its light and shadows. We consider the restitution of cultural property from a colonial context to be justified only in a few exceptional cases; it must not become the rule.
¦ For freedom and independence of social media
Free journalism that is independent of the state and the opportunity for every citizen to express themselves freely on social media and exchange ideas with others within the framework of what is permitted by law are indispensable prerequisites for a functioning democracy. The AfD therefore rejects all EU efforts to exert control over the media, censor third-party media offerings or restrict freedom of expression, as expressed in initiatives such as the "European Democracy Action Plan", the "Digital Service Act" or the so-called "Media Freedom Act". In particular, we oppose all attempts by the EU to establish Europe-wide media supervision and regulation that bypasses national competencies.

 Dear voters 
 and voters, 
On June 9, 2024, you have the choice. We are faced with the decision as to whether we will receive what we
and strengthen that which protects us. Nothing less than our peace and prosperity is at stake. This is the basis for social and societal cohesion in a united Europe.
Where we come from: a Europe that creates peace
It is the greatest achievement of our continent: where just a few decades ago Europeans fought against each other on the battlefield, trust and cohesion now prevail. Where once front lines and barbed wire separated us, and later walls and border posts, we are now united by our commitment to freedom, the rule of law and democracy.
Enemies have become neighbors, neighbors have long since become friends.
In a world full of conflicts, the idea of the European Union stands as a guarantor of protection and peace: it was not so long ago that many still took this for granted. This certainty was shattered at the latest with the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine.
This war is directed against the will of Ukrainians to live in peace and freedom. It is directed against their desire to be and remain part of the European family. But it is also directed against internationally enshrined European values such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights - and reminds us of the protection the European Union offers us all. In order to preserve this protection, these values must also be upheld in the European Union.
every day. This also means issuing a clear rejection of anti-democratic, nationalist and right-wing extremist forces.
In a world whose challenges do not stop at national borders, a strong and united Europe can provide the security and prosperity that so many people long for and assume responsibility as a global player. If we strengthen freedom, democracy and human rights internally, the European Union can also convincingly represent them externally as a fair and responsible partner in the global community.
Where the assertiveness of the individual nation state ends, that of the European Union only begins.
Against this backdrop, we want to protect Europe so that it protects us. We want to strengthen it because it makes us strong. We want to secure its ability to act in order to preserve freedom.
Where we want to go: a Europe that increases prosperity for all
Peace and prosperity are inextricably linked in the European idea. Moreover, their linkage was the starting point of European unification: The interests of the individual states were to be so closely interwoven that war would henceforth be "not only unthinkable, but materially impossible".
It was a gamble. And it succeeded. From the ruins of war and destruction emerged a political order with shared values, based on democracy and the rule of law.
on freedom and solidarity - the indispensable complement to economic unification.
Now we are facing the next big task. Growing tensions in the world, social injustice, technological change and the climate crisis as a catalyst for all of this: they present us and our society, the economy and politics with new challenges. We must therefore do more than simply maintain existing prosperity. We define prosperity in terms of fairness, climate neutrality, quality of life and provision. This is the foundation for personal financial security and a life in dignity. We must now move forward where the jobs and prosperity of the coming decades will be created, create social security and at the same time preserve our natural resources. In this way, we can turn the promise of prosperity for all Europeans into reality.
Strengthening Europe and protecting the climate is therefore not an end in itself; we do it to protect and increase your prosperity, freedom and security.
We want to create an infrastructure union: of solar plants and wind farms, of hydrogen networks and fiber optic lines, of power lines and railways, but also of modern hospitals and educational facilities
- of institutions and standards that strengthen justice and protect your rights, for consumer protection and fair wages, against arbitrariness and exploitation. An infrastructure union that brings us closer together in Europe and
more sustainably, thus strengthening our cohesion and enabling innovation and progress. We want to connect Europe quite literally.
The climate crisis is global and must be solved globally. At a time when China and the USA in particular are finally investing massively in the climate-neutral modernization of their economies, we need an equally formative, strategic European investment policy to ensure that Europe can compete internationally and become the first climate-neutral business location. For such a policy, we need investments that
but it pays off. When we protect the climate socially and ecologically, we create: good jobs, clean infrastructure and secure prosperity.
However, good policy not only builds infrastructure, but also reduces bureaucracy: it regulates where necessary to safeguard the common good, maintains important standards of protection and participation
- at the same time, however, turns back unnecessary regulation that slows down the economy and society, inhibits investment and makes everyday life more difficult.
Digitalization that serves people and the harmonization of regulations and standards at different levels and countries, as made possible by the European Union, will help.
By securing the competitiveness of our companies in the markets of the future, we are laying the foundations for good jobs and fair wages, for attracting skilled workers and employees and for security in uncertain times. We don't just want to increase our prosperity for the few, we want to ensure that it reaches the many: across the breadth of society.
We pursue this claim.
By putting our prosperity on a climate-neutral footing and using fewer resources, we are protecting perhaps our most critical infrastructure: our environment and our climate, our biodiversity and the diverse nature of which we are a part. We have felt the consequences of climate change more and more drastically in Europe and around the world i n	recent years. Extreme weather such as heatwaves and floods have cost lives, homes and harvests, prosperity
and jobs destroyed. The extinction of species and the pollution of nature are endangering the ecosystems on which we are directly dependent. It is also in our own best interest to stop this trend: That is why we want to protect the climate, but also protect ourselves from the changing climatic conditions and adapt to them. We have taken important steps in this direction with the European Green Deal. We want to continue along this path.
By investing in the locational advantages of tomorrow - renewable energies and rapid
Digitalization, state-of-the-art battery technology and green steel or the education of our children and liveable villages - we are building a Europe that offers protection: for its citizens, for you and for all of us.
We know that: All of this can only succeed on a European level. European
But sometimes it works.
The way there: attitude and responsibility
We want to take responsibility. That is why we ask for your trust. We stand for a policy that does not drown out, but convinces. For a policy with clear goals that also builds bridges to common solutions. For a policy that provides answers.
What gives us strength are the successes of the last legislative period. We have met the corona and energy crisis with European solidarity. European climate protection has moved in the direction of the Paris climate targets - thanks to the expansion of renewables and, for example, the phasing out of combustion engines. And large digital companies are now following democratic rules.
We want to make the European Union more democratic and closer precisely because we know that we can achieve more together than by going it alone at national level. We want Europe, absolutely
- but even better. Better for you. A Europe as it could be.
We are prepared to jump over our shadows if it means that we can make progress together.
Responsibility that is taken seriously always means compromise. There
We have our clear values behind us as strength and orientation; they are our guiding principles. One thing is clear: human rights apply without restriction and are non-negotiable. At the same time, European progress, especially in a Europe of diversity, has never been a supposedly pure doctrine, never for or against, never black or white. However, anyone who rejects compromise as such is concerned with being right, not with finding solutions; they accept that trust
democracy is eroding; it accepts that the unity of Europe will suffer.
Europe has experienced both: the darkest chapters of our history, but also the ability of people to open new chapters, fight for freedom and defend democracy. The European Union may be exhausting at times and yes, it needs to improve. But it remains the key to a life of prosperity and security. Today, when we are faced with several tasks of the century, all of them man-made, even if their simultaneity and magnitude may seem overwhelming at times, we as Europeans know that the answer will be the same: The answer will be the same - man-made and European.
What counts in all of this is not who wins or who is right. Success has no political color.
Success is what makes life better for people in Germany and Europe. What makes us stronger together. What holds our society together. What also protects you.
BÜNDNIS 90 / DIE GRÜNEN are competing for the best ideas for such a policy. Such a policy is our offer to you.
We ask you for your trust in this path: Vote for Alliance 90/The Greens.
 What protects prosperity 
From small craft businesses to regionally anchored SMEs and large international companies: Europe's diverse and innovative economy is globally competitive - and Germany benefits from European integration and the single market like no other member state. Products and services from Thuringia or Hesse are traded between An- dalusia and Lapland, between Riga and Nicosia, as if these places were only a few kilometers apart. We are also the fourth strongest economy in the world because we join forces at European level.
Europe makes us strong. Strengthening Europe is therefore in our own best interests. We have already come a long way - with the Green Deal, we have set the right course across the EU. From 2050, Europe should no longer emit any greenhouse gases. Above all, it is now a matter of moving forward where the strength of the coming years and decades will come from, also and especially in order to bring the economy in line with planetary boundaries. We have a plan for this: the climate-neutral modernization of our economy and infrastructure. For us, this is not an end in itself, but also the key to competitiveness and prosperity, to quality of life, to good jobs and fair wages, to securing our natural resources - and thus to a stable basis for more social cohesion. security and social cohesion throughout the EU.
We are doing everything we can to ensure that Europe does not stand on the sidelines while China or the USA invest massively in the development of their location and future technologies. We accept the challenge: We want Germany and the EU to be at least on a par with their international partners in the markets of the future - in renewable energies
and hydrogen, in digital services and artificial intelligence (AI), in state-of-the-art batte-
technology and green steel. This makes Europe a pioneer for sustainable solutions and can define that new technologies are used for the benefit of people. This is a question of independence. Today, economic policy is also security policy. This also means that we protect critical infrastructure and strategically important industries from geostrategically motivated takeovers.
Europe's prosperity and quality of life are directly linked to its natural foundations - with fertile soils, near-natural forests and clean waters, with habitats for a wide variety of species, with intact nature on our coasts and in our landscapes. In their interplay, agriculture thrives in the immediate vicinity of high- tech companies, craft businesses are anchored in livable rural areas, and it is possible to travel from the cities to attractive cultural and natural landscapes for recreation in a short time.
Prosperity in Europe means fairly paid jobs, affordable housing and good public services in a functioning economy. It means justice and a fair social division of burdens and labor, not least between the sexes. But prosperity also means clean air, clean water and affordable, good food.
We are setting out to renew our prosperity by placing it on a climate-neutral foundation - one that will last for years and decades to come. We have put the European Green Deal on the agenda and it is the right strategy. We are continuing to fight for its continuation and full implementation. We are now ensuring thatithasan impact in all areas: from energy generation to mobility and agriculture to industrial policy. After all, climate protection and climate resilience are increasingly becoming decisive competitive factors.
and location factors. If we want to preserve our prosperity and create new ones, we Europeans must not only protect the climate, but also embrace this competition.
The prerequisite for this is an active European economic and industrial policy that enables innovation and builds sustainable infrastructure; that has the courage to make targeted strategic investments; that makes us independent of the autocracies of this world - and thus makes all our lives crisis-proof and affordable. We therefore want to expand renewable energies, the electricity grids and the hydrogen core network throughout Europe now - from solar energy from southern Spain to wind over the North Sea. We want to promote a modern and functioning rail network for climate-neutral travel from Florence to Flensburg and from Budapest to Barcelona and thus make our rail network truly pan-European. If we want to turn the European Union into a modern infrastructure union, then we will do so in order to secure production by industry and trade, electricity and heat, affordable energy and climate- friendly mobility for all - sustainably and in line with people's needs.
When we invest in research and development, we do so so that the best ideas continue to feel at home on our continent. When we reduce bureaucracy, we do so in order to put the EU at the service of Europeans, not paragraphs and authorities, without restricting quality standards. And when we use the potential of digitalization, we do so tomake data usable for the benefit of the people of Europe, not the other way around.
No country in Europe is up to these tasks alone. But together we are. Together in the EU, we are in a position to provide political answers that are effective and powerful enough to deal with global warming and systemic competition in equal measure.
This is the path we are taking. We want a fair and effective EU that creates security in the here and now - and at the same time sets the course for the future.
the prosperity and cohesion of tomorrow. We want an EU in which prosperity is created in harmony with nature and the climate. And we want an EU in which social or geographic origin, access to education, disability, gender or religious beliefs do not determine the chance of a good life. All people should be able to share in prosperity and contribute to it.
We are standing up for this Europe. This is the Europe we want to be.
1. A climate-neutral Europe
Investing in energy security
In order to achieve the climate targets, Europe needs a genuine energy union with an efficient and sustainable energy supply that utilizes and combines the potential and cost advantages of renewable energies across the entire continent.
We are massively expanding renewable energies throughout the EU as part of an active economic and industrial policy: By 2035, they should make a significant contribution to securing the EU's energy supply on the way to 100 percent climate neutrality. Because only renewables guarantee an independent and affordable energy supply in the long term, with which Europe can operate competitively in the long term. We want Germany to set a good example on this path.
To achieve this, we need an increase in energy efficiency and decarbonization intransport, industry and heat supply throughout Europe in the coming years, massive investments in the expansion of wind power, photovoltaic, solar and geothermal plants, energy storage systems of all kinds as well as waste heat recovery and heat pumps. In future, we want to work together even more closely on a European level in order to continuously develop the necessary requirements in unison.
In order to reliably transport electricity to where it is needed throughout the EU, we want to strengthen the European electricity grid as part of the Infrastructure Union and, above all, massively expand the connections between the member states. A decentralized, stable and interconnected European electricity grid makes us more resilient and increases our security of supply. The energy crisis showed this very clearly when the countries of Europe were at each other's mercy.
were able to do. We now want to make it fit for 100 percent renewable energies. This will enable us to exploit synergies in the EU, where the wind is always blowing or the sun is always shining somewhere. We are establishing integrated European grid planning - especially for c r o s s - b o r d e r projects and the expansion of wind energy in the EU's seas. In future, electricity grids, hydrogen grids, gas grids and heating grids must be considered together. We are gearing the electricity market design, grid fees and the regulation of energy storage systems of all kinds towards a system based on 100 percent renewable energies and the integration of the transport, heating and industrial sectors. The new electricity market design must allow electricity consumers to benefit from the cost advantages of renewable energies.
and at the same time secure the refinancing of
renewables. The price of renewable electricity should be decoupled from the rising costs of emissions trading. The decentralized nature of renewable energies allows many people and companies to generate their own electricity. The use of self-generated electricity should be encouraged through a favorable legal framework, as it not only brings them cost advantages, but also relieves the burden on the grids and thus the general public. Production peaks of renewable energies for which there is no use in the electricity grid should be able to be easily used on site, for example for electrolysis, in batteries or heat storage, in accordance with the principle of "use instead of shutting down".
Generations of people in the coalfields have made a valuable contribution to energy security, progress and our business location. We are building on this commitment and this expertise in the European energy
regions. However, coal is becoming increasingly unprofitable, is also the most harmful form of energy production in terms of climate and health and therefore has no future. We will create the conditions for ending coal-fired power generation in the EU. We will support the coal regions in their transition to new energies by 2030. We reject new obligations to pay compensation for the phase-out of fossil fuels. With new infrastructure, economic development, renaturation and innovation promotion, we are enabling the affected regions to make the transition to renewable energy.
regions are taking this path into the future. Companies, local authorities and a wide range of civic projects are crucial to the success of this comprehensive structural change. In this way, we ensure that the newly created prosperity reaches the local people and create reliable structures.
At the same time, the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine in particular has shown us how dependent we still are on natural gas and the difficulties this entails. In the coming years, in line with our climate targets, it will therefore be necessary to say goodbye to the development of new oil and gas fields once and for all.
We want to stop using fossil fuels to generate electricity in Germany by 2035 at the latest. In doing so, we are supporting the end of the extraction of CO2 sources in Europe and around the world. At the same time, we want to align our economic policy in Germany and Europe in such a way that fossil fuels are also phased out beyond this date.
production and combustion worldwide can be ended by 2050, in line with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. We can and will completely replace the fossil model with renewable energies combined with green hydrogen.
Nuclear power is not a sustainable form of energy generation and is not suitable for combating the climate crisis. It increases import dependencies, is considerably more expensive than renewables, involves high risks and is unreliable, especially in times of heat and drought. We advocate sanctions on uranium imports and Russia's nuclear business. Nuclear
Power plants are not least a threat to t h e safety of the population in war situations. Their construction is expensive and time-consuming. The danger of nuclear proliferation is ever-present, and the waste will burden countless generations to come. The shutdown of the last three nuclear power plants in Germany was therefore a key step towards a future-proof and affordable energy supply and a major success for the anti-nuclear movement. And it is for these reasons that we in the EU are campaigning against nuclear power as a viable form of energy generation. It is wrong to classify nuclear energy as sustainable and to support it with EU funds. We are striving for a comprehensive reform of the Euratom Treaty that makes the safety of decommissioning and nuclear waste disposal a central task and reflects the true costs and risks in the price.
We are excited about the future opportunities and potential of new energy technologies, which is why we want to drive forward the research and development of new ideas and, for example, continue to scientifically investigate storage technologies and nuclear power. Whether fusion or other approaches can make a contribution to energy supply in the future remains the subject of ongoing research, which always takes safety issues into account. Irrespective of this, the accelerated expansion of renewable energies must be implemented immediately and consistently, as it is a safe way forward
to solve the climate crisis - also for the urban agglomerations of the future.
Paving the way to a climate-neutral continent
Real progress has been made: to date, Europe has reduced emissions by around a third compared to 1990. With the "Fit for 55" plan, the EU aims to reduce emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030.
of their emissions compared to 1990. The free allocation of emission allowances to sectors that will fall under the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) in future will be phased out. This reformed emissions trading will make a faster European coal phase-out profitable. We have doubled the expansion targets for renewable
energies. And for fossil fuels
Energy, steel or chemical products imported into Europe will soon have to pay a price for their carbon footprint at the border.
The car industry is switching its production to electric vehicles. Buildings in the EU are being insulated and incentives are being provided for climate-friendly heating. Europe has thus taken the right path.
The EU must resolutely continue on this path to climate-neutral prosperity. Europe should become the first climate-neutral continent. There must be no backing away from this goal and it must be reliably achieved. It is a great success that the EU is moving towards the 1.5 degree pathway. We want an EU climate policy that leads to climate neutrality with clear interim targets based on the scientific recommendations of the EU Climate Council. At the same time, we also want to shape European climate policy in the future in such a way that social cohesion is not jeopardized. We also want to make the interim target for 2035 binding at the United Nations (UN), as all countries have pledged internationally as part of the Paris Climate Agreement. Among other things, the framework for climate protection measures and the European emissions trading systems must be adapted for implementation. The agriculture and fisheries sector must also make its contribution to reducing emissions. In addition to pricing greenhouse gases, the instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) must also be consistently geared towards climate protection.
With the inclusion of methane in emissions trading
and the new methane regulation, the EU has taken important steps to reduce this climate-damaging gas in line with its high warming potential, particularly in the short term. What is needed now is a rapid introduction of requirements for detecting and closing methane leaks in the upstream chain and a threshold for imports of coal, oil and gas into the EU.
Using natural CO2 sinks and technological progress
In order to achieve the climate targets, we need to get out of coal, oil and gas quickly and into renewable energies.
and green hydrogen. In a few sectors, however, there will still be emissions in the future that cannot be avoided using current technology, such as in the cement industry. In these areas, we want to take advantage of technological opportunities and capture the CO2 directly during production, store it in a safe and stable form and, if necessary, use it in closed carbon cycles (Carbon Capture Use
/ Storage, CCU / CCS). Where technically unavoidable emissions occur, this can be actively promoted. In principle, the polluter pays principle applies to funding. We reject the active promotion of CCS for the production of blue hydrogen in Germany. The energy transition and Decarbonization in industry is our priority. This focus will also be reflected in funding. We want to create a uniform Europe-wide regulatory framework for this, including a binding liability law, and develop an integrated European infrastructure
- including joint European CO2 storage facilities. We take into account existing uses, especially at sea, binding ecological criteria and the exclusion of protected areas.
According to analyses by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it will become increasingly difficult to achieve the 1.5-degree pathway in the future. The predicted possibilities of achieving this path require an active reduction in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It is therefore essential to actively reduce them in order to return to a stable and sustainable level. To achieve this, we are researching and developing negative emissions - natural and technical processes thatremove CO2 from the atmosphere in the medium term. Intact ecosystems are our best allies, because
Forests, floodplains, peatlands and oceans in particular are natural CO2 reservoirs. Protecting and restoring such natural CO2 sinks is a priority for us. In addition to the climate, they also have a positive influence on water cycles and the weather. That is why we need
We need smart regulation and increased support for natural climate protection, agriculture, humus formation, the rewetting of
The restoration of peatlands, the renaturation of floodplains and seagrass beds, the sustainable use of wood and the restoration of near-natural, species-rich and structurally rich forests that promote both ecologically and economically sustainable management in the future. To this end, Europe needs a comprehensive "Natural Climate Protection" package to implement the Nature Restoration Law, which also lays the legal foundations for the swift designation of priority areas for forest restoration.
renaturation and natural climate protection. Reducing livestock farming in Europe will also free up more land for the restoration of nature. At the same time, we want to examine the potential of technical negative emissions such as bioenergy with CO2 storage in application and evaluate them in pilot projects. As with other technologies, the principles of precaution and technology assessment apply. The EU needs clear targets for achieving negative emissions without trading them against emission reduction targets.
Using green hydrogen as the energy source of the future
Green hydrogen, i.e. hydrogen from renewable energies, can store energy and make it transportable. It is an important component of our future energy supply, as it can replace fossil fuels in many cases where electrification is not an option. The production of green hydrogen in times of surplus wind and solar power also has a stabilizing effect on the integration of renewable energies into our electricity grid. We want to ensure that Europe becomes a pioneer in the hydrogen economy. In order to reduce the currently quite high costs and efficiency losses in hydrogen production and transportation, we will continue to support research and development in this area of technology. With instruments such as climate protection contracts and a comprehensive investment program, we are ensuring a rapid ramp-up of production of this key technology.
We want to increase investment in a new trans- European hydrogen core network in order to
to transport green hydrogen from the sunny and windy regions of Europe to European industrial centers by converting the existing gas infrastructure and building new pipelines such as H2Med. In order to minimize grid expansion costs and enable regional hydrogen production and use as early as possible, we are accelerating the development of a decentralized hydrogen infrastructure at the same time. We are dovetailing this with the expansion of the electricity grids and a cross-sector European storage strategy that also incorporates the process and waste heat potential of industry. This is part of an efficient infrastructure union.
We are also committed to building a global market for green hydrogen and strategic partnerships for its global trade. Thanks to a large number of potential partner countries, which we also evaluate in terms of democracy and human rights, we can ensure a diversified energy supply and avoid one-sided dependencies. Through fair partnerships at eye level, the sharing of know- how, better access to renewable energies and the protection of local water supplies, we enable the countries of the Global South to integrate themselves into the value chain and benefit from the green energy future. We are committed to high standards for the certification of green hydrogen at European level. We want to avoid importing hydrogen that has not been synthesized using renewable energy wherever possible.
As production capacities first have to be built up, hydrogen will remain a very scarce raw material for the time being. To reduce CO2 emissions, we are therefore focusing primarily on energy efficiency and the electrification of drives, production processes and heating systems, as this is the most efficient way to use green electricity. We therefore want to prioritize the use of hydrogen in areas where electrification is not possible or only possible with great difficulty. This includes the production of basic materials such as steel, glass, paper or chemical products, heavy goods transportation and the transport of goods.
intercontinental sea and air transportation. In the future, we will also use green hydrogen to generate electricity when solar and wind power generation is low and loads are particularly high, if this is economically necessary or to ensure security of supply with renewable energies at all times.
Achieving climate neutrality in a social and citizen-oriented way
Climate neutrality secures and increases prosperity, but is also associated with change. This process demands a lot from all of us. This is not the only reason why climate neutrality must always mean social and gender equality. That is why we want to introduce a climate money as soon as possible. We will evaluate how this can be made socially just in the long term. The climate money will relieve the burden on people with low and middle incomes in particular, who produce less CO2 anyway. With the Social Climate Fund, which is primarily fed from emissions trading, we are giving the member states the means to implement this. It finances benefits for people who are particularly affected by rising energy prices.
and transportation costs are affected. The new European emissions trading scheme for buildings and heating will generate additional revenue. We therefore want the Member States to use these revenues to pay out a per capita climate bonus - as is already the case in Austria with the climate bonus. We will evaluate how this can be designed to be socially fair in the long term.
Renewable energies are citizen energies. They enable people and communities to take their energy supply into their own hands. This shows solidarity and is democratic, as it means that the revenues remain local. The German government has made it much easier for people to use renewable energy themselves. This should apply throughout Europe: The use of community energy is to become even more financially attractive and easier. We want to make it easier for citizens to participate in the energy transition at a European level - by becoming members of a community wind farm, selling the electricity from their photovoltaic system directly to their neighbors or using the electricity generated in their cars to power their homes.
and buffer batteries simply to stabilize the grid.
Renewable energies guarantee that people will still be able to heat their homes affordably in the future. We therefore support the further development of European requirements for the efficiency of buildings and heating systems in order to quickly and cost-effectively free buildings in poor energy condition in particular from their
d e p e n d e n c e on fossil fuels and ensure their long-term affordability. High energy standards for new buildings are another important building block here. When renovating existing buildings, we want to reduce housing costs through targeted investments. In doing so, we are focusing primarily on providing advice as well as socially structured and sufficiently large financial incentives.
We want all Member States to develop municipal heating plans or integrated energy infrastructure plans that show what potential there is for renewables and how waste heat, for example, can be used in an energy-efficient way.
To safeguard the right to clean air, we also advocate strict emissions protection
all systems that use combustion processes. Wood is a valuable natural material that should be used in houses and furniture, also as a CO2 storage medium. As part of cascading use, energy use should be limited to residual and waste wood.
With an efficient and fair electricity market design, transparent infrastructure costs that are as low as possible, greater flexibility on the consumer side and intelligent load management, the benefits of low-cost renewable electricity generation will reach consumers. As a first step, we are protecting the energy market by converting the promotion of renewable energies to two-sided differential tariffs.
contracts with upper and lower limits for electricity generation revenues protect electricity consumers from high costs. The price of renewable electricity should be decoupled from the rising costs of emissions trading. With clear European regulation of energy storage systems of all kinds, we want to drive forward their market i n t e g r a t i o n and provide the urgently needed
Leverage flexibilization potential. In the long term, an electricity market design is needed that ensures the refinancing of renewable energies and at the same time ensuresthat consumers benefit from the cost advantages of cheap wind and solar power.
2. A competitive business location
Investing in innovation, sovereignty and resilience
To make the infrastructure union a reality, we are opting for a strategic European investment policy. The NextGenerationEU (NGEU) recovery program has saved us from a severe crisis during the pandemic and has played a major role in holding the EU together economically and politically. With the end of NGEU in 2026, this important pillar of European investment financing is in danger of breaking a w a y . NGEU can serve as a model for effective joint European financing of major investment projects - such as the development of the infrastructure union.
We therefore want to create a major investment program for innovation, sovereignty and resilience from 2028 with three clear goals: Firstly, we want Europe to continue to grow together through strong common infrastructures as part of the Infrastructure Union - with a fully developed, integrated European rail, electricity and hydrogen network that is adapted to the worsening climate crisis. Secondly, we want to promote the climate- neutral conversion of industry throughout Europe as well as the development of the industries of tomorrow. And thirdly, we want to make our economy and our societies more resilient to and less dependent on autocracies.
Actively shaping industrial policy
Europe is a strong business location with a diverse landscape of small, medium-sized and large companies.
large companies, which is an essential foundation for our prosperity. We will ensure that this remains the case. Two levers are central to this:
Firstly, we are strengthening the internal market,
i.e. the EU's common regulatory framework for companies. This common framework, in which no member state may give its own companies unfair advantages and whose rules set the gold standard in many areas around the world, makes an invaluable contribution to our prosperity, especially for Germany as an exporting country. We will continue to deepen it and defend its foundations.
On the other hand, we have to realize that China in particular, but also the USA with its Inflation Reduction Act, are investing massively in the development of new production sites for key and future technologies. We accept this competition: The EU must counter this with its own active economic and industrial policy that builds on Europe's strengths to reclaim, develop and scale key and future industries. It starts with research and ranges from the training and further education of skilled workers to support for investments. This includes a supply policy that reduces bureaucracy and provides incentives for private investment on the one hand, and strong public funding programs for future technologies such as electrolysers, solar plants, wind turbines, energy storage systems, e- cars and microchips on the other. We want the EU to be at the forefront of the markets of the future and for the products of the future to be conceived and manufactured in the EU. The aim and mission of our industrial policy is to secure jobs and prosperity in Europe by strengthening Europe as a business location and renewing it in a climate- neutral way. The development of a European semiconductor industry is fundamental to the renewal of Europe as an industrial location and serves our economic capacity to act and independence.
We will push for a new start here: A funding jungle has developed in the EU that makes it very difficult for companies to access the available funds quickly and unbureaucratically.
to come. This is a decisive competitive disadvantage - compared to the USA, for example. We advocate a coherent and easy-to-understand industrial policy in which subsidy policy and state aid law also go hand in hand. To this end, we want to transfer relevant parts of the current national industrial policies to the European level, which will be much better funded and put in a position to act quickly and effectively. In addition, we need to mobilize private capital for the climate-neutral renewal of industry. Scaling up the renewable energy industry requires clear targets, strategic management of value chains and a coordinated European structural policy.
Equipping our economy for global competition
European industry can only be competitive in the long term and the EU can only meet its climate targets if industrial production processes become completely climate-neutral. To achieve this, we will renew the industrial base and focus on new value creation opportunities.
More and more companies are investing massively in converting their production. Politicians must create the framework for this: a clear reduction path in European emissions trading. We are bringing it to life by massively expanding renewable energies and the infrastructure for electricity and green hydrogen so that enough green energy is available everywhere at competitive prices.
is available in Europe. Until this is the case to a sufficient extent, we want to ensure, in particular with suitable measures linked to the use of renewable electricity, that energy-intensive companies can also continue to produce in the EU and make the transition to climate neutrality.
This is one of the reasons why we want to support companies with a European programme to decarbonize industry. To this end, we want to finance the EU-wide use of climate protection contracts (carbon contracts for difference) from the EU budget and thus
financially support those companies that convert their production to climate-neutral as quickly and cost-effectively as possible and save the most CO2 in the process. We want to focus on all industrial sectors.
In addition, we want to create European green lead markets for some particularly energy- intensive products from climate-neutral production, such as green steel. To this end, we want to stipulate a minimum quota of green steel for public contracts, for example, which will steadily increase. This will create a new sales market that will trigger climate-neutral production via a market mechanism. We also want to enable industry to make its electricity consumption more flexible and set appropriate incentives so that it can already benefit from the price advantages of renewable energies and reduce grid infrastructure costs. Finally, we also want to significantly accelerate planning and approval procedures for the conversion of production processes to climate- neutral processes, as this contributes to a faster reduction in emissions while at the same time maintaining industrial subs- tance and good jobs.
With the staggered introduction of resilience and sustainability criteria in public tenders and public funding programs, we want to specifically promote the production of these products in the EU. In the long term, we want to orient our economy more towards the common good.
Strengthening the internal market
The EU internal market is central to the prosperity of the EU population and helps to counteract distortions of competition. It is also a key lever for advancing the climate-neutral modernization of our economy. It enables European companies to offer goods and services anywhere in the EU. And it enables employees to work anywhere in the EU. That is why we want to strengthen and deepen the internal market: Where there is one common rule in the EU, companies no longer have to follow 27 different ones.
We are shaping the rules for the single market in such a way that it helps to achieve overarching goals: Democracy, prosperity, social justice, environmental and climate protection and the creation o f	fairly paid jobs. We also want to use the internal market to become more resilient to crises and less dependent on imports of raw materials.
In order to ensure functioning competition for the benefit of consumers and small businesses
we have tightened up competition law in Germany. EU competition law also needs such an update. To this end, we want to revive the New Competition Tool, which the Commission has already proposed.
A strong competition policy that combats the formation ofexcessive market power and prevents subsidy races within the EU as far as possible is what makes the single market a success. We want to maintain this in the future. However, in the struggle for the markets of the future, the EU is now in global competition with other countries that do not adhere to these rules. The EU Commission must therefore create a permanent new state aid framework, particularly for the green technologies of the future, which will enable the member states to pursue a more active, European- coordinated industrial policy and at the same time prevent distortions of competition. This includes faster planning security for state aid procedures as well as exemptions for the support of new production facilities in future technologies and for the conversion of production processes to climate neutrality and the circular economy.
One approach to this is the IPCEI strategic funding projects, with which the EU aims to enable and coordinate the industrial policy of the member states in key sectors such as the development of the European hydrogen infrastructure and the value chains around microelectronics. To ensure greater planning security for companies, the state aid procedures must be accelerated, especially in the context of the IPCEIs.
Train, attract and retain skilled workers
A stable European economy secures our prosperity. With good working conditions, secure jobs, decent wages and further training, we can attract and retain the necessary workers and specialists. This applies equally
for academically trained specialists as well as for those with training in the skilled trades, industry or the public sector. We want everyone to be able to contribute to prosperity - and for it to benefit all those who create it. This is how we grow from the middle. The success of the energy transition also depends on this. This also means that by investing in climate protection, we are simultaneously promoting secure and future-proof jobs.
To achieve this, we need to train young people accordingly, provide further training opportunities for everyone - especially for older workers - and attract skilled workers from outside the country. Refugees who come to us should also be allowed to work and have quick access to language courses. At the same time, we must give women the opportunity to play a full part. In many EU countries, millions of women often work part-time involuntarily or not at all. At EU level, we need a feminist economic, labor market and time policy that takes into account the social infrastructure for reconciling family, work and democratic participation.
We want to make it easier for women to choose a technical - and therefore often well-paid - profession. We want to introduce a bonus that companies and businesses from sectors inwhicha below-average number of women have been employed to date can receive in the allocation of EU funding if they train or employ an above- average number of women. Together with the trade unions and companies, we will develop new ideas on how we can enable equal participation and pay for the sexes in the economy. At the same time, we want to improve the pay, working conditions and recognition of predominantly female occupational fields in a targeted manner.
With their diverse skills, people with disabilities offer great potential as skilled workers. We want to bring about a cultural change towards an inclusive labor market policy and also focus EU funding programs more strongly on this. We want to consistently enforce the legal regulations on the employment and training of people with disabilities and on barrier-free workplaces.
Europe is competing with other regions of the world for skilled workers. From civil engineers and tradespeople to nurses in hospitals. We therefore advocate a comprehensive EU strategy for skilled workers. When recruiting from third countries, the EU Blue Card initiative should be extended to non- academic professions, provided there is a concrete job offer at standard market conditions. At the same time, the recruitment and migration of skilled workers can also lead to serious challenges for the regions of origin. Our aim is therefore for the EU to invest more in the partnership-based training of skilled workers - to the benefit of the labor market in the country of origin as well as in Europe.
Many employees who work in the fossil fuel industry are worried about their livelihoods if their industries are electrified. We therefore want to combine the transition to a climate-neutral economy with well-paid jobs, attractive training and further education opportunities, collective wage agreements and economic and social security, especially in regions that are still structurally weak. Our industrial policy offers a lever for this: we want to link the allocation of EU funds more closely to the fact that training places are available in the region.
social standards are observed and applicable tariffs are adhered to.
3. Stable finances
Arming Europe financially
A key factor in the EU's ability to act is its financial resources: whatever we undertake together in the EU must also be financed to a relevant extent with European funds.
be able to finance them from our own resources. We want to finally meet this requirement, as far- reaching decisions will have to be made over the next five years regarding the financing of our joint European projects well into the 2030s.
We will be guided by two principles: Firstly, we want to improve the financial resources of the EU as a whole through new own resources and higher national contributions. Joint European bonds have also proven their worth in tackling major challenges. Secondly, the EU must be given significantly more room for maneuver in the use of its funds in order to use them for joint investments in strategically important areas such as industrial policy and for an infrastructure union. With this in mind, we will fight for a strong Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the basis for the EU budget, as well as for a new major investment program.
We want the MFF for the years 2028 to 2035 to grow significantly compared to the current one. Germany must also make its contribution to this. We need to specifically strengthen the expenditure items that improve the EU's ability to act in the crucial areas of the future. To this end, we must also critically review the impact of expenditure in the MFF. This applies in particular to the areas in which the Member States manage expenditure.
The protection of our common good requires an EU that is also financially capable of acting.
Especially in times of massively growing tasks, it cannot finance itself in the long term solely from the contributions of the member states. It also needs its own revenues to secure its financial resources in the long term. To this end, we want to enshrine the principle that the majority of revenue generated by European instruments should in principle come from the EU.
benefit the EU budget. In a first implementation step, we want to stipulate that 75% of the potential money creation profits of the Eurosystem will benefit the EU budget in future. 75% of the income from the new CO2 border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) should also go to the EU budget.
To ensure that the upcoming interest and redemption payments for the NGEU program do not lead to a reduction in the EU budget, we want to implement the roadmap for new own resources adopted by the Council and Parliament in 2020 as quickly as possible. In doing so, the financing of the necessary national climate financing in the Member States must be ensured.
Completing economic and monetary union
A stable and cohesive economic and monetary union is a basic prerequisite for prosperity and political and social cohesion in Europe. However, the architecture of the monetary union is still incomplete and Europe therefore remains vulnerable to crises. We want to change this with a comprehensive package of measures.
With the new investment program for innovation, sovereignty and resilience, we are consolidating the common fiscal policy - also as an important buffer in times of crisis. By transferring the European Stability Mechanism to the EU legal framework and switching to majority decisions, we are abolishing national vetoes in crises and finally establishing joint European parliamentary control over future EU aid programs.
By introducing unemployment reinsurance along the lines of the EU short-time work allowance (SURE), we are creating an additional safety net in times of crisis so that the member states can protect jobs. We want to complete the banking and capital markets union to transform the EU from a monetary union into a genuine economic union. By removing structural barriers to cross- border capital flows, we are improving the financing conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), releasing potential for investment and making our financial system more robust at the same time.
A resilient monetary union also needs functioning rules for the budgetary policies of the member states, which ensure that the debt burden is not too high.
ensure viability in all countries at all times and at the same time create enough room for investment and growth. The rules that have been in place for a decade are too restrictive and have prevented necessary investments in many EU member states, while at the same time they were no longer sensible and comprehensible for the European Commission to apply. That is why we are fighting for an ambitious reform that creates more transparency and more scope for investment and whose results are consistently enforced by the Commission.
A crisis-proof monetary union also requires that all member states within the community have the most balanced current account balances possible in order to avoid dangerous imbalances that can arise from undercutting competition in wages, taxes and social security systems, for example. The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) should play an even stronger role in promoting the
climate-neutral renewal of the economy through a politically sharpened mandate.
We support the introduction of the digital euro as a supplement to the book money of commercial banks and to cash, which will remain possible as a barrier-free means of payment.
The digital euro promotes the digitalization of the economy and gives consumers digital access to secure and stable value.
Central bank money. As a public good, it can make a valuable contribution to financial inclusion, the sovereignty of the EU and the stability of our payment system in the digital age.
Shaping financial markets responsibly
Our economy and society depend on functioning financial markets. We want to strengthen the responsibility of all financial market players - for corporate investments, for employees and for the common good. We want to use strong financial market regulation to protect basic needs such as housing and health from speculation. In order to prevent speculation and the focus on short-term goals
the financial markets, we want to create a Introduce a financial transaction tax.
In order to support the climate-neutral renewal of our economy, the financial system must become more resilient and be consistently aligned with the European sustainability goals. This requires clear rules against greenwashing. Every financing decision is a decision about the economy of the future and must therefore also be compatible with our commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement.
The banking sector in the EU is central to financing the investments of companies and citizens in the modernization of our economy. For this reason alone, we cannot afford another banking crisis.
With a significantly higher unweighted capital ratio of at least 10 percent, regular stress tests and the completion of the banking union, we are putting the banks on a stable footing. The interdependence of states and banks should be reduced. This is why we are working at EU level to further reduce concentration risks in bank balance sheets, including through government bonds.
With a European deposit reinsurance scheme that allows the institutional protection schemes of savings banks and cooperative banks to be maintained, a functioning resolution regime andthe separation of lending business with private customers from investment banking at major banks, we can prevent credit institutions from
have to be bailed out with taxpayers' money in the event of insolvency. By obliging banks to gradually reduce the emissions they finance, we ensure that their business is in line with the goal of climate neutrality.
In addition to banks, all other players in the financial sector such as rating agencies, insurers and pension funds must also disclose and take into account climate and biodiversity risks. We advocate greater coherence in European legislation in order to prevent unnecessary bureaucracy - especially for smaller companies.
The EU's green taxonomy is a means of supporting the financing of environmentally friendly economic activities. Therefore, it remains wrong to classify nuclear energy and natural gas as sustainable.
However, sustainability is more complex than a binary yes or no, because we also need strong and innovative suppliers, for example for e-cars or wind turbines, which have not yet been included in the taxonomy. We want to better reflect this in the future. We want to add further gradations to the green taxonomy so that investments in the transition to a sustainable economy are adequately financed. In addition, we want to actively support the EU Commission's proposals for the design of social instruments, such as a social taxonomy, in order to channel investments more strongly into social sectors.
Green investments have become mainstream, as many people want to participate in future- oriented industries and protect the climate at the same time. However, financial supervision has not kept pace with the rapid growth of sustainable financial products. In order to strengthen investor confidence, we therefore want to equip the European financial supervisory authorities with far-reaching powers against greenwash- ing and introduce a state labeling system for sustainable investments. Consumers should have clarity about how a financial product contributes to the climate-neutral modernization of our economy.
We want to make the Capital Markets Union a success. To achieve this, we need to win back the trust of savers. Conflicts of interest due to commissions have meant that savers have far too often been sold expensive, risky or unsuitable financial products. We want commissions to no longer play a role in financial advice in the medium term and for everyone to have access to independent, commission-free advice. This is the only way we can make the potential of the Capital Markets Union accessible to everyone. We want to put an end to misleading formulations, inadequate labels and non-transparent ways in which financial products work.
4. 
Tax justice
Combating tax evasion
The financing of our democratic system depends oneveryone making a fair contribution - for schools and childcare, for hospitals, for a good bus and rail infrastructure. In recent years, courageous whistleblowers and independent media have uncovered a whole series of international tax scandals. They have shown how the super-rich and many large companies use tax tricks to shift profits to low-tax countries: from tax loopholes, letterbox companies and tax havens to tax fraud. These practices shift the tax burden onto citizens, especially SMEs, who rightfully pay their taxes. It is estimated that tax abuse causes losses of more than 170 billion euros annually across the EU. Tax fraud and tax evasion are often cross-border problems. The EU can make an effective contribution to combating this.
We also want to make further progress in the fight against tax avoidance, for example by shifting profits to tax havens. Stricter criteria are needed to ensure that the EU list of tax havens is truly complete. For example, well-known tax havens such as Singapore are currently missing. Countries with a tax rate of zero percent must automatically end up on the EU list of tax havens, such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands. Decisions on which country is placed on the list must be made transparently, according to uniform criteria and impartially.
We also want to significantly improve cross-border cooperation between tax authorities in order to strengthen the EU-wide exchange of tax-relevant information. We welcome the fact that cryptoassets are now also to be fully covered.
We will tackle the abuse of letterbox companies,
i.e. companies that only exist to evade or shift taxes. We call on the member states to adopt the EU Commission's proposal quickly and without watering it down - the EU would be a global pioneer with this legislation. We also want to use AI to detect tax fraud and identify loopholes on a non-discriminatory basis.
Withholding taxes reduce the risk of tax evasion and avoidance, as demonstrated by the cum-ex and cum-cum scandals, as well as the shifting of profits to low-tax countries. We therefore support the EU Commission's plans to introduce an EU- wide system for withholding tax on dividends and interest payments and advocate a further step - an EU-wide minimum withholding tax rate.
Internationally, we must tackle the problem of withholding tax on foreign payments in third countries outside the EU.
End tax dumping
The patchwork of national tax regulations and tax competition between EU member states in terms of corporate tax rates make it difficult to achieve a level playing field in the single market. To counteract this, tax legislation must keep pace with new business models that have become more international, complex and digital. For example, large digital companies with their intangible assets (such as data, knowledge or algorithms) benefit from the fact that corporate profits are taxed at the location of a physical branch or factory and not, for example, where the users of digital services are located. We want to prevent the bakery store around the corner from paying a significantly higher tax rate than
a major international corporation. All companies must contribute their fair share to financing the common good.
A major step has been taken towards fair and effective corporate taxation in Europe: The EU has
- as a result
The two countries have finally agreed on a minimum tax rate of 15 percent for large multinational companies following a breakthrough at the level of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This means that they can no longer escape a minimum standard of taxation.
draw. Implementation in the member states and the European Commission's proposal for a new EU framework for corporate taxation (BEFIT) must now follow. The agreement on minimum taxation is a key step in the reform of the international tax system. However, it is still not enough to ensure that large digital companies, e-commerce or multinational companies in Europe are taxed more fairly. If no progress is foreseeable in the currently faltering negotiations at OECD level in this area, the EU Commission should propose how this goal can be pursued at European level.
Tax transparency is an effective instrument as it makes tax dumping visible to all. The agreement on public country-by-country tax reporting by large companies
in 2021 was a milestone in this sense. When large companies disclose how much tax they pay in the individual EU member states, they
This leads to better control of their tax practices. But not all countries are covered yet. We will work towards using the review clause in the law to improve the directive and achieve a global breakdown of relevant tax data. To prevent destructive tax competition between EU member states, there also needs to be a clear EU framework for tax concessions that individual member states can grant to companies.
We are committed to addressing the market- dominating position of the large auditing firms. This requires a clear separation between auditing and tax consulting, more joint audits and a sustainable reduction in the financial links between auditors and the companies to be audited.
Financing the community in solidarity
Tax justice means that high levels of wealth and billions in corporate profits must make a fair contribution in order to finance the community in a spirit of solidarity, promote climate protection and sustainability and reduce social inequality. The high level of inequality and concentration of wealth in particular has continued to increase throughout the EU.
In order to address these problems, the EU must also be able to act in the area of tax policy. We support the member states in the introduction and implementation of suitable measures to reduce wealth inequality. Efforts to combat tax dumping and tax evasion are repeatedly prevented by vetoes from individual EU member states. We want to exploit the existing possibilities of the treaties to take qualified majority decisions. In the future, overcoming the unanimity principle will open up greater scope for joint action.
As a result of the Russian war in Ukraine, oil and gas companies made extremely high windfall profits from high energy prices. These disproportionate profits made by some of the winners of the crisis are offset by record levels of poverty, which have been exacerbated by a sharp rise in the cost of living. The fact that the EU has agreed on an excess profits tax in this situation, through which the large energy companies return a crisis contribution to society, is a great success.
Part of the current inflation was caused by excessive profits and
is not justified by increased production costs. We call for the instrument of a progressive excess profits tax to be firmly anchored for other areas as well in order to relieve the burden on public budgets in special economic situations. Loopholes such as the small calculation of profits over several financial years or the shifting of profits abroad must be closed.
5. 
Innovative strength and reducing bureaucracy
Anchoring European research at the top of the world
For the great technological, social and economic challenges of our time, we need the combined knowledge of our entire continent and beyond. That is why a European science and research policy that connects people and institutions from all over Europe and supports them in the development of free science is a key element for a future of freedom and prosperity. We want the next major breakthroughs in the areas of climate-friendly mobility, information technology
or the treatment of diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome ME / CFS, cancer or Alzheimer's are conceived and produced in Europe.
Expenditure on research and development must therefore increase significantly in Europe as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP).
At the heart of this is the Horizon Europe program, which bundles the EU's research activities. It is a highly successful funding program that is very popular with applicants and is unparalleled worldwide. We want to expand its scope in the next European financial framework.
European research policy must include free basic research as well as mission- and application- oriented research and transfer. Central to this is climate research, for which we were able to establish a fixed quota of 35 percent for European climate research in the current Horizon Europe cycle.
In future, we also want to establish much stronger funding for biodiversity research. We advocate well- funded basic research - for example in the European Research Council, the excellence research par excellence.
We want to consolidate the Marie Sklodowska Curie mobility funding, which is so important for researchers.
We will continue to campaign for the social sciences and humanities to be given a permanent place in the EU funding framework and for critical sciences to be taken into account, as they are of great importance for a vibrant and resilient culture, society and democracy. By creating a better understanding of social contexts and necessities, they help to overcome multiple crises with holistic solutions. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, teaches us that peace research and research on the countries of Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia must be intensified. We want to promote cooperation between European and Ukrainian universities. We want to continue to strengthen Open Access, i.e. the principle that research results and research data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, as a principle of Horizon Europe and support it in international cooperation.
Horizon Europe is already connected to many partner countries worldwide, which promotes the exchange of knowledge. However, we want to make Horizon Europe more accessible and more international for our researchers. To this end, we want to simplify the application process, reduce bureaucracy and involve more partner countries. In scientific cooperation with non-European partners, it is important to protect European technological sovereignty and guarantee scientific freedom.
Good policy is based on verifiable facts and scientific findings. We advocate standards and transparency guidelines when commissioning scientific studies and expert opinions.
Turning ideas into wealth
Innovation is crucial for Europe's economic future. We want to support ideas on their way from the laboratory to practice. Innovations are a decisive building block for the economic success of tomorrow.
Building on basic research, we are shaping mission- oriented research that helps us to tackle the major challenges of our time and understand their causes: For example, we need a faster roll-out of renewable energy, effective treatments for cancer, smart digital solutions and approaches to tackle social inequality. The missions of Horizon Europe should continue to be guided in particular by the Green Deal. To implement them, we want to bring together universities, institutes, civil society and business.
Innovation policy is an important part of our active economic and industrial policy. We want to expand the transfer-oriented program components of Horizon Europe so that the best ideas are supported on the way to their implementation. In order to make participation in funding programmes more attractive for SMEs, municipal institutions and non- governmental organizations (NGOs), the application and documentation of projects should be simplified as much as possible.
To this end, the EU should also increasingly support regional innovation ecosystems in which science, society, business and the public sector work together on the necessary solutions for the future. Such clusters of research, teaching and practice are key to promoting innovation, accelerating its application and creating climate- neutral prosperity locally. In addition to universities, universities of applied sciences and universities of applied sciences should also be considered. To date, they have often not benefited from EU funding to the same extent as universities, but are particularly strong in applied research. In order to improve this, we want to look at the application and funding conditions of the relevant programs.
We want to make the existing instruments more manageable and faster. This applies, for example, to the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which are particularly dedicated to training young talent, for example in master's or further education programs. By strengthening the
knowledge triangle of higher education, research and innovation, we can give as many people as possible the chance to get involved in key issues of the future.
Transparency and traceability of decisions are also of great importance in this relevant area: the Commission has created a large number of public- private partnerships that manage EU funds together with industry. We would like to launch a transparency initiative here, review existing partnerships and ensure that universities, research institutes and start-ups benefit more from these funding instruments. In addition to proven research formats, long-term studies are also an important contribution to balanced research.
Space is crucial for Europe's technological and strategic sovereignty. Europe must therefore play a leading role in space and needs independent and reliable access to space. We are strengthening the competitiveness of the space industry under the principle of "New Space", for example by promoting new technologies and a European launcher competition. We promote the EU space program, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the astronaut program.
With a European Space Act, we are leading the way internationally, ensuring sustainability and creating growth opportunities and legal certainty for European companies.
Taking off with European start-ups
An innovative corporate landscape needs a lively start-up scene. This is where the start-ups and business models of tomorrow are born. To achieve this, founding must become easier and faster. We want to ensure that there are one-stop stores in every member state. There, founders can find support and advice from a single source. A digital compass should provide an overview of all funding programs for start-ups. Our goal is to make it easy to apply with just one click.
We need a clear responsibility for young companies in the Commission so that the transfer of know-how in the EU is better coordinated. With a European start-up strategy, we are bundling important measures to improve access to venture capital, to attract talent and to public contracts for young companies. The potential of underrepresented groups, especially women and people with a history of migration, should also be better utilized and supported sothattheir ideas have a fair chance of being implemented.
The European Tech Champions Initiative, which the German government has launched together with other EU member states, is an important building block to better support start-ups in the growth phase. In addition, we want to create regular European matching hubs that bring private investors together with founders, a trade fair for business models of the future. Good innovation support also consists of implementing and sustainably securing good and reliable working conditions in science and business.
We want to expand and make greater use of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to strengthen innovative start-ups and climate- friendly industry, especially in cross-border regions.
Promoting SMEs and skilled trades
The innovative capacity and drive of SMEs and the skilled crafts sector are the driving force behind the European economy. Particularly in rural areas, the skilled trades and SMEs provide jobs and stability. They develop, produce, install and maintain future technologies such as solar systems and heat pumps. Europe thrives on cooperation and local problem solvers. However, SMEs, from industry to the skilled trades, are particularly burdened by the introduction of new regulations and bureaucratic hurdles in funding programs. We will therefore improve and consistently apply the SME tests, which assess the impact of new laws on SMEs in line with the "Think
small first" principle should always be reviewed in advance and adjustments made accordingly. We also advocate appropriate exemptions and transition periods for SMEs in new laws and provide support during the changeover. We particularly promote training in the skilled trades. By simplifying application procedures and reducing reporting requirements, we are making it easier for SMEs to access EU funding and investment programs. With the help of fixed SME quotas, we ensure that they actually benefit from these programs. We will standardize the funding landscape in the EU and dovetail it more closely with national funding instruments.
Some legal regulations are now outdated, while others are unsuitable in practice. We advocate a regular review of all regulations in order to simplify bureaucratic requirements and remove regulations that fail to achieve their objective. Where possible and equally effective, we prefer graduated and flexible regulation for companies instead of hard regulation. For example, we want to replace the reporting requirement for overnight stays in tourism and A1 certificates with a more practical approach with pragmatic solutions for small businesses.
A central means of reducing bureaucracy is the digitalization of administration. This can eliminate many administrative procedures, automate data exchange and make it easier to submit applications.
Administrative services should be digitally as far as possible. The status of
procedures should be accessible online. Through stronger networking between European and national authorities, the once-only principle is to be introduced so that in future data will only be requested once from companies so that it can then be exchanged within the framework of data protection regulations and within the authorities. We want to largely abolish the written form requirement in administrative procedures.
6. 
Digital sovereignty
Making Europe digitally fit
Digitalization provides a key to the central challenges of our time. It makes it possible to completely rethink fundamental areas of life such as transportation, education, health and energy. As a result, it offers enormous opportunities for economic development and for simplifying many tasks for everyone - from tedious administrative processes and the management of supply chains in industry to the research and treatment of serious diseases. We want to make it the foundation of a fair, decentralized, highly networked and resilient economic system.
We are also experiencing systemic competition in the digital sector - between emancipatory digitalization that empowers citizens and strengthens freedom, and digitalization that disempowers citizens and promotes surveillance for economic or political interests. Europe must consciously position itself in this competition and take a big step towards being an attractive location for talent and innovative companies and thus help shape the rapid digital development. We therefore want to secure, strengthen and expand Europe's digital sovereignty.
The basis of European digital sovereignty is, among other things, a resilient and climate- friendly infrastructure, which includes broadband networks, mobile networks, hubs, data centers and the reliability of sensitive supply chains. We want to drive forward the development and production of infrastructure components in Europe, be it the production and development semiconductors, satellite communications and mobile communications technology. We want to shape the connection to the global network infrastructure, whether for submarine cables or nodes, with strong European players.
Digital sovereignty means the development and application of key technologies such as AI, quantum computing and communication in Europe.
Here, too, we can rely on strong European companies in various sectors and strengthen this development with a bundling o f measures - for example, targeted investments as part of the investment program for innovation, sovereignty and resilience.
Wherever possible, we advocate the preference for free and open source software.
software and open data solutions. For critical infrastructures in particular, the European Commission must work together with the Member States to ensure that European standards for
IT security without backdoors and innovative digital offerings "made in the EU", such as software for controlling energy and water supplies, rail infrastructure or health information systems.
Advancing digitalization also means taking it into account in political projects. We want to consider the digital implementation of proposed legislation as early as the legislative process. This will enable government services to be provided faster and more efficiently. Above all, the digitalization of administrative processes can help to make political rules - from the CBAM border adjustment mechanism to data protection - manageable in economic practice.
Shaping artificial intelligence in Europe
Progress in the development and application of AI represents a huge opportunity for many areas of life. It can serve people, simplify our lives and make our lives easier.
It can change and simplify processes in everyday life, education and science, administration and business. Modern AI-supported processes can help to reduce the use of water and pesticides and increase crop yields at the same time. They protect the environment and increase economic efficiency.
At the same time, new risks are emerging due to the rapid progress of AI. These range from large- scale cyberattacks through AI-supported vulnerability scans to the structural
discrimination of social groups to risks such as incorrect situation assessments in autonomous driving. We want to use AI in accordance with our shared values to ensure effective protection of human rights and equality. We therefore support research and technology impact assessment to accompany the introduction of this technology and advocate regulation not only at European but also at global level. We support the approach of regulating AI applications with regard to their potential risk and, where necessary, making the underlying source data transparent.
With the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, the EU is taking a major step in this direction, which is being noticed and closely monitored worldwide. We want to shape and harness the potential of AI. In addition to the availability of computing capacity, we also need support for specialists, better availability of data and support for research and transfer.
In addition to the international establishment of eco- logical IT standards, we want to develop and implement sustainability standards for software designs andoperate energy-intensive data centers in a climate-neutral manner in the future. Sustai- nability by design must be the rule for software and networked devices; the EU must develop sustainability standards for AI, cloud platforms, browsers, search engines, digital marketplaces and social networks. We are calling for a Digital Sustainability Act at EU level in order to focus the innovative strength of companies in information technologies more strongly on sustainability. We also want to integrate a waste heat infrastructure for data centers into the European energy infrastructure.
Use data based on rights
Data and the processing of large data sets are the basis for numerous innovative technologies and AI in particular. The smart use of data makes an important contribution to enriching our lives together and tackling numerous social problems
as well as social and ecological innovations, to conserve resources and to advance scientific research.
We want Europe to take a decisive step forward in the availability of data, as this is critical for our competitiveness.
are. This applies to the development of AI, the success of European AI models and our ability to innovate as a whole. To this end, we want to make non-personal data more usable and more easily accessible based on rights. To facilitate access to personal data, we are examining procedures for anonymization, pseudonymization and the possibilities of synthetic data gen- eration. We have contributed to the implementation of this principle in legislation on t h e use and improved exchange of data between companies as part of the data strategy. We are therefore committed to ensuring that the public administration publishes its data in machine-readable formats. Projects such as Smart City Barcelona can serve as an example of how data can be made available and how research and innovation can be driven forward.
With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has strongly shaped data protection worldwide in recent years and set global standards in the regulation of personal data protection.
However, enforcement of the rules in the member states varies. While Germany needs less bureaucracy and more legal certainty, the rules for international digital companies based in other member states must be enforced just as consistently. Due to lax enforcement in recent years, big tech companies in particular have been able to gain competitive advantages that are crucial for all sectors of the economy, especially in the areas of advertising, social networks and AI. The European Commission must therefore ensure that the GDPR is enforced uniformly and consistently in order to effectively protect fundamental rights and citizens' rights and create a level playing field for all companies that use a
Exclude special treatment of large corporations compared to SMEs. We want to use the upcoming evaluation of the GDPR to simplify the regulations and make them more practicable while maintaining the same level of data protection, also to take into account the special needs of SMEs and start-ups.
We see further potential to support users in enforcing their claims, simplify implementation for SMEs and create all-round legal certainty through the digitalization of data protection agreements and an automated information option for collected personal data. In this way, we give users more transparency and control over the processing of their personal data. In addition, the approach makes it easier for citizens to donate their data for research purposes and thus create the data pools required for AI models.
Setting digital standards
Trust and reliability are the be-all and end-all of successful digitalization for consumers and companies. This trust is promoted and guaranteed by common standards. We therefore advocate fair, open and resilient digital regulatory frameworks.
We pay particular attention to the necessary investment security for European companies, especially SMEs. Because only clear and reliable rules ensure innovative, trustworthy and therefore successful economic spaces. With the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we have taken important steps towards this in the EU. The completion of the digital single market can help Europe to be globally competitive.
A key to successful digital policy lies in interoperability: Europe's digital systems must speak the same language.
Interoperability refers to the ability of
IT systems to handle business processes across the boundaries of companies, authorities and research institutions - fully automatically,
without manual input or media disruptions. This requires the standardization of common software interfaces, specific to each use case. In this way, individuals, companies, research institutions and NGOs can carry out transactions with each other equally.
Experience shows that standardization can help innovative technologies achieve a breakthrough. Examples of this are the World Wide Web and digital mobile communications (GSM).
Interoperability breaks through monopolies, opening up economic areas and markets worth billions, which offer huge opportunities, especially for SMEs from Europe.
With the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), the EU has created an initial crystallization point that we are using as a starting point: In various groups, representatives of different interest groups are developing the standardized IT interfaces (profiles) for the respective application.
The development of these standards must be democratically legitimized. Arbitrary consortia of large international companies lack this. We therefore want to open up standardization to developers, civil society and SMEs. Their commitment must be remunerated so that everyone can participate in this design under the same conditions. We see it as a central task of the EU to monitor this democratic governance and ensure planning and investment security. These standards should be freely available and usable without license fees. The EU can also make a decisive contribution to enforcing these standards on the market through the power of the public sector as a customer.
Digitize consumer protection
Disinformation and hate are taking up more and more space in digital media and endangering social coexistence. The increasing relevance of software and digital platforms in society and our democracy must be reflected in consumer protection. Over the past few years, the EU has made significant progress in this area.
Progress has been made. With the DSA and the DMA, we in Europe have laid the foundations for creating clear rules on the internet and restoring competition. Big tech companies must now regularly assess the risk that their algorithms pose to society - and propose countermeasures where necessary. Under our pressure, scientists and NGOs will be given access to the platforms' data in order to research their effects and make them public. The advertising and tracking-based business models, whose algorithms prefer to show emotionalizing content in order to bind users to the respective platform, must also be put to the test.
The task now is to consistently enforce the DSA and the DMA in Germany and Europe and to further develop them based on the knowledge gained through data access. Laws to protect consumers in the digital space must be enforced and applied; to this end, we want to strengthen consumer protection agencies at national and European level. The regulation of digital platforms must take a closer look at the dominance of large digital marketplaces. In this context, fundamental rights are increasingly being violated on these platforms when users are blocked for no reason.
In addition to the rules of digital consumer protection, digital education is also an important building block to guarantee the rights and participation of all citizens in the digital social debate and to strengthen their information literacy.
We want to ensure fair competitive conditions that offer SMEs good access and do not expose consumers to unlimited market power. It must be ensured that SMEs can trade their products online under fair conditions. To this end, we will tighten up competition law if necessary. Digital business models must be sparing in their use of personal data. We want to strengthen the rights of users on digital communication platforms. Interoperability helps here:
Platforms should be able to communicate with each other so that users of different services can interact with each other. This will enable and improve the transfer of data so that users can access it when they leave platforms.
7. Circular economy
Reducing resource consumption and dependence on raw materials
The consumption and waste of resources contribute to the ecological and social crises of our time. We will therefore also campaign at European and international level for binding resource protection targets in order to reduce the absolute consumption of resources so that our economy comes into line with planning limits.
We need raw materials for a climate-neutral economy, the necessary technologies and products, because they are in the e-car on the road or the solar panel on the roof. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the demand for metallic raw materials for green energy technologies alone will quadruple by 2040 inordertomeet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. A large proportion of these raw materials are currently mined in countries of the Global South - and processed in smelters and refineries in the People's Republic of China.
German and European companies are dependent on imports for 75 to 100 percent of a number of metals. With China currently occupying the central position in the raw material supply chain, Europe must diversify its raw material sources in order to secure its own independence. A particular
The provision of high-quality secondary materials plays a particularly important role here. We therefore advocate the establishment of a European raw materials agency as well as regular and mandatory stress tests for affected companies in order to ensure the security of raw materials for the European economy.
With the EU Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA), we have taken a major step towards greater raw material security. The aim of the CRMA is that no more than 65 percent of imports of critical raw materials may come from a single third country.
Our diversification approach is based on various pillars: the reduction of raw material consumption and the implementation of an effective circular economy, the substitution of particularly scarce raw materials, the use and further processing of domestic raw materials in the EU and the implementation of a sustainable foreign policy on raw materials, which focuses on the expansion of partnerships with countries worldwide and pursues ambitious sustainability goals. For greater raw material security and environmental protection, we want to implement outstanding legislative proposals from the Green Deal and the action plan for a circular economy in a timely manner - while adhering to the waste hierarchy. In doing so, we are focusing on ambitious avoidance, reuse and recycling targets as well as more eco- design instead of downcycling.
Circular economy
The smart use of resources is one of the key prerequisites for a competitive economy. The circular economy has arrived in the mainstream and we are making it a European model for success. The greatest contribution to raw material security is saving scarce raw materials and reusing them. The circular economy aims to ensure that materials and products are shared, leased, reused, repaired, refurbished and recycled for as long as possible.
and recycled and waste is reduced to a minimum. This starts with the design of new products. That is why we want to support resource-conserving, durable and environmentally friendly design in the sense of "Design for Reuse, Repair and Recycling". It is good that the Eco-design Directive is now being further developed in this sense. Consumer goods should meet stricter minimum criteria in orderto protect the climate and conserve resources.
Producers must consider the entire life cycle of their products so that not only production but also use and recycling are as sustainable as possible.
We
advocate a circular economy that prioritizes the preservation and renovation of existing buildings, promotes the reuse of building products and supports the expansion of digital building component exchanges. We focus on ecological and recycled building products, the digital building passport and a digital building material and component passport.
All too often, for example, a washing machine ends up in the bin because it is easier and cheaper to buy a new one than to have it repaired. This uses up resources unnecessarily and causes 35 million tons of waste from still usable goods in the EU every year. For a society without waste, we want to strengthen the right to repair, introduce an obligation to provide spare parts and minimize the destruction of new goods. Transparency and reliability for consumers through a durability and repair index for large household appliances, for example, and longer warranty periods can be key approaches here. This should also soon put an end to the destruction of returned goods from online retailers. In addition, we want to strengthen opportunities to rent and borrow products under socially just conditions.
We want to build on the EU textile strategy and achieve circular textile production with better durability, repairability, reusability and recyclability. To this end, we want to promote alternative business models such as repair, rental and sharing services for textiles.
We are still losing valuable raw materials for the production of goods due to incomplete
Rules. We want to put a stop to illegal waste exports by consistently implementing the new Waste Shipment Ordinance. We want to stop plastic pollution worldwide and are committed to ending plastic waste exports to third countries altogether. In the current negotiations on a global plastics agreement, the EU should advocate globally binding rules for sustainable product design and the promotion of plastic avoidance, reuse and recycling.
In order to increase security of supply in the EU, we need a European approach so that we can better coordinate the sources and processing of raw materials.
capacities on our continent effectively. This also includes the domestic mining of scarce raw materials and the strengthening of
processing capacities in the EU. We will work to ensure that the EU makes ambitious progress in this area in compliance with high sustainability and human rights standards.
We want to reduce the extraction of raw materials in opencast mining as much as possible.
However, sources of raw materials do not only exist underground: in our homes, infrastructures, but also in our landfills and dumps, there are sources of raw materials that we have not yet sufficiently tapped into. That is why we want to promote the consistent reuse and further utilization of raw materials through a circular economy that makes use of the opportunities offered by digital solutions and promotes urban mining. This will enable us to create new business models while reducing the need for scarce primary raw materials.
We want to introduce reusable and deposit systems throughout Europe and give them priority over single-use packaging. In order to achieve the national collection quotas for batteries, we want to create a Europe-wide deposit system for batteries. Reuse always has priority over recycling. The use of critical raw materials such as lithium should be replaced by less critical minerals, for example through the increased use of sodium-ion batteries. We want to provide further research funding for this.
Forming raw material partnerships
In order to diversify our sources of raw materials outside the EU, we are committed to a sustainable foreign raw materials policy. It aims to establish new and strategic partnerships in the raw materials sector and deepen existing partnerships. We support international cooperation formats such as the Mine- rals Security Partnership (MSP) and increased
G7 cooperation within the framework of the Critical Raw Materials Club.
In addition, we want to deepen partnerships with resource-rich countries around the world and thus support them in implementing and enforcing the UN Sustainable Development Goals and international human rights standards. We do not want to align cooperation offers unilaterally with European supply interests, but rather support partner countries in increasing their value creation in the raw materials sector. We want to work with them to build the green supply chains of the future and give the population a share in the profits from resource extraction. We want to support countries in this task via the Global Gateway and other financing initiatives and, in this context, also promote the expansion of transportation and energy infrastructure.
8. Modern mobility
Advancing Europe's transport transition
Everyone in Europe should have the opportunity to be mobile in a climate-friendly, barrier-free, safe and affordable way. We are committed to ensuring that climate-friendly mobility is also the most attractive in terms of price and affordable for everyone. This includes ensuring that people can move around comfortably even without their own car. To achieve this, we are modernizing the European rail network and making it the backbone of the infrastructure union. For a successful transport transition throughout Europe, we need modern, well- developed rail routes and attractive trains across borders, a dense network of cycle paths and cycle routes, barrier-free pedestrian traffic, the expansion of e-charging infrastructure, a safe road network, climate-friendly air and sea traffic and attractive offers to combine different modes of transport.
Integrated urban development and spatial
planning with the concept of short distances make a decisive contribution to this. With the instrument of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), we want to promote this in all major European cities. Innovative means of transportation and new
We want to support mobility solutions such as cable cars or autonomous local public transport.
Such a turnaround in transportation is a central building block for a good and self-determined life in harmony with climate protection - in the city and in the countryside. We are committed to the further development of the European rail network, also in order to promote climate-friendly tourism in Europe. To this end, the expansion of the Trans- European Transport Networks (TEN-T) rail network must be completed much faster and with a higher share of EU funding. The restoration of gaps between countries, European freight transport and good night trains are also a priority for us. We want to create further incentives for shifting freight to rail and inland waterways. For this we need
We are creating a standardized Europe-wide freight train network with fast loading terminals for combined transport, where loads can be transferred from trucks to trains. This will make the environmentally friendly transportation of goods more competitive, more reliable and cheaper. In the medium term, we want to expand the German cycle into a European cycle.
Night trains are a comfortable and climate-friendly way to travel long distances within Europe and are therefore a good alternative to flying. A massive expansion of barrier-free night train services is therefore necessary. We are therefore advocating reduced track access charges, better funding for cross-border trains, the rapid expansion of rail infrastructure and, in particular, an industrial policy offensive for modern sleeping cars.
Strengthening the rail and bicycle industry offers great employment potential
in development, production and maintenance. In particular, the industrial policy potential of the bicycle industry for local, resource-efficient production is far from exhausted. We are therefore advocating a European cycling strategy that also includes the construction of safe cycle paths and the promotion of the private and commercial use of cargo bikes.
Book tickets easily
What is a matter of course when booking flights should also be standard for all train journeys in Europe in future. With a cross-provider ticketing system, we can enable booking platforms to offer cross-border, end-to-end tickets including sharing offers as well as boarding and alighting assistance for everyone. The cheapest tickets will be made easily accessible. Travelers will receive clear and transparent information on costs, travel times, accessibility and the climate impact of each travel option and will be able to choose the best option for them. To bring Europe closer together by rail, bookings must be simplified.
This should also apply to the offline sale of tickets. It should be easier to reserve Interrail tickets. We want to invite people to travel with confidence and therefore strengthen passenger rights. For example, travelers should be able to use any next train or bus in the event of a train cancellation, even if it is operated by another company.
Consistent implementation of the open data principle with open interfaces in public transport should also ensure that mobility services can be used easily and cheaply by everyone throughout Europe. In particular, sharing models and the combination of different means of transport, for example e-bike and train or park and ride, should benefit from this. In order to promote climate- friendly and barrier-free mobility, we want to enable passengers to take bicycles on new trains and ensure the right to transport necessary mobility aids free of charge.
We also want to strengthen the flat-rate principle in public transport in Europe, which we have successfully established in our own country with the Deutschland-Ticket. The Deutschland-Ticket should also be valid in the first state in the neighboring country in order to strengthen cross- border exchange. Flat-rate tickets with a similar principle should be mutually recognized. In this way, we are gradually achieving that
with a Europaticket you can use local transport in the
throughout the EU.
Implementing the drive turnaround
We want to design comprehensive offers for climate-neutral mobility: Attractive public transport enables a traffic turnaround and, in combination with integrated urban planning for shorter journeys, even a mobility turnaround. In this way, we make it possible for everyone to get around comfortably, even without their own car, with reliable and cost-effective services. And for the climate, at the heart of the mobility and transport transition is the drive transition, which ensures that things move in a climate-neutral and quiet way. The principle of operating as many means of transport as possible electrically with renewable energies must apply. We support the use of green hydrogen and the e-fuels based on it in shipping and air traffic. In road transport, however, we reject the use of e-fuels due to their lack of energy efficiency as well as their lack of climate and environmental friendliness. We only promote green hydrogen in road transport for heavy commercial vehicles.
As a key industry, the automotive industry provides many jobs. We want to support the industry - andin particular its employees - on the path to climate- neutral and resource-efficient mobility services. In a historic decision, the EU has decided that from 2035, no more fossil combustion engines may be newly registered in passenger cars. By 2030, emissions from new passenger cars are also to be reduced by 55 percent compared to 2021.
The CO2 reduction of passenger car drives by 2035 is to be pursued consistently and even more ambitiously than before. This is good for the
Germany as a business location, climate protection and consumers. Now we want to ensure that it is just as easy to drive an e-car to the nearest train station as it is to go on a family vacation. We have laid the foundation for a nationwide, intelligently networked and efficient charging infrastructure for all means of transport with the reform of the Alternative Fuels Ordinance: Over the next few years
sufficient charging points for cars and trucks set up on long-distance roads and in rural areas. Charging points must display their prices transparently.
Customers must be able to pay simply, transparently and without excessive roaming charges.
We also want to create incentives for e-vehicles to make them lighter and even more energy-efficient.
The proportion of freight traffic that remains on the road will in future be largely battery-electric. This requires the rapid expansion of the charging infrastructure for trucks along Europe's long- distance roads, in depots and freight distribution centers. We have successfully campaigned for this and will continue to do so. At the same time, the networks need to be efficiently upgraded to make them fit for the future.
New cars and other means of transport should be more closely aligned with the circular economy through efficiency standards right from the manufacturing and development stages.
and general energy and resource efficiency. We want to create greater incentives for manufacturers to offer lighter and more efficient solutions and reduce emissions, for example through tire and brake wear. By providing consumer-friendly information on the weight and carbon footprint of vehicles, we are ensuring greater transparency and making purchasing decisions easier.
In order to make heavy air and shipping traffic climate-neutral, we are supporting the production of sustainable fuels from renewable energies, for example e-kerosene, promoting fuel-saving technologies and the rapid development of a climate-neutral energy supply in ports, in particular a climate-neutral shore-side electricity supply. This will make fossil and biogenic fuels in transport a thing of the past in a generation. We are developing a European port strategy that ensures fair competitive conditions between European ports and strengthens the resilience of the European maritime location, also in the face of foreign investors who are looking to acquire and otherwise control the European maritime infrastructure. The port strategy optimizes the
investment needs, strengthens our continent in global supply chains and protects against too much influence from authoritarian states. We need
They are also needed to prevent further ecological damage caused by competition between locations for ever deeper shipping channels. We promote rail and inland waterway transport to ensure good hinterland connections. By including shipping in EU emissions trading, we are achieving a binding reduction in emissions.
We support the research and development of climate-neutral technologies for air travel. Shifting air traffic to more climate-friendly alternatives - especially for short-haul flights - remains our goal. We are calling for the EU-wide introduction of an air traffic tax based on energy content, similar to the one already levied in Germany. The majority of the resulting revenue should go to the EU budget. This should not put European airlines at a disadvantage compared to their international competitors.
Making traffic safe
We are pursuing Vision Zero for road traffic. Our goal is to ensure that there are no more traffic accidents with fatalities and serious injuries. We are committed to a safe transport infrastructure for everyone, especially children and the elderly. Municipal decision-making sovereignty over
Our goal remains a 30 km/h speed limit in urban areas and an EU-wide speed limit on major roads. We want to continue to promote the voluntary retrofitting of turning assistance systems in trucks in ordertoachieve the fullest possible coverage as quickly as possible.
Noise is still underestimated as a health factor. We are committed to more ambitious reduction targets for traffic. We want to make airplanes, trains, cars and motorcycles more responsible for people's health. To this end, we want to further develop the EU Environmental Noise Directive and source- related noise directives (e.g. limit values for vehicle noise emissions) and adapt them to the state of the art. Multiple pollution
We want to take greater account of this. In this way, the impact of traffic on people's health can be reduced by up to 50 percent. Nitrogen oxide, (ultra) fine dust, tire and brake abrasion must also be minimized to protect health. The Clean Air Directive and the
Euro 7 emissions standard are important steps in this direction. We are also striving to harmonize the European rules for environmental zones.
In lower airspace, new forms of mobility must be measured against the benefits they bring to society. We therefore advocate for regulations that only permit these in harmony with the protection of people, nature and the environment and under high safety requirements. We want to strengthen the right of local authorities to actively participate in the planning and design of airspace for drone operations over their territory.
9. Intact nature
Preserving our nature
We are part of nature. Our prosperity, our quality of life, our future and our survival depend on it.
Protecting nature and ensuring that we can continue to use it responsibly and respectfully in the future is a crucial political task. The
This is not least because the wealth of European habitats - from the almost untouched forests of northern and south-eastern Europe to the countless lakes and diverse cultural landscapes of Central Europe and the Mediterranean - shapes our self-image as Europeans and stands for our continent worldwide.
Thanks to our efforts in Germany and Europe, we have achieved major breakthroughs here in recent months:
The EU Nature Restoration Law (NRL), the agreements reached at the World Conference on Nature in Montreal in 2022 and the UN agreement on the protection of biodiversity on the high seas are historic milestones.
ne. Thanks to these agreements, 30 percent of land and sea areas are to be under nature conservation, 10 percent of the areas even under special protection. The task now is to fully implement the agreed targets and restoration plans, as well as the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and to set binding interim targets and measures. We therefore advocate the creation of a network of well-monitored and effective protected areas on land and at sea, including zero-use zones.
Endangered species and habitats should finally be better protected and damaged ecosystems restored.
Binding rules for the protection of the high seas were also agreed for the first time. Overall, marine resources may now only be used sustainably. With the NRL, we in the European Parliament have set our continent o n course for the urgently needed restoration of European nature. We must now put these plans into practice: Significantly improved nature conservation funding and a reorientation of agricultural and fisheries subsidies towards ecological use are essential for achieving global and European goals. That is why we are calling for a dedicated nature conservation fund in the EU budget. We want to finance the restoration of nature by comprehensively reducing environmentally harmful subsidies. The NRL aims to put all ecosystems on the road to recovery by 2050. We are working towards rapid and complete implementation of the targets and interim targets. When intervening in nature, unjustifiable risks such as the endangerment or even extinction of entire populations or species through genetic engineering methods must be ruled out.
We also want to strengthen the legal framework in environmental law. In order to prosecute environmental crimes, we support the reform of the EU Environmental Criminal Law Directive and the outlawing of the most serious environmental crimes as part of the amendment to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. At the same time, we are working in Germany and the EU to prevent further sealing of agricultural, forest and natural areas.
and consistently - with the aim of achieving a circular economy.
Saving biodiversity
Alongside the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis - the rapid extinction of species - is the second global crisis affecting our livelihoods and our
Health threatened. Both crises are interdependent. Essential ecosystem services such as pollination, soil fertility, erosion control, water and carbon storage as well as the recreational function are under threat. At the same time, intact nature is our most important ally in the fight against the climate crisis. Nature conservation and climate protection must therefore be considered together. This is why we combine the faster implementation of climate protection measures and the expansion of renewable energies with compliance with the highest ecological protection standards, in particular the European Flora-Fauna-Habitat and Birds Directives.
In order to tackle the climate and biodiversity crisis together, we particularly want to promote natural climate protection. The key elements here are the rewetting of moors and floodplains, the preservation and renaturation of species-rich grassland, near-natural forest conversion, which also protects animals and plants, and effective marine protection.
We are committed to ensuring that there will be no deep-sea mining until there is sufficient scientific knowledge about its effects and serious environmental damage can be ruled out. After all, alongside peatlands and forests, the oceans are among the most important allies in the fight against the climate and biodiversity crisis.
Intact ecosystems can only exist with a vibrant diversity of species. Of the 8 million animal and plant species on our planet, 1 million are threatened with extinction - and thus an infinite wealth. This mass extinction must be stopped as a matter of urgency. An important lever for this is the way in which we cultivate land. We want to stop the loss of species in and around agricultural land and forests by reducing the use of land.
and strengthen nature conservation in the management of land. The preservation of ecosystems and the protection of key species in particular, which are essential for the functioning of biotic communities, must therefore always be given high priority.
become. We want to promote organic farming and near-natural forest management. This protects our soils as well as animals and plants and increases biodiversity. Europe's forests are severely threatened by the consequences of the ongoing climate crisis. We are committed to moving away from monocultural management, significantly reducing the use of pesticides and promoting a near-natural transformation, primarily based on natural regeneration. The valuable old-growth forests
in Europe and make 10% of the EU's forests available for natural development. Illegal deforestation and clear-cutting must be stopped. Instead, reforestation should be specifically promoted. This requires uniform minimum ecological standards for forestry throughout Europe. Natural wood is
a versatile raw material for construction and housing that is too valuable to burn in large power plants. In view of the increasing drought and heat, we also need a European forest fire strategy that reduces the risk of fire through comprehensive preventive measures, near-natural forests, the avoidance of clear-cutting and ecological protection corridors.
We want to reconnect natural habitats to preserve biodiversity. The aim is to create a sustainable green infrastructure for Europe's nature. We want to restore the Natura 2000 network to a good conservation status and link it with corridors that strengthen exchange. This is because intact habitats and genetic diversity promote the resilience of our ecosystems and thus also create added value for society. The corridors should be created in close cooperation with local authorities, farmers, forest owners and foresters. Financial incentives for farmers and landowners should serve the goal of introducing sustainable practices that promote the protection of nature and the preservation of biodiversity. Measures for ecological land use such as
Multifunctional agroforestry systems or the creation of hedges at the edge of fields can be important tools for creating a network of biotopes and new habitats. In this context, we want to restore climate-resilient ecosystems and create alternative protection areas for cold-loving species as well as aid programs for particularly affected species.
We want to advance the Montreal Convention on Biological Diversity through a global implementation mechanism with concrete instruments. The aim is to effectively protect nature on 30 percent of the earth's surface and to restore 30 percent of the area already in use. To this end, the financial resources pledged by the EU must be used quickly, effectively and in a partner- oriented manner. Global biodiversity partnerships should enable comprehensive cooperation for the protection of ecosystems and the restoration of nature
- also together with civil society and municipal actors.
Protect the environment
Alongside the climate and biodiversity crisis, increasing pollution and littering is the third major challenge for the protection of our natural resources. It puts a strain on ecosystems and our health. Environmental pollution from chemicals and plastic waste plays a central role here. We want to ensure that the planetary boundaries are observed here too. It is particularly urgent to focus on substances that cause lasting damage to humans and ecosystems. These include so-called perpetual chemicals such as perfluorinated and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFAS). These have been widely used for decades, for example in the production of semiconductors, medical products, textiles and refrigerants. Wherever they can be easily replaced, and especially in consumer products, we want to phase out their use quickly.
At the same time, we need a differentiated
regulatory framework to strengthen the development of alternatives and accelerate the production ramp-up of important future technologies.
gies such as electrolyzers or electric drives
not to jeopardize the health of our employees. Among other things through proper
We want to continue to ensure the production of important future technologies with the right transitional periods, but at the same time accelerate the replacement of PFAS in these areas through a research offensive and strengthen the research and development of non-toxic production methods. In doing so, we will be guided by the latest scientific findings.
We are also committed to a chemicals strategy that truly implements sustainability requirements, especially for toys, food contact materials and cosmetics. We therefore want to make faster progress with the reform of the European instrument for the safety of chemicals (REACH regulation). We advocate the use of a more comprehensive approach to risk assessment that takes into account different dimensions of the impact of chemicals, faster procedures and better sanctioning options. Effective strategies are also needed,
halve the environmentally harmful effects of chemicals by 2030 in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity. In order to better protect important environmental assets, we want to improve the Environmental Liability Directive and implement the polluter pays principle.
In the EU, we advocate ambitious international agreements and cooperation to curb global pollution and environmentally harmful practices. Our aim is to establish an international chemicals law within the framework of the circular economy that takes risks into account in accordance with the precautionary principle and regulates the production of demonstrably harmful substances.
We reject the export of pesticides banned in the EU to other countries. Above all, however, we want to make our chemical industry sustainable and thus fit for the future. That is why we are advocating a new investment program for safe and sustainable chemicals "made in EU" (EU Sustainable Chemistry Act) to promote the market ramp-up of green chemistry. This is part of our program for a climate- friendly industrial policy.
Clean water for all
As the climate crisis progresses, extreme droughts and heavy rainfall events are also increasing significantly in Europe. Germany, for example, has lost 20 percent of its water reserves over the past 20 years. Regionally, this has had catastrophic consequences in some cases. We therefore need a European water strategy that buffers extremes, ensures clean drinking water for all and meets the needs of agriculture and natural habitats. We need landscapes, villages and cities that store water in the ground to get us through the hot and dry summers.
to bring. Clean water for all is a basic right. We are reducing water consumption by promoting climate-adapted land management, protecting wetlands, renaturalizing water bodies, rewetting moors and wanting to allow more and more rivers to flow freely again. We also maintain clean water by reducing the pollutant load in water, for example from mercury or PFAS, and by further strengthening the polluter pays principle for the
discharge of pollutants and wastewater treatment. In addition to the Nature Restoration Act, the objectives of the Water Framework Directive must also be implemented in the current decade in order toachieve good quality rivers and lakes throughout Europe and prevent the overexploitation of groundwater and the resulting threat of damage to wetlands and rivers.
In order to cope with the consequences of the climate crisis, we want to increase funding for the EU's climate adaptation strategy, including a European heat action plan for cross-sectoral measures, from warning levels to infra-structural adaptations. The expansion of European civil protection is necessary in order to cope with the increasing number of extreme events.
We are committed to the conversion to a climate- resilient water infrastructure and nature-friendly flood protection. We are reducing the risk of flooding caused by heavy rainfall events by giving streams and rivers more space again through an unsealing offensive and more rainwater storage. In the
In rural regions, we support the agricultural sector in creating its own water reserves by developing sponge farms in which water is stored as a reserve for times of drought, to replenish groundwater and for other uses such as paludiculture, fish farming and as recreational water. In the cities, green spaces, trees and green roofs help. The conversion to a sponge city also provides cooling, improves air quality and increases biodiversity. In this way, we can better prepare our cities for the consequences of the climate crisis.
We need Europe-wide cooperation, clear limits and rules to ensure that transnational water crises such as the one on the Oder are prevented in the future. We are committed to the goal of restoring 25,000 kilometers of free-flowing rivers in the EU - as envisaged in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. We want to prevent the planned expansion of the Oder for transport purposes in cooperation with the riparian states, as this endangers one of the last natural and free-flowing rivers in Europe. We advocate a binding priority for drinking water over commercial or agricultural use. Water belongs to everyone and is not an object of speculation. We therefore reject the privatization of the water supply.
We will focus on the economical use and storage of water in the landscape and strengthen this through rules and incentives, whether in arable farming through drought-tolerant crops or humus build-up, in vegetable growing through drip irrigation, in forests through near-natural, hardwood-oriented mixed forests or in trade and industry through more economical processes, closed water cycles, limited water withdrawal, cascade use and recycling. We are increasingly focusing on cooperation within Europe and with the countries bordering the Mediterranean.
After all, the experience gained in the arid regions of the south is urgently needed in other parts of Europe.
Protect animals
We also consistently take sides with animals. Society has a special responsibility for animals in human care. We want the EU to protect all animals through consistent and ambitious legislation and the enforcement of existing regulations. Because Europeans want animal welfare: six of the ten successful citizens' initiatives in the EU are committed to this.
We are following this wish and are campaigning for animal welfare as an EU common goal, explicit political responsibility for animal welfare in the EU Commission and EU funding for animal welfare.
We call for the implementation of the "Fur Free Europe" initiative to ban fur farming and the trade in farmed fur products on the European market.
Building on this, we are committed to the consistent implementation of the EU action plan to combat illegal species trade. International species protection agreements, in particular CITES and all its annexes, must be consistently implemented in the EU. We want to effectively prevent the commercial wildlife trade. Targeted research and species protection programs by scientific institutions and experts on non- commercial wildlife trade should be implemented.
The import and trade of illegally exported specimens should be made punishable. The import and trade of specimens illegally exported from their country of origin should be made a punishable offense. We are in favor of a ban on the import of hunting trophies from animal species protected by the Washington Convention and the EU Endangered Species Regulation, as already called for by the EU Parliament. We want to relieve the burden on animal shelters by, among other things, labeling and registering dogs and cats as well as a positive list for the trade and keeping of exotic animals. We advocate high animal welfare standards in trade agreements.
We want to put an end to the import of animal products for which conditions have not been verified in accordance with EU animal welfare standards. We want to make animal welfare a goal of sustainable development.
The EU and member states should draw up concrete plans for phasing out animal testing that consistently end experiments on animals for cosmetics and wherever possible for chemical testing and medical products. The number of animal experiments for drug development and basic research should be reduced. Animal-free education and training initiatives should be promoted. We want to strengthen and accelerate the development, recognition and broad application of animal-free methods in practice.
Once recognized, they should be immediately included in test guidelines and replace animal testing. Whereitis not yet possible to completely dispense with animal testing, they must be implemented as gently as possible for the animals. The standards applicable in the EU should also apply to imports from other parts of the world.
10. A strong agriculture
Reorganizing the common agricultural policy
Farmers provide us in Europe with a variety of valuable foods. At the same time, agriculture shapes our cultural landscapes, the fields, meadows and vineyards that characterize Europe. We want to strengthen an agriculture that works in harmony with nature, in the service of all people, producers and consumers alike.
We are therefore striving for a fundamental reform of EU agricultural policy that consistently rewards services for the common good - in particular measures for the climate, water, soil, biodiversity, health and animal welfare - rather than land ownership. This r e q u i r e s clear regulations and incentives for the reduction of pesticide use, fertilization and livestock numbers as well as for crop rotation, the cultivation of protein crops and extensive grassland farming. business.	The	funding	should	be	low	in bureaucracy, enable planning security, have a sustainable impact and directly benefit those working on the ground.
farmers - especially smaller farms. A good approach is to use level and points systems that clearly focus on
The aim is to promote the common good, ecological measures and regenerative systems such as agroforestry systems, promote multi- annual measures and view farms as a system. Animal welfare promotion should be made mandatory by the Member States in their strategic plans. We want to create additional incentives for extensive grazing. Further developing organic farming should become the guiding principle of European agricultural policy. We call for a clear alignment with the objectives of the Farm to Fork Strategy and the NRL.
When promoting rural areas, we want to focus not only on the necessary infrastructure for a good life and social cohesion, but also on the (re)development of decentralized artisanal food processing, regional value chains, the diversification of agricultural businesses and the strengthening of producer groups. There is also new potential for more value creation in the energy sector - for example through
Agri-photovoltaics or by using agricultural machinery as electricity storage in the energy transition.
In view of the major ecological challenges in agriculture, we are also dependent on further innovation. Digitalization can help tomake agriculture more sustainable. For example, through GPS-controlled hoeing devices or in fertilization. This can save on fertilizers and pesticides. We want to protect the rights of farmers when it comes to the data they collect and access to the software of their machines ("right to repair").
We can thus shape EU agricultural policy in such a way that it offers prospects to all women and men working in agriculture, especially career changers and start-ups, because every farm counts. By creatingregional value chains from farm to fork - also digitally through product passports
and supply chain monitoring - and strengthen the food trade, we improve their economic framework conditions. In doing so, we are also promoting local food distribution channels.
Farmers must be strengthened vis-à-vis processors and retailers in the value chain. Retailers in particular can and must make a greater contribution to stabilizing revenues for producers and prices for consumers.
We are therefore campaigning for Europe-wide regulations to put an end to price dumping in the food sector.
Good food for everyone
Food is a central part of our culture and individual identity. Nutrition is crucial to our health and our quality of life. We want to make good nutrition possible for everyone. This is also a contribution to strengthening regional economic areas, as the production and processing of food locally creates well-being and regional identity.
Everyone should be able to decide for themselves what goes on their plate. The EU can protect consumers' freedom of choice by providing reliable information about the origin and content of food.
We are therefore advocating Europe-wide mandatory labels to support sustainable, regional and plant-based nutrition. We want to introduce mandatory labeling for animal husbandry in the European single market. On the other hand, misleading practices with private labels that advertise supposedly climate-neutral products, for example, should be put a stop to under the EU Green Claims Regulation.
We are setting the course for sustainability with an EU-wide framework for sustainable food systems. For example, we want to create incentives for better nutrition in communal catering, from daycare centers to hospitals, through changes to public procurement law. We want to create an environment in which it is easy to eat healthily and sustainably - along the lines of the planetary health approach.
- to eat. We want food to be free from chemical residues such as pesticides and hormones. By continuously increasing the proportion of organic food from regional production in communal catering, we are expanding reliable sales markets for organic farming. In this way, we are creating sustainable and healthy nutrition for everyone, especially children.
We want to increase the range of plant-based products, make them more easily accessible and change the EU's food-related funding programs to make them climate-friendly. This is also important for achieving climate and species protection goals. We are therefore improving the framework conditions for plant-based foods by promoting research and market launches, among other things. In order to better counter future crises, the EU needs a protein strategy with efficient approval procedures that increase the self-sufficiency rate for vegetables, nuts and plant-based and alternative proteins. We support the research and development of modern fermentation processes and cell cultivation to a new extent for the development of sustainable food and for Europe as a location for business and innovation.
We are in favor of agriculture that conserves resources and is environmentally friendly and is based on the principles of organic farming with its principles of animal welfare, freedom from genetic engineering and freedom from synthetic pesticides.
As with any technology, the political compass for dealing with both old and new genetic engineering methods must guarantee the freedom of research on the one hand and exclude risks to humans and the environment during application on the other. New genetic engineering methods in agriculture should also be researched with regard to their opportunities, risks and consequences. For sustainable and transparent agriculture
It is essential that companies that want to operate GMO-free can do so safely. A strict approval procedure and the precautionary principle enshrined in European law must be upheld. To this end, risk assessments on a comprehensive
We need a scientific basis and regulation that excludes uncontrollable spread and protects GMO- free production and consumers' freedom of choice through mandatory labeling. We reject patents on plants and animals. This will secure the future of small and medium-sized farms and breeding operations in particular.
Food belongs on the plate and not in the tank or even in the bin. We therefore advocate legally binding measures to halve food waste by 2030, including the reassessment of sorting characteristics and supermarket standards as well as the introduction of consumption dates instead of best-before dates to provide more binding information on the safe consumption of food.
Shaping agriculture ecologically
Europe's agriculture must become more sustainable in order to secure the food supply of the future. In times of climate crisis, droughts, fires, storms and heavy rainfall, resilient cultivation systems are becoming the focus of all agricultural policy measures. This includes improving soil fertility and health, binding more CO2 than we emit, cultivating a greater diversity of crops and varieties in the fields and limiting the use of pesticides and synthetic chemical fertilizers as much as possible. We are guided by the criteria of regionality, circular economy and agroecology as well as the guiding principle of organic farming.
Our goal is to achieve a 25% share of organic
f a r m i n g by 2030 and to increase this share by 2035.
and beyond. In Germany, organic farms generate a higher income per person than conventional farms. This shows that it is already financially worthwhile to invest in regional and sustainable farming methods. We want to strengthen the framework conditions for this.
This also includes the EU's research and funding policy. It needs at least 30 percent of the funds earmarked for agricultural research.
and rural development, for the further development and promotion of the greening of agriculture and innovative concepts for the organic value chain, as well as for organic breeding research. We want to improve the EU organic label and its application - for example in animal husbandry. Organic farms should no longer have to provide double evidence, but should be recognized as organic due to their environmental performance.
"green by definition" apply.
For sustainable and transparent agriculture, it is essential that farms that want to operate GMO- free can do so safely. The EU should guarantee that everyone knows what they are eating and where it was produced. Transparency and freedom of choice must be ensured, especially in the case of genetically modified feed and food. We reject patents on plants, regardless of whether they originate from conventional breeding or genetic engineering.
The heavy use of pesticides pollutes our natural environment in many ways. However, the European plans adopted to date to reduce pollutants have not yet been sufficiently implemented.
We want to change this and ensure that the EU's targets and approval procedures are revised on a scientific basis. We want to oblige the member states to take further effective measures, such as a pesticide levy. Despite the setback in the European Commission's decision to extend the approval of glyphosate, we are continuing to fight for a ban on glyphosate in the EU as quickly as possible.
We are closing legal loopholes that currently allow the use of fertility-damaging chemicals in fertilizers or microplastics in pesticides, for example. In the approval process for pesticides, the relevant authorities must become more independent of the applicant manufacturers and their claims.
Manufacturers must no longer be able to choose in which Member State the authorities examine their applications. In addition, risk assessments must be developed and taken into account for other endangered animal groups. To save time and capacity
To ensure that we gain a competitive edge, we are accelerating the approval process for substances for which it is clear at an early stage that they cannot be approved due to exclusion criteria. We are also committed t o t h e consistent implementation of the polluter pays principle so that companies that use pesticides in are liable for any damage caused, for example to groundwater or organic farming.
Securing food with sustainability
Agriculture is suffering particularly from the climate crisis with long droughts and sudden heavy rainfall. If we put an end to over- fertilization, reduce the use of fossil fertilizers and turn soils back into CO2 sinks, agriculture is a key part of natural climate protection. That is why we are committed to rewetting peatlands, building up humus in arable soils and building up wood mass in agroforestry systems - with stable income prospects for farmers. In this way, agriculture can make the necessary contribution to climate protection and climate adaptation.
The rewetting of peatlands can only be achieved together with farmers. It is important to us that value creation is maintained in the peatland regions. That is why we support farmers in the cultivation of rewetted peatlands (paludiculture) and also promote the production of raw materials for climate-friendly building and insulation materials as well as for the soil industry and the establishment of new value chains in rural areas. We want to promote the use of rewetted peatlands as part of the CAP and reduce climate- damaging subsidies. Peatlands are real climate protectors, as significantly more carbon is stored here than in arable soil.
Pasture farming with suckler cow husbandry is one of the most animal-friendly forms of husbandry and contributes to species conservation. This is another reason why we want to give it more support.
Agroforestry systems, in which areas that have been farmed or grazed are planted with trees and shrubs.
The combination of shrubbery and organic farming is feasible with both organic and conventional agriculture. They are important for climate protection, soil fertility, the water balance and biodiversity, and thus for the development of resilient ecosystems. The diversification of business sectors creates greater income security for farmers. To ensure that the many positive effects can be realized, we want to remove barriers, promote research into them and develop their broader application in practice.
The European seas and their fish stocks are in a poor state. We will therefore better protect the marine environment in order to give fish stocks and our fishermen a sustainable perspective. That is why we support the Commission's action plan for the conservation of fisheries resources and the protection of marine ecosystems and are committed to faster and full implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The planetary boundaries must also be respected in the use of the oceans. We promote alternatives to gillnet and trawl fishing and take action against environmentally harmful fishing methods and excessive inputs of fertilizers and pollutants.
Keeping animals well
We want to shape animal husbandry in such a way that it respects the needs of animals as living beings and can supply sustainably produced, valuable food. The aim is to achieve land-based animal husbandry as quickly as possible. We support farms in this process. We see natural grazing as an integral part of our diverse landscapes. Industrial livestock farming, on the other hand, causes great animal suffering and endangers essential livelihoods and human health: Zoonotic pathogens, multi-resistant germs, drinking water pollution, habitat destruction, loss of species, food waste in animal fattening and excessive greenhouse gas emissions - when we harm animals, we ultimately harm ourselves.
In future, the number of animals we keep in European agriculture must be based on the Paris Climate Protection Agreement. We therefore want to keep fewer animals, significantly improve their husbandry conditions and focus breeding more on animal health. We are therefore committed to the establishment, improvement and better control of uniform Europe-wide animal welfare standards for breeding, husbandry, transport, killing and trade. This includes the end of cage and crate farming as well as the lack of fire safety precautions.
Accordingly, the funding framework is to be geared towards land-based animal husbandry and special support is to be given to pasture and grassland- based husbandry. The aim is to give animals considerably more space and year-round access to the outside and to ensure that they no longer have to stand on fully slatted floors. We need a significant reduction in live animal transports, a limit on long-distance transports to a maximum of eight hours and an end to animal transports to third countries outside the Schengen area. This also strengthens local processing. When it comes to slaughter, we demand better controls and advocate better, mandatory stunning methods, including for fish, crabs, lobsters and squid. We also want to make it possible to slaughter at the farm of origin if a certificate of competence is available and a veterinarian is present. The killing of chicks should be banned throughout the EU.
Human and animal health is under massive threat from the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock farming. Currently, more antibiotics are administered to healthy animals than to sick people. We want to drastically reduce the use of antibiotics in order to prevent the development of multi-resistant germs, which pose one of the greatest threats to human health. This requires a switch to better forms of husbandry, an increase in animal health, the restriction of group treatment and priority treatment of sick individual animals.
Reserve antibiotics should be reserved for human medicine. In animal breeding, we want to put an end to artificial stimulation using hormones from horse blood.
 What protects justice 
Inflation with the rising cost of living, the pandemic, war and increasing weather extremes have presented many people across Europe with major challenges. Many have had to accept painful cuts due to the price increases. Many self- employed people and small businesses have lost their livelihoods. And skyrocketing living costs are causing acute, sometimes even existential hardship far into the middle of society.
At the same time, the crisis management of recent years has shown what is possible whenwe stand together - in Germany and Europe.
In these times of crisis, people are longing for stability and cohesion. Europe offers the answer. European unification has raised the standard of living of millions of people and brought more social security. We are convinced that, especially in times of crisis, people in Europe must be able to rely on a strong welfare state that provides effective protection against poverty and social exclusion.
The EU can offer a protective space that secures social rights across borders and for the entire breadth of society. At the same time, the EU can provide the economic framework conditions that enable fair prosperity. A prosperity that must reach those who create it - a prosperity for the many. By building the infrastructure for a climate-neutral economy across Europe, we generate added value and maintain and create good jobs for millions of people: Economic and social infrastructure go hand in hand and are interdependent.
The strong and fair Europe that we want to shape is essentially aimed at protecting each and every individual andrespecting the achievements of all. It protects the rights of workers against exploitation. It respects the dignity of
pensioners and the unemployed. It reduces inequality. It secures citizens' entitlement to effective medication and access to high-quality and inclusive healthcare. It ensures that consumers can assert their claims. It helps to ensure that families and the elderly are better protected, children have a good future and older people play an active role in society. It enables young people to gain new experiences.
Europe is more than just an economic area. The European Union is also a social union committed to social progress. Europe is characterizedbythe promise of a life in dignity and freedom, of good working and living conditions, of equal opportunities and a livelihood without poverty, exclusion or discrimination - a promise of justice to the breadth of society.
We are committed to ensuring that this promise is now kept everywhere. To this end, we want to further strengthen the social dimension of the EU. We want to improve the conditions so that all Europeans can live and work even more easily and securely anywhere in the Union. This will turn social security into more freedom.
To this end, we want a Europe that sets binding standards - for fair wages and strong trade unions, against arbitrariness and exploitation. This will ultimately benefit everyone in the EU, whether in prosperous or poorer regions. In this way, the social infrastructure complements the economic infrastructure; in this way, we fulfill the European aspiration of an infrastructure union for all; in this way, we create cohesion across the entire continent. Because clear minimum standards effectively prevent a race to the bottom in social security.
We stand for a strong social Europe that protects people from crises and provides a local
makes a real difference. When we talk about European sovereignty, we are also talking about shaping and defending a European social model that holds its own in a globalized world - and stands for prosperity and material security, good work and high social standards. This applies all the more as the challenge of climate neutrality, technological progress and demographic change are transforming the world of work.
The European Pillar of Social Rights sets out the principles for a social Europe.
It is an important milestone in a coordinated European social policy. But it must not stop at principles and recommendations. We want to derive legally binding and enforceable labor and social standards from it. Even if the welfare state is institutionally anchored primarily in the member states, social justice must not stop at national borders.
We want to build a fair Europe. The right Europe is a community that is financed on the basis of solidarity, without tax loopholes for the super-rich. A just Europe is a continent where everyone can live well - whether in the greater Milan area, in Lusatia or in rural Romania. A fair Europe offers access to fairly paid work and public services, good education and unspoiled nature.
In short, a just Europe is an area of opportunity and solidarity. It combats social exclusion and discrimination. It promotes social justice, equality for women, inclusion, cohesion between generations, families, protection of children's rights and respect for human rights.
This is how it is laid out in the founding process of the EU. We are fighting for this justice. We want to be this Europe.
1. 
Good work and social security
Achieving fair wages
Good work with fair and reliable working conditions and effective co-determination provides security and support, especially in times of economic upheaval. Too many people in Europe have suffered from noticeable real wage losses and rising living costs in recent years. Those who can live reliably from their work and actively shape their workplace can also get involved in changes.
This also strengthens democracy. We want to shape good standards throughout Europe and prevent precarious employment and exploitation. A strong social partnership and a wide range of collective agreements are important foundations for good work.
One concrete success of social Europe is the Minimum Wage Directive. It protects the value and dignity of work and helps to ensure that many millions of employees in Europe will have a higher income in future - as the German government has also demonstrated on our initiative with the significant increase in the statutory minimum wage. The directive obliges member states to set appropriate minimum wages according to clear criteria and to demonstrate that effective measures have been taken. We want the Minimum Wage Directive to be consistently implemented in Germany and the EU recommendation to link the minimum wage to 60 percent of the median wage to be made binding. This would significantly increase the statutory minimum wage in Germany and other member states and continue to provide effective minimum protection for employees in the future. In addition, the directive is intended to strengthen the binding nature of collective bargaining: Member States with collective bargaining coverage of less than 80 percent must submit an action plan. We will also implement this in Germany and thus strengthen fairness in the middle of society. Because in this country, the scope of collective agreements is
has fallen sharply in recent decades. Effective monitoring is needed to ensure that the minimum wage directive actually takes effect in all member states. In this way, Europe can take concrete action against dumping wages so that work always pays and security is guaranteed in retirement.
We want to expand democracy and co- determination in the workplace across all countries. To this end, we want to strengthen the European Works Councils by working alongside the trade unions to call on the EU Commission to finally revise the existing directive on European Works Councils and put an end to exemptions. We want to improve legal certainty, legal access and enforcement options for European works councils. In order to close loopholes, franchise companies should also be included in the directive. We are also committed to increasing the representation of women, young employees and trainees in European Works Councils. Secondly, we are committed to reviewing the Societas Europaea Participation Act (SEBG) with regard to the representation of employees on the Supervisory Board. In particular the
We are focusing on the "before and after
principle": When a company is converted into a European Company, the existing level of co- determination must no longer be frozen.
In order to strengthen employee participation throughout the EU, we are campaigning for a new framework directive on the information, consultation and participation of employees that is tailored to the various European forms of company.
We are also fighting f o r modern occupational health and safety in Europe - in a rapidly accelerating digital working world, which for many employees is associated with constant availability, work intensification and stress. We therefore want to
a d v a n c e the protection of employees from mental and physical stress. In this way, we also strengthen the self-determination and potential of older employees. We are also committed to the comprehensive participation of people with disabilities and an i n c l u s i v e labor market.
Across Europe, too many people are still involuntarily out of work. To stabilize the labour market and the economy, we are strengthening the right to work through government support and investment. In the regions undergoing structural change in particular, we are committed to ensuring that employees within the region have the same level of subsequent employment. The transformation of these regions will only succeed with reliable offers for further training and placement.
Empowering employees in the digital world of work
New technologies offer great opportunities: new business areas and models create new jobs, digitalized processes bring productivity gains and work becomes more flexible, for example through home office arrangements. This change must not have a detrimental effect on women's participation in the world of work. Exploitation must not be a business model in the digital world of work either. That is why we are committed to strong rights for employees in the digital age. Collaboration in the digital labor market, for example in content moderation, should not reinforce colonial continuities.
Across the EU, around 28 million people work for companies that offer and combine digital services, known as platform companies. These companies benefit from the bogus self-employment model, which is widespread in the EU. The EU Commission estimates that 4 million workers in platform companies are bogus self-employed. In the ongoing European legislation on working conditions on digital platforms, we are committed to putting a stop to bogus self-employment, which leads to poor working conditions and inadequate social protection, across Europe. Fair working conditions should also apply in the gig economy.
We also need better ways of enforcing the rules. To this end, we want to strengthen labor inspections, among other things.
Many companies use software to automatically assign tasks and organize work.
The aim is to end the constant monitoring, loss of personal planning security in everyday life and the excessive work pressure that can accompany its use. We want to put an end to the constant monitoring, the loss of personal planning security in everyday life and the excessive work pressure that can accompany its use. In order to strengthen workers' rights and prevent abuse, we are campaigning for a new EU directive on algorithmic management in the workplace.the advances in the development of artificial intelligence offer great potential for workers. We want to use this to create good jobs and fair working conditions, as assistance systems can reduce the workload. The broad participation of the workforce is a key factor for the acceptance and successful introduction of such systems. We take into account employees' concerns about job losses. We are committed to ensuring that companies offer their employees the opportunity to prepare for this development through training and further education at an early stage. This gives them security and the opportunity to help shape change.
Making freedom of movement easier
The fact that EU citizens can work and live in any member state is a fundamental principle of the EU. This opens up enormous freedoms and promotes equal opportunities for everyone in the EU. At times, it also presents workers with new challenges for which European answers must be found. To ensure that the model of cross-border living and working works for employees in everyday life, we are committed to better coordination of national social security systems.
It is a great achievement that EU citizens can take social security entitlements that they have acquired in another EU country with them across borders (portability). However, the reality does not always live up to this promise: The differences between national social security systems, as well as the bureaucracy, make handling complicated, and gaps in benefits are not always filled.
benefits leave some behind. We therefore want more coordination between the national social insurance systems to make it easier to transfer social benefit entitlements from one country to another and to reduce the existing gaps, especially for cross-border commuters. We want to achieve this by ensuring the unbureaucratic exchange of information between the relevant social security systems and using the advantages of digitalization to do so.
Long-term care, for example for the elderly or people with chronic illnesses or disabilities, should also be covered in this way. A European Social Security Passport (ESSPASS) is a contribution to this. It should improve the transferability of entitlements across borders and reduce bureaucracy through digital verification. We also want to replace the so- called A1 certificate with a digital real-time register in order to prevent cross-border labor exploitation and ensure effective social protection.
Working from home was part of everyday life for many employees during the corona crisis and has been appreciated by more and more employees since then. We support these developments where it is practicable to do so. We also want mobile working not to stop at European borders, but to be possible in principle from a country other than the country of employment. We are therefore committed to ensuring that there is a guideline for working from home that makes it easier to work from home throughout the EU.
Fighting exploitation
For freedom of movement to work for all workers, effective protection against exploitation is also essential. Regardless of whether a worker from Austria is working in France or a seasonal worker from Georgia in Romania: EU citizens and people from third countries need comprehensive protection against discrimination and exploitation when they work in another EU country.
This is clearly demonstrated by the scandals in the meat industry, 24-hour care, truck drivers, seasonal workers and the construction industry. We are declaring war on these forms of exploitation.
Workers in these sectors often live and work in more than one place in the EU. They therefore make a substantial contribution to a functioning internal market and to maintaining our social systems, but are exposed to additional risks. We want to use European levers to combat bogus self- employment and wage and social dumping in these areas.
Regular labor inspections can also be an effective tool, for which the member states should increase staff and improve training in European legislation and cross-border issues. The protection of employees should be the top priority, and better cooperation between the national authorities and the European Labor Authority (ELA) is also necessary. This also includes suitable offers for advice and participation. The ELA's mandate should be extended to third-country nationals.
We welcome closer cooperation between the ELA and the trade unions. It should also be given a stronger role for joint coordinated inspections.
We want to take further measures to prevent abusive practices by subcontractors, such as enshrining joint and several liability in law. Time and again, workers are housed in catastrophic conditions, in overcrowded rooms, in poor hygienic conditions and with overpriced rent that is deducted directly from their wages. We therefore want to legally secure and effectively enforce the obligation to provide adequate accommodation.
An effective fight against labor exploitation begins with ensuring that those affected can inform themselves easily and in their own language about their rights - and receive help to enforce them. We are committed to long-term and reliable funding for the creation and Europe-wide networking of appropriate advice centers.
and support structures. With their technical expertise, trade unions are valuable partners in the development and implementation of such offers.
We welcome the fact that European payments in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy will in future be made dependent on compliance with labor standards in agriculture. This so-called social conditionality must now be implemented effectively.
Reducing child poverty
One in four children in Europe is at risk of poverty and social exclusion - that equates to almost 20 million children who have very limited access to healthy food, sport, education and culture. Child poverty means, on the one hand, existential deprivation in the here and now and, on the other, fewer opportunities for a self-determined and successful life in the future. We want all children to have access to a well-developed care and social infrastructure. Their future and the promotion of their potential will determine our future as a society. The European Child Guarantee is intended to ensure that every child at risk of poverty and social exclusion in Europe has access to free healthcare, early childhood care, education and upbringing, adequate housing and a healthy diet.
This is particularly important for children who
currently have poor opportunities. We want to ensure that the Child Guarantee is implemented throughout Europe with concrete measures.
In implementing the Child Guarantee in Germany, we are also actively involving civil society as well as children and young people. With the Child Guarantee, the federal government has launched a key instrument in the fight against child poverty in Germany on our initiative. It is a necessary step towards ensuring that children at risk of poverty are better off, that poverty is no longer hidden and that parents can live a more carefree and anxiety-free life because they and their children are protected. We are committed to ensuring that the shift away from the parents' obligation to collect and towards the state's obligation to provide is implemented throughout Europe. In order to benefit more from each other
In order to learn from our experience, we promote Europe-wide exchange on how families can be better supported and how a good upbringing can be ensured for all children in Europe.
Strengthening children's rights
Children have independent rights. They have a right to participate and require our special protection and care. The welfare of the child must be given priority in all matters concerning children. Particular attention must be paid to protecting children from violence and neglect. We want to further develop and consistently implement the EU child rights strategy. We want to promote European research and practical projects in the field of child protection and children's rights in order to make national experiences, practices and models usable for the further development of child protection everywhere.
Anchoring minimum social standards
Over 95 million people in the EU are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The high cost of living has exacerbated people's social situation, in some cases to an existential level. We want everyone in Europe to be able to rely on strong social systems that protect them from poverty. To achieve this, the welfare states of the member states need binding minimum standards.
We want to develop the existing European recommendation for adequate minimum security systems into a binding directive and link the standards set out therein with an individual entitlement to social rights for those affected in the member states. As part of this, all member states should gradually make their social systems poverty-proof in line with their respective levels of prosperity, promote sustainable integration into good work and expand the social infrastructure. For Germany, too, this means a tailwind for a strong welfare state and more social justice.
Making social security crisis-proof
The welfare state must prove its worth, especially in times of crisis. Better precautions against the economic and social consequences of external shocks must therefore be a key lesson from the crises of recent years. The fair participation of all citizens makes an important contribution to this. The social systems of the member states must be made crisis-proof and enable fast and effective protection for people in emergency situations.
However, crisis-induced mass unemployment with high social costs and hardship is overwhelming many EU member states. Its consequences destabilize the entire EU. The European crisis instrument SURE provided member states with financial loans and guarantees during the coronavirus pandemic in order to create jobs through the use of
of short-time working benefits - a great success. The instrument saved an estimated 1.5 million jobs in Europe in 2020 alone. Building on this experience, we want to createa permanent crisis instrument in the form of unemployment reinsurance for the member states, which will support national unemployment insurance schemes.
In times of multiple crises, young adults need perspectives that encourage them and a system that supports them in an emergency. This is why we are continuing to focus on European youth unemployment. The European Youth Guarantee is a way of opening up career prospects for young people and integrating them into the labor market as skilled workers. We welcome its strengthening in the context of the corona pandemic and continue to advocate for its continuation. In particular, we want t o further develop the standards of the training and qualification offers. With good advice and training, every young adult in Europe has the chance to learn a trade.
Making housing affordable
Housing is one of the central social issues of our time. For us, housing is a fundamental right
and must be secured as part of services of general interest. We want secure housing for all people. Affordable housing is particularly scarce in cities, with rising rents in many places and a declining stock of social housing putting a strain on tenants right up to the middle of society and leading to displacement and insecurity. In major European cities, a particularly large amount of living space is being used for short-term rentals and thus withdrawn from the rental market.
Rising rents must not exacerbate social inequality and poverty risks, for example for older people. We want to quickly create more affordable housing and limit rising rents - for example with refurbishments of existing buildings and interior insulation, sustainable construction, a skilled labor offensive and improved investments via the European Investment Bank (EIB). We are combating the housing shortage with additional barrier-free and disabled-accessible housing.
Investors who are buying up large amounts of urban residential real estate and valuable building land across Europe are driving up property and rental prices in many places.
upwards. The Europe-wide concentration on a few investors in the housing market harms competition and people. We are committedto transparent business practices. We are scrutinizing the existing European regulations in order to better protect tenants in the member states from rising prices and to safeguard the quality of our housing. This also includes protecting households from index- linked rental contracts. In light of the rising cost of living, we want to cap existing index-linked rents and restrict new ones, and we want to initiate a land turnaround in Europe. We are committed to protecting the scarce resource of land in the EU from speculation. We welcome long-term rental and lease models by the public sector instead of short-term sales. We want to integrate the land and real estate market more closely into EU competition law. We want to make the valuation of real estate and land Europe-wide oriented towards the common good. To this end, we also want to tackle a change in international accounting standards so that CO2 emissions can be integrated across all sectors.
and other socio-ecological values can be included in the financial valuation.
Homelessness violates human dignity and is one of the most extreme forms of poverty. The EU has set itself the ambitious goal of ending homelessness by 2030 and has launched a European Platform to Combat Homelessness. We want to implement its measures quickly. The dialog between the member states must be further strengthened. The opportunity to learn from each other and to adapt proven concepts such as Housing First or social housing agencies across the board should be strengthened.
We are committed to more effective prevention, sufficient living space and more individual, humane and less bureaucratic services for the people affected. These should also provide better care for people with mental illnesses and addictions. We want to expand European funding for corresponding plans and projects.
2. Strong regions
Strengthening municipalities
The strength and attractiveness of the EU also lies in the diversity of its regions and municipalities.
They are the foundation of the EU. This is where people live, learn and work. Strong municipalities thrive in a strong Europe, which attaches particular importance to municipal needs and freedom of action. The principle of subsidiarity - i.e. making decisions as close to the people as possible - is the basis for a Europe that protects and enables. We want to strengthen this principle and ensure the ability to act locally by providing sufficient resources.
This also means that the EU should use its possibilities to provide support where municipalities reach their limits. The everyday lives of citizens take place in Europe's municipalities.
This is where people live and work, where children are looked after and volunteer work is carried out, where people come to cinemas, restaurants, parks or sports facilities.
together. Municipalities form the basis of our social coexistence and, with functioning basic services, also offer attractive locations for companies and employees from all over Europe. The implementation of competition rules must not lead to municipalities being forced to privatize public goods or being restricted in their municipal planning sovereignty. We therefore need good procurement and concession law that focuses on social and ecological criteria - and at the same time strengthens the decisions of the public sector. It promotes legal certainty and enables municipalities to opt for high-quality regional offers. In this way, local authorities themselves can strengthen the added value of public infrastructure. They should also retain the ability to control and limit the use of space in order to ensure a supply close to where people live. By enabling the remunicipalization of past privatisations in the EU, we are creating new scope for local decision-making and reliable services of general interest. We continue to support local authorities in pursuing this path. An EU that defends the municipal scope for action
and expands, ensures quality of life and social
cohesion.
In particular, access to clean and affordable drinking water is an existential basis for a healthy life. Thanks to the success of the Right2Water citizens' initiative, Europe guarantees the highest standards for drinking water worldwide. The supply of drinking water should remain in municipal hands and not be determined by purely market-based economic interests. We therefore defend the exemption of water supply from the Concessions Directive and protect the right to drinking water in the EU.
Europe must be lived on the ground. Municipalities, regions, companies and civil society need a greater say in shaping European policy. That is why we want to strengthen the European Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. Cross- border European cooperation, such as town twinning or
Initiatives to strengthen cross-border regional competitiveness and connectivity (INTERREG programs) strengthen municipalities and regions, as do knowledge transfer and networking programs (e.g. Climate- ADAPT). We want to strengthen these programs. The level of the European regions (Euregios and Eurodistricts) should be made less bureaucratic and more flexible. They contribute with cross-border programs such as advisory services.
We are committed to simplifying the everyday lives of cross-border commuters and binational families by reducing bureaucracy and harmonizing administrative services and processes.
Promoting local cohesion
The success of the Green Deal and the cohesion of the EU will be decided on the ground: on the basis of concrete projects in the European regions. This is where important expertise for shaping change on the ground lies. An efficient funding policy in the EU involves local people and is geared towards the opportunities and challenges of digital and ecological change. We focus on the economic and social convergence of the regions in Europe. The size of the funds and funding programs should be geared towards the challenges.
So far, European regions have been prepared to varying degrees for these challenges. This applies both within and between the European member states. A consistent funding policy based on clear criteria will help to overcome these challenges.
to be both a driving force and a compass. We want to focus on structurally weak and rural regions as well as regions with an industrial character and modernization challenges in order to create equal living conditions for all people.
Demographic change poses a major challenge, particularly in structurally weak regions.
tion. The exodus of skilled workers, especially young people and women, is leading these regions into a spiral of hopelessness.
The EU must counteract this with better support for structurally weak regions. In this way, we strengthen the local shapers of the future and create good prospects for the regions.
Major challenges require a major effort and at the same time efficiency and precision in the use of funds. We ensure this by aligning funding with criteria in line with the European Green Deal. The European Social Fund (ESF+) plays an important role in this. It is also used by us to advise, support and provide lifelong training for numerous founders, employees and jobseekers. The promotion of long-term
projects should not be held up by delays in EU consultations. We are providing the ESF+ with sufficient funds to promote active employment policy and increased social participation, among other things. We are committed to ensuring that the administration of funds is simplified, that the conditions of good work play a major role and that the funds become drivers for a fair EU. A strong commitment to collective wage agreements, good employment and health protection and a wide range of opportunities for training and further education will turn attractive jobs into a locational advantage for the funded regions.
European funding offers a great opportunity to develop innovative projects. However, the programs are often not sufficiently well known and the application for funding and the implementation of the funding are often too complicated. This reduces the number of applications. Some good projects and ideas are not realized. We are changing this by working to simplify access to funding, increase awareness and accelerate the implementation of projects. To simplify the structures, we are reviewing the current system of individual funds. In order to reduce bureaucratic hurdles, we want to introduce, among other things, more packages and funding opportunities that
exempt volunteer applicants from pre-financing after project approval. Reducing bureaucracy thus creates more efficiency.
Every important change requires the participation of local citizens and civil society. A policy of being heard makes use of local expertise and creates mutual understanding.
This knowledge can be incorporated through the partnership for citizen participation (partnership principle). Mechanisms such as citizen dialogues, public consultations or forums should be part of the processes for allocating funds in all member states. Digital and hybrid formats should enable family-friendly participation. This is how we ensure co-determination and democratize the EU's funding policy.
Seizing opportunities in rural areas
Rural areas are spaces of future and opportunity. Their development is a central goal for us. It has a significant impact on cohesion in the EU. The transport transition can bring rural areas closer together, while the energy transition can create new added value and financially strengthen municipalities. Coworking spaces can revitalize town centers. We are also focusing on the rural outskirts of cities with their considerable development potential. Local people should be able to participate in decision-making and benefit from it. To do this, they need reliable services of general interest and places where they can meet and exchange ideas.
We want to strengthen services of general interest by supporting citizens' cooperatives and multifunctional facilities that, for example, carry out intergenerational projects with young and older people. In order to
To achieve this, we want to further strengthen funding approaches such as LEADER to support rural regions and the multi-fund approach in structural policy. Support for rural areas via the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) should be better dovetailed and expanded with the so-called cohesion funds and thus make a better contribution to the structural development of rural areas.
creates additional added value here. To this end, it should be fed into the electricity grid and used in a decentralized manner. We want to secure the necessary land, but minimize land consumption and consistently consider multiple uses, for example through agri-photovoltaic systems, biodiversity photovoltaics or more renewable electricity generation on sealed surfaces. We will continue to drive forward the expansion of renewables and support the modernization of the economy and society through the targeted use of subsidies in a way that benefits local people.
Regional agricultural value chains and near-natural forest management continue to be important economic factors and are characteristic of these areas.
Modernizing public procurement law
A genuine infrastructure union, a strong European market and the implementation of the Green Deal throughout the EU go hand in hand with massive investment in a secure future, at both national and European level. With public procurement law based on social and sustainable criteria, these investments will once again become the driving force for a fair and future-proof EU. We can make a big difference, especially where we invest in stable European infrastructure, efficient electricity grids, a reliable rail network or a people-oriented healthcare system. Boosting the European infrastructure union has positive effects on the European labor market: new jobs are being created in these sectors in particular. These jobs should also begood jobs. Strong public procurement law secures the future of many workers throughout the EU.
The state itself is a major economic player. We want to use this huge lever. Whether services or goods: Public procurement in the EU should be consistently sustainable and oriented towards the common good. We therefore want to modernize the Public Procurement Directive and align it with sustainability and public interest criteria. This also favors the awarding of contracts to small and medium-sized enterprises and thus strengthens regional value creation.
An intact public space and the fulfillment of public tasks are the basis of our social coexistence. We want the EU to take measures so that tasks can not only be put out to tender, but also awarded.
Transparency, less bureaucracy, digitalization, acceleration and uncomplicated procedures remain our guiding principles. Necessary investments should not be unduly delayed. Every company should be able to bid for public contracts easily and successfully. Waste of money is minimized through a clear procurement policy.
Simple communication of the rules and active support for small and local providers, for example with references to the legal framework, ensure fairness. The awarding of public contracts thus becomes a competition for the best conditions.
3. Reliable healthcare
Overcoming health crises at European level
We want a Europe that works together to protect and promote the health of all people.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown once again that the major challenges facing our health know no national borders. It has also shown us that we can tackle them better together. The rapid development and availability of coronavirus vaccines, for example, was also a European success that came about thanks to many years of research, innovative companies and cross-border cooperation. During the pandemic, the EU has driven forward the joint procurement of protective equipment and vaccines, strengthened joint research activities, coordinated the free movement of people and goods during border closures and cushioned economic emergencies.
The competencies of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have also been expanded in order to facilitate the exchange of information.
with and between the member states and to recognize and overcome health crises at an earlier stage.
In order to better manage cross-border health crises and strengthen crisis preparedness, we want to work together even more closely at European and global level. The EU has an important role to play here in ordertoensurethat national measures
and supplement the measures taken. It can also exert an important influence globally. At international level, we are committed to strengthening the World Health Organization (WHO) and multilateral health initiatives politically, financially and in terms of personnel, promoting the innovative power of European health research more strongly and improving global access to affordable medicines and healthcare services for all people, which is a question of solidarity, as health crises often hit the poorest hardest. But it is also in our own interests, because pandemics are global challenges. We are committed to the active transfer of technology and knowledge regarding the production of key medicines. Monopolies on intellectual property to combat diseases must not prevent access to vital protective materials, health technologies, vaccines and medicines. Where voluntary production partnerships are not sufficient, we support applications for the granting of mandatory licenses in return for compensation for these goods in health crises and pandemic situations and advocate for the temporary suspension of patents at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in these contexts. our goal is for all EU citizens to have health insurance. We therefore want better coordination of social security systems in the EU - including direct billing options between health insurance providers.
Strengthening preventionWe place prevention and health promotion at the heart of our health policy. This is how we can prevent diseases from developing in the first place. Good prevention structures, better information about the risks of illness and a healthy lifestyle are
important building blocks for a better quality of life and a longer life expectancy. In this way, we can also prevent diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. To make it easier for consumers toeat healthily, we want to provide reliable information about the ingredients in food. We want to prevent the development of tobacco and alcohol-related diseases as far as possible. This requires greater efforts to reduce risky forms of alcohol consumption and tobacco use, for example by reducing the nicotine content in tobacco and nicotine products. We are committed to the goals of the European Beating Cancer Plan. According to this plan, the proportion of smokers in the EU population should fall below 5 percent by 2040.
Gaps that still exist in advertising - for example on
social platforms and particularly in the area of sponsorship - must now be closed across the EU. The protection of minors also requires us to push ahead with advertising restrictions for alcohol, gambling and sports betting. In order to be able to better counter future health crises, we want to strengthen preventive health research in addition to research into the causes of diseases and new treatment methods.
The EU should work towards intensifying global cooperation in the area of the authorization and monitoring of medicinal products.
Learning lessons from the pandemic
Even if the most visible signs of the corona pandemic have disappeared with the lockdown restrictions or the mask requirement, many people are still suffering from the consequences of a Covid-19 infection (long/post-Covid) and quite a few from the much less common consequences of a Covid-19 vaccination (post-Vac). We therefore want to intensify research into infectious diseases such as Covid-19 and their sequelae (e.g. myocarditis or ME/CFS) at European level and make research funding available for this purpose. We also need more European exchange, for example through an EU network of experts.
Prevention is at the heart of everything we do. For people with illnesses and shadow families in particular, this is an important building block for equal participation in society. This also includes making healthy indoor air a matter of course.pandemics do not affect everyone equally. People on low incomes, those in precarious employment and people in large institutions are significantly more likely to be affected by Covid-
19. These groups must be given greater attention during the next pandemic.
Covid-19 is - alongside AIDS or Ebola, for example - another case of a so-called zoonosis, i.e. a disease that is transmitted from animals to humans. The corona pandemic thus underlines once again that human health should not be viewed in isolation, but is closely linked to the environment and animal health. This is why planetary health and the One Health approach are guiding principles for our health policy: sufficient space for animals and nature and a reduction in industrially farmed livestock help in the fight against zoonoses; fewer antibiotics in factory farming leads to less antibiotic resistance; clean air and fewer toxins in the environment save human lives.
In particular, we need an effective European early warning system against pandemics in order to be able to identify dangerous pathogens at an early stage and make information about them available in a transparent manner. At the same time, pandemic scenarios must be practised regularly, above all to ensure that a crisis and emergency organization can be set up quickly.
Focusing on mental health
War, inflation, climate crisis, pandemic - the past few years have been turbulent, conflict-ridden and characterized by crises and upheavals that have left no-one unscathed. For many people, this period is also a psychological burden. For many young people in particular, psychological problems have worsened. We set
We are committed to ensuring that mental health receives the attention it deserves and that those affected no longer have to suffer from stigmatization. We also want to achieve this with support from Europe. We are committed to both improved Europe-wide prevention and to improving existing approaches to mental health and better treatment of illnesses. To improve patient safety
In order to guarantee the quality of creative therapies, comparable legal regulations and protected professional designations are needed across Europe, such as for artistic therapies. We support research into creative therapy approaches and advocate the networking of experts in Europe and want to develop comprehensive solution strategies together with the member states, also in order to further strengthen community-based, human rights-based care, increase care security and avoid coercive measures. As the causes of mental health problems are manifold, we must also tackle them at all levels. That is why we are committed to ensuring that the impact on mental health is minimized.
health must be considered across the board in all relevant policy areas. This also applies to the effects of mental illness and neurodiversity. This requires greater awareness of the problem in the EU and its institutions. In this respect, we welcome the EU Commission's strategy for mental health and are committed to implementing it as quickly and comprehensively as possible.
More and more people in Europe are also experiencing loneliness. This is often a very stressful situation for those affected. Older people in particular are also affected. The pandemic has further exacerbated the situation for many people in this regard. With our policies, we are committed to greater social cohesion, inclusion, participation and integration.
Ensuring the supply of medicines
The challenges facing European healthcare systems are immense: ageing societies, an increasing number of chronic diseases and epidemics. The corona pandemic has
also made it clear that the EU is too dependent on manufacturers with unreliable supply chains for medicinal products and their active ingredients. and therefore often accepts production under poor working conditions and poor environmental standards. Vulnerable groups suffer particularly from drug shortages.
In order to address the major challenges facing the healthcare sector, the EU Commission has presented a legislative package to reform the pharmaceutical sector. We welcome the proposals, which aim to diversify supply chains and make them more sustainable, as well as to oblige pharmaceutical companies to better prevent drug shortages and report them earlier. Pharmacies also contribute to a reliable supply of medicines.
In order to encourage companies to develop and produce new medicines, active ingredients and medical devices in Europe, incentives and less bureaucratic procedures are needed. We have two priorities here: Firstly, critical medicines that are indispensable at all times, such as important antibiotics, must be reliably available through crisis-proof supply chains. The partial relocation of production back to Europe can contribute to this. On the other hand, new incentives for the development of medical innovations must be created for previously neglected diseases and in view of the emergence of therapy resistance.
This includes, in particular, new financing models such as adapted remuneration models for reserve antibiotics. Incentives for research and development and the protection of intellectual property must not jeopardize the affordability of essential medicines and disproportionately delay the market entry of generics. We are also committed to gender-sensitive research and medicine so that gaps in knowledge about gender- specific differences in diagnosis and treatment are closed and taken into account. Studies in the field of pediatric and adolescent medicine should also be intensified to ensure that access to safe and effective medicines is improved.
becomes. At the same time, greater consideration must be given to the diversity of people, especially in studies on new drugs and treatment methods.
It is far too opaque how prices for medicines are set. The lack of transparency and accountability in this area sometimes leads to immense price increases. Especially when public funds are used for drug development, this must generally be accompanied by transparency regarding the costs of research and development as well as pricing. In addition, publicly funded development projects should ensure that
resulting medicines are made sufficiently accessible in countries of the Global South.
Using health data securely
Digitalization in the healthcare sector has great advantages for patient healthcare and research. Diseases can be better diagnosed, the causes of diseases can be researched, unnecessary examinations can be avoided and the treatment of patients between different doctors and hospitals can be simplified across borders throughout Europe. The European Health Data Space should therefore enable EU-wide access to digital patient records.
We want to strengthen patients' rights through effective data protection, comprehensive IT security and personal access to the data stored about them. The
is fundamental to people's trust in the processing of health data. Fundamental transparency in data management and technical solutions such as a digital consent assistant can support this. After all, personal health information is some of the most sensitive and personal data of all.
and at the same time not to pass on any data against the patient's will, we rely on the possibility of objection (opt-out) and the focus on the protection of personal data in the case of pseudonymized health data.
good data quality. In this way, we want to increase the availability of data for public-benefit research and provide public authorities with better assessment options in emergency situations. This represents an important paradigm shift in the use of health data, which we want to shape. Access to and analysis of larger amounts of data promotes innovation potential and can therefore improve patient care. Traceability of data should be excluded as far as possible and violations of this should be prosecuted. Comprehensive protection against discrimination for all and, in particular, the needs of vulnerable groups must be taken into account in a comprehensive manner. standardized data formats and interfaces are fundamental to the success of digitalization in the healthcare sector in order to enable the consolidation of data and cross-border use in Europe. We therefore want to ensure the development and mandatory use of internationally used data standards and interoperable interfaces by the software systems right from the start.
Curbing antibiotic resistance
Antibiotics can save human lives. This should also be guaranteed in the future. Measures must therefore be taken to guarantee their long-term effectiveness. By using antibiotics responsibly, we want to prevent the emergence and spread of multi-resistant germs. After all, these are one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity.
Particularly in people with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, children or people with pre- existing conditions, they lead to the emergence of multi-resistant germs every year.
to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. It is therefore important that antibiotics and highly potent disinfectants are only used wherethey are really needed or where they are appropriate. We want to strengthen the prudent use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine and promote research. In addition, rapid diagnostic tests that check whether treatment with antibiotics is necessary before prescribing should be available in sufficient quantities.
We want to align the EU list of reserve antibiotics, which are reserved for human medicine and may not be used in industrial animal husbandry, with the corresponding WHO criteria. We also want to end the import of animal products in which antibiotics banned in the EU have been used. We want to reduce the entry of antibiotic residues into the environment through measures to improve hygiene and wastewater disposal. We want to promote the development of new antibiotics and effective alternative treatment methods through incentives.
Ensuring good care
A strong public and non-discriminatory healthcare system and needs-based care and assistance for older, sick and disabled people are essential to protect human dignity and promote self- determination. The shortage of nursing staff is becoming increasingly acute, both in the EU and here in Germany. We therefore want to increase the attractiveness of the nursing profession, facilitate the free movement of professionals within the EU in this area and improve the working conditions of nursing staff. Our aim is to simplify recognition procedures for degrees as well as for initial and further training for nursing professionals within the EU and from abroad. As part of the EU care strategy, we advocate competitive working conditions and salaries in professional care compared to other sectors. Appreciation also needs wages that reflect this - ideally through good collective agreements. In addition, more investment is needed in care facilities, especially in forms of housing and care that enable people to live independently in their own neighborhoods and living environments, care services and the training and further education of care professionals. We also want to promote greater EU involvement in research and model projects as well as a transfer of knowledge and experience to improve working conditions in health and care facilities in the member states.
In order to improve the situation of care workers in home care, we are calling for a revision of occupational health and safety legislation to ensure that employed care workers in private households are also included and have good working conditions. In the coming decades, there will be a further increase in the number of people in need of care and suffering from dementia. Our aim is to enable these people to lead a dignified, self-determined and active life.
In order to drive forward more innovations in the area of care and participation, we want to strengthen the European exchange on new approaches, for example on inclusive forms of housing and care, neighborhood-oriented support and personal assistance. We also want to provide better support and relief for family caregivers and loved ones. This is why we are working at a European level to ensure that family caregivers, the majority ofwhom are women, have good social security and do not fall into old-age poverty due to care responsibilities. Their skills acquired in care work should be recognized and access to further training should be promoted.
We also want to implement the requirements of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the care sector.
Legalize cannabis across Europe
We are also committed to a modern drug policy in Europe that prioritizes health and the protection of young people and effectively combats the criminal structures behind the drug trade. In Europe, too, the purely repressive approach to drugs has brought more suffering than blessings, thousands of drug-related deaths and an important source of income for organized crime. What is needed is a drug policy based on science and risk-based assessment. In various places around the world, the shift to a risk-based approach to cannabis has already been successful. With the regulation of cannabis, we are focusing on reason instead of criminalization. We are striving for EU-wide legalization and controlled dispensing of cannabis.
national law currently imposes strict limits on the member states when dealing with cannabis. We want to extend this so that each country can decide for itself. At the same time, we are strengthening prevention and the protection of minors.
The increase in problematic drug use, new and synthetic substances and the consequences of social impoverishment in public spaces pose a major challenge. They pose dangers for consumers, pose particular challenges for authorities and require social measures, and we must take more effective action against invisible and visible addiction problems. This is why we are intensifying cross-border cooperation in the interests of health protection. In addition, we want to
improve health care for addicts, turn away from repression in dealing with users, strengthen social support structures and improve access to treatment. We also want to further advance research into the use of psychoactive substances, in particular their medical benefits, in European research networks.
4. Education and opportunities
Networking Europe's universities better
The European Higher Education Area contributes to making higher education in Europe more comparable and internationally competitive and is invaluable for promoting academic mobility.
Europe's universities are an important part of the education system, a place for shaping the future, for critical self-reflection in society and for social and technological innovation. If we network them, we can make even better use of their diverse skills and profiles for the entire continent. We have therefore long been committed to establishing and strengthening European university networks. We promote the use of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in teaching and education. We want to shape these in such a way that teachers, students and pupils can use them independently and confidently.
The new applications must be designed in a socially fair and non-discriminatory way. Access to these new applications must be designed to be socially fair and non-discriminatory.
In line with the idea of a European degree, we support the further development of the European approach as part of the Bologna Process in order to facilitate the recognition of joint programmes and joint degrees and to create incentives for the internationalization of degree programmes.
Regardless of the country, students rarely have a lot of money at their disposal. Visits to museums, theaters, but also excursions to other cities, for example, open up new horizons. Many of these institutions offer discounts for students. But especially for students from other countries
It is often difficult for students to obtain these benefits with their home student ID cards. With the European Student Card (ESC) and the digital student card in the Erasmus+ app, the EU has already taken the first steps towards a European student card, but only for a very limited group of people. We want all students at European universities and higher education institutions to be able to obtain a (digital) European student card.
Recognizing professional qualifications throughout Europe
The opportunity to study or work in any European country opens up many new perspectives.
However, when it comes down to it, things often become difficult: we have created a comparable degree system in the EU with the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in the Bologna Process. But it is not automatic, for example, that a Bachelor's degree from one country will be recognized for a Master's degree in another country. Students and graduates, including those in further vocational training, have to go through an often still very bureaucratic procedure in the respective country. In some cases, the domestic degree is then given less value.
In some cases, recognition is very costly. That is why we are committed to ensuring that vocational training qualifications and educational qualifications within the framework of the European Qualifications Framework are more easily and quickly recognized in every EU country instead of having to be laboriously recognized.
It is even more difficult with professional qualifications. Here, recognition is often complicated, lengthy and expensive. In times of skills shortages, this is particularly counterproductive. For a handful of professions, people can therefore apply for the European Professional Card (EPC) in their home country. This electronic procedure makes it easier to have a qualification in a regulated profession recognized in another EU country. We want to significantly increase the number of professions for which the EBA is possible. We want to improve the position of applicants by introducing comparable recognition procedures across Europe and offering comprehensive guidance and support through multilingual advice and information services.
Political education against disinformation
Our democracies and our values are under constant attack from authoritarian and anti- democratic movements at home and abroad. Their means: disinformation, fake news and manipulation of their distribution mechanisms as well as deliberate disruption and flooding of digital debate spaces. They are increasingly operating across borders and trying to undermine cohesion in the EU and our European values. Their conspiracy myths sow hatred and exclusion. We need to counter this more strongly and in a coordinated manner across Europe. We therefore want to establish a European Center for Civic Education, a point of contact for civic education that specifically addresses the European dimension of disinformation. It should primarily address young people and young adults, but at the same time be available to all citizens as a source of information and create a wide range of offers in the digital space. This European Center for Civic Education is also intended to
People in the EU candidate countries are open.
It can explain the European idea and complex European processes in a way that is appropriate for the target group. This center should also strengthen people's digital media literacy in times of disinformation and fake news. To this end, it can also promote the networking of European players in research and education. It should be able to work independently and according to clear scientific and ethical criteria.
In this way, we promote our democratic values and strengthen the fight against discrimination.
Get to know Europe with Erasmus
For many, Erasmus+ is their first and often most personal encounter with the EU. Erasmus+ promotes a living European community and facilitates academic and professional exchange.
Student exchanges are at the heart of the program: we want more people to be able to have these experiences, especially those from families who lack the money for vacations or exchange time abroad. This means thatwe need to increase financial support for stays abroad. We are therefore campaigning for an increase in Erasmus funding. For many people, leaving home to go abroad is a big step and the prospect of not being able to afford to visit family during this time is a barrier. That's why we want to introduce a mobility ticket for Erasmus participants, which would allow them to travel to and from their place of residence once every semester free of charge, for example. To make it easier to integrate semesters abroad into the curriculum, we are striving to harmonize semester times.
We want people with disabilities to be able to opt for a valuable Erasmus+ experience. That is why we want to expand the advisory services (e.g. information on national contact points for assistance) before and during the project implementation and make information available without barriers
and ensure that the additional costs are covered. We want to work with the UK to find ways in which people on both sides can benefit from exchanges again after Brexit.
Many students are familiar with Erasmus+. However, trainees are not yet sufficiently familiar with the program. We want to change that. After all, it offers many opportunities to learn new professional skills and gain new experiences. We want to strengthen Erasmus+ for trainees with better information, more advice and simpler applications and recognition.
We want to enable as many trainees as possible to participate in the Erasmus+ program by offering support to small craft businesses.
Erasmus+ is one of Europe's success stories, including for youth work. With a view to the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework from 2028, we will work to double the funding for Erasmus+.
5. Europe's youth
Involving young people
Europe thrives on community, encounters, tolerance and mutual understanding. To make this possible, European and international youth work plays an extraordinary role. It enables young people to think outsidethe box and make friends across Europe. Youth associations and youth groups are the basis for the leisure and educational activities of millions of young people in Europe. In our civil society, we must ensure that the voluntary commitment of young people is valued and that youth work does not fall victim to bureaucratic hurdles. We are therefore in favor of strengthening and simplifying project funding via Erasmus+. We want to make Europe more tangible and easier to experience, especially for young people in our eastern neighboring countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic. We want to strengthen European youth work and focus on Eastern Europe.
Many people talk about young people and their needs. We want them to have their say and have a say in the Europe in which they live. They are currently massively underrepresented in the political arena. That is why it is good that young people in Germany aged 16 and over can now vote in the European elections for the first time. We are committed to ensuring that this becomes a
r e a l i t y a t a l l levels in all member states and in Germany.
Beyond the right to vote, we also want to further strengthen youth participation in Europe in structural terms. Through the EU Youth Dialogue, the EU has created a direct channel for the participation of young people and youth associations at European level. This is to be further strengthened and integrated into other participation formats. The results of these consultations should be incorporated even more strongly into the work of the EU Commission in future and young people and their representatives should be regularly consulted in future.
be heard in the European Parliament. We also support the EU Youth Check, which aims to review the impact of EU decisions on young people. The EU Youth Strategy sets out the guidelines for European youth policy. We want ensure that the further development of the EU Youth Strategy strengthens the interests of young people in all policy areas. To this end, existing participation formats for young people must be sensibly linked, structurally safeguarded and their connection to national participation structures ensured, and we are also committed to upgrading the position of EU Youth Coordinator.
Expanding voluntary services
A community is only as strong as the commitment of its members. Civil society has a special role to play here. The commitment of young Europeans in particular is fundamental - for example in refugee aid, projects to promote democracy, climate protection or social justice.
That is why we want to create one million places in the European Voluntary Service, especially for young people from low-income families. We must ensure better framework conditions for them, such as appropriate compensation, so that volunteering is something that everyone can afford. However, voluntary services also need clubs, associations and organizations to offer them. We want to strengthen these, as they create places of democracy and civic engagement. With a Voluntary Ecological Year (FÖJ or EYE - European Year for Ecology), we enable young people aged 18 and over to engage in an intercultural European exchange in the field of nature conservation and thus create the opportunity to stand up for Europe's nature.
Through the FÖJ, we want to motivate young
people to prepare and qualify for jobs in the climate and environmental sector.
We don't just want to offer this idea to young people. We also want to harness the experience, knowledge and commitment of senior citizens throughout Europe: Many of them have knowledge that they still want to use when they retire. With a European program, we want to provide the framework for senior citizens to participate in projects throughout the EU.
can work in training, placement or civil society.
Discover Europe
With the DiscoverEU program, 18-year-olds can experience the EU first-hand. Twice a year, so- called travel passes are raffled off among young people, allowing them to travel through Europe by train for 30 days during a specific period.
Together with other young people from different countries, they can discover just how diverse Europe is. This is why we support the DiscoverEU program and want to expand it in the future. Our aim is to create more shared experiences from many parallel journeys. We want to make the program better known, especially among young people from less affluent backgrounds. We also want to create incentives for
Groups from several European countries traveling together.
6. For an age-friendly Europe
The average age of people in Europe is the highest of any region in the world, and the trend is rising. We want demographic change to be seen as a challenge and an opportunity for us all. The knowledge, life experience and activity of Europe's older citizens can be an important factor for the cohesion of society. Thousands of elderly volunteers prove this every day: older people are discriminated against or excluded in many contexts, but this is often not immediately recognizable as such. That is why we want to better protect older people throughout Europe from discrimination in the workplace and in everyday life and create equal opportunities.
Accessibility in the world of work and in public spaces is important, and we want as many municipalities and regions in Europe as possible to join the global network of age-friendly cities and municipalities.
"Age-friendly cities and communities" of the WHO. Age-friendly cities and communities are also child-, family- and disability-friendly, and one of the network's aims is to enable people to age healthily, safely and independently in their living environment. People in old age and with increasing age-related limitations should also be able to remain in their own four walls, including barrier- free public transport networks and housing construction as well as heat protection measures for the elderly. We also advocate for more public places and opportunities that are designed in such a way that the generations can meet, interact and learn from each other in everyday life. In order to improve the situation of older people internationally, we will campaign for a UN convention on the rights of older people.
Everyone in Europe should have the opportunity to learn any other European language free of charge and without discrimination. For this
we want to advocate the creation of a European language learning app that can be used to learn any other European language. This is how we strengthen European identity.
7. Consumer protection
Understanding consumer protection as a locational advantage
The legal protection of consumers makes the EU a union of strong citizens. The freedoms for goods, capital, services and people in the European single market are among the EU's greatest locational advantages.
Consumer protection provides far-reaching safeguards for consumption, health and freedoms, making the EU a global pioneer: fee-free roaming, a user-friendly electricity market, modern infrastructure and safe and durable consumer goods are just a few examples.
And it works: a uniform charging cable for mobile devices, for example, promises to put an end to the tangle of cables in countless drawers. The binding European standard strengthens the European circular economy, reduces electronic waste and makes consumers' lives noticeably easier. We want to cover the entire spectrum of digital devices such as smartwatches, e-readers and headphones and also include wireless charging technologies.
Binding eco-design, i.e. production according to criteria of durability, reparability and ecological compatibility, provides consumers with better products. We are committed to the rapid implementation of the directives so that relevant product groups such as toys, furniture and clothing are covered in a timely manner.
If a product does break down, the European right to repair promises consumers long-term access to spare parts and repair instructions. A broken smartphone battery, printer or vacuum cleaner does not necessarily mean a new purchase. The lifespan of expensive or cherished purchases
is extended considerably with the right to repair. This means that durable and repairable products will be easier on people's wallets.
Update cycles and expiring update periods must be based on comprehensible and rational criteria. It is not in the interests of consumers if they are forced to buy new devices due to short update periods. This
We want to put a stop to "planned obsolescence" in the hardware and software sector.
Being able to use everyday products safely is becoming a matter of course with the EU. From food and clothing to cosmetics, toys and simple everyday items, safety comes first. Harmful substances, nanoparticles and residues of semi- metals or heavy metals that are harmful to health are found in many of these consumer and consumer goods. To ensure safety and transparency, we are expanding risk research and creating a register for nanoparticles.
We also want to shape the design of the European electricity market in the interests of consumers so that the price advantages of renewable energies are widely available. With transparent infrastructure costs that are as low as possible, the decoupling of the consumption price of renewable electricity from the rising costs of emissions trading and intelligent load management, the advantage of low-cost electricity generation remains with them.we protect electricity consumers from high costs by supplementing the promotion of renewable energies with a cap on revenues. We also strengthen consumer participation by enabling time-flexible electricity tariffs and simplified prosu- ming. This makes it easy to integrate heat pumps or wall boxes for electric cars into the electricity market, for example, and we are paying particular attention to protecting consumers in the area of medical products and aids. The plight of particularly vulnerable consumers is often exploited. Above all, we want to protect older people, carers and people with disabilities from unsuitable or overpriced products and give them access to individually tailored aids.
In order to combat the addictive mechanisms of betting, gambling and games on the Internet, which seek to entice users to wager more and more money, we will make it easier to identify mechanics with addictive potential and take greater account of them in age classifications across Europe.
Guarantee passenger rights
Freedom of travel in the EU should be comfortable and safe for all citizens. Passengers should be protected in their rights when traveling through Europe - whether by bus, train or plane. This is another reason why we want to use a cross- provider ticketing system to enable booking platforms to offer consistent tickets across borders, making traveling by train more attractive and significantly reducing planning costs. Meeting the needs of people with disabilities
We are committed to the comprehensive protection of passenger rights. Compensation for train delays should be increased to 50 percent of the ticket price after 60 minutes and 75 percent after 90 minutes, as called for by the European Parliament. In terms of the right to barrier-free mobility, we advocate the assumption of costs for alternative transportation options if the promised accessibility has not been met.
In addition, the rights of EU citizens, especially cross- border workers, should also apply to companies with different regional operations. We are committed to uniform minimum standards in local and regional transport. These should also apply to discounted tickets and interrupted travel chains.
Anyone who decides to travel by air should also arrive at their destination safely and on time. The amendment of air passenger rights is intended to close the existing gaps in consumer protection for air travel and further expand rights. We are strengthening consumers' entitlement to compensation in the event of delays or postponements of air travel. Travelers' claims should be
be included in the regulation in the event of a long delay of three hours or more. If flights are postponed, the deadline for informing travelers should be extended to four weeks before the start of the trip. References to the claim
on compensation should be placed prominently throughout.
Especially for travelers who only fly occasionally and families, the regulations for taking baggage with them are often intransparent and complicated. We are committed to a standardized regulation for the dimensions of carry-on baggage and transparent pricing for all baggage variants.
Cancellations must not be at the expense of passengers. That is why we want all airlines to have to insure themselves against insolvency.
Protect yourself from cost traps
should be the termination. Consumers often find it impossible to terminate contracts concluded online or have no certainty about the receipt and legal security of the termination. Being tied to unwanted or no longer needed contracts quickly becomes a cost trap. For long-term contracts that can be concluded online, we want to introduce an easily accessible termination button on the company's website. In this way, we will ensure a high level of consumer protection throughout Europe, following the German model. This will make the Europe-wide use of services simpler and safer. The burden of proof for proper implementation should lie with the companies. If this is not legally secure, this will not be to the detriment of consumers: Contracts should then be able to be terminated at any time without notice. We are committed to supplementing the relevant consumer directive and thus giving customers back control over their contracts.
Concluding contracts online has long been part of everyday life for many people and makes things much easier. Just as uncomplicated as concluding
 What protects peace 
The Russian war of aggression against our European neighbor Ukraine has shown that peace, freedom, security and human rights cannot be taken for granted: Peace and freedom, security and human rights cannot be taken for granted. They must be defended and strengthened again and again. Moscow has challenged the European Union (EU) peace project. We support our Ukrainian friends who are facing up to this challenge with all their strength - and are standing firm together.
But tensions are also increasing worldwide beyond Ukraine. China is becoming increasingly authoritarian, threatening its neighbors and challenging the rule-based international order.
China's competition with democracies around the world also poses significant challenges to our lives and economies. In Africa, Asia and South America, states and societies are calling for
meanwhile rightly demand more representation, a fair say and an equal seat at the negotiating table.
These shifts in the global power structure are challenging the EU. Together with the consequences of the pandemic, inflation, sovereign debt and climate crisis, they once again make it clear that we must join our democratic forces to protect peace in Europe and make a strong European contribution to the security of Europe and the world.
Together we are capable of acting. The EU has proven time and again how capable it is of working internationally for peace, security, the rule of law and sustainable development. It has proven this: Peace can be learned, stabilized and shaped for the benefit of all. The
gives hope in difficult times: An EU that acts confidently and constructively on the world stage and speaks with one voice is able to assert itself against unfreedom and war, defend our interests and values, fend off external influence, shape the future and peace - and noticeably improve people's lives. This Europe offers prospects for political and sustainable economic development worldwide - and thus an urgently needed counter- offer to the influence of China and Russia in particular.
That is our perspective, that is our political mission: the EU's global capacity to act
to defend and strengthen it. When many were still "Change through trade", the Greens have warned that autocratic regimes such as Russia act against the interests of their own citizens in orderto enforce their imperial goals by force. We therefore advocate a sovereign and self-confident Europe that does not wait and see, but takes the reins of action into its own hands; a Europe that frees itself from its dependencies and assumes global responsibility.
An EU that is capable of action and stands on its own two feet is the best protection against all those forces that conjure up isolation and exclusion, both within and outside the European alliance. Above all, the EU can effectively assert its interests if it also places its values at the center - the often claimed contradiction is not one.
Peace and freedom do not come from isolationism, but from values-based and fair dealings with our partners. The most important forum for this is the United Nations (UN) and its organizations, which we want to strengthen and make fairer and more representative. They are the best way to achieve multilateralism in which the strength of the law prevails, not the law of the strongest.
In these challenging times, the EU must actively seek all opportunities for international cooperation and use all channels of cooperation in order to preserve peace, realize human rights, strengthen democratic forces and promote the rule of law.
to prevent conflicts and promote prosperity. In addition to strengthening the relationship with In addition to its allies in the transatlantic and trans-Pacific region, the EU must actively seek partnerships with countries of the Global South.
We want to promote global justice in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. In doing so, we pay attention to the coherence of our political action across all policy areas such as economic and trade policy.
Often enough, however, women in particular are not at the table during negotiations. This makes it more difficult to develop fair and viable solutions. Societies are demonstrably more peaceful and prosperous when all people can participate in political, social and economic life. Peace and security are more sustainable when women are involved.
That is why we
We are actively committed to ensuring that women in particular are represented comprehensively and equally in foreign policy.
The most existential challenge facing humanity, the climate and environmental crisis, can only be tackled globally. Europe and the other industrialized countries have a special historical and dual responsibility due to their decades of emissions: in their own interest, they must quickly become climate-neutral themselves and at the same time support poorer countries in partnership on their path to climate-neutral and climate- adapted prosperity. This is why we are placing climate diplomacy at the center of our plan for a European foreign policy and thus paving the way for resilient partnerships - partnerships that create win-win situations and benefit both the people in our partner countries and help to secure our supply of renewable energy and raw materials. A strong European external climate policy also means that the EU must play a pioneering role in the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and, together with the private sector, make a decisive contribution to the necessary investments for climate-friendly development worldwide. In the same way, Europe must tackle the global biodiversity crisis: pursue ambitious goals itself, finance
and support the countries of the Global South in implementing their goals.
If the worst comes to the worst, we must be able to defend our peace in the alliance militarily. The use of military force remains the last resort for us. For the EU's ability to defend itself, overall national and societal resilience is also indispensable. To this end, it is essential to be able to withstand shocks and disruptions in the sense of a comprehensive concept of security. This includes increasing cyber security and the fight against disinformation, strengthening infrastructures as well as state and economic supply structures and strengthening civil protection. This can
We can do this better, more efficiently and more effectively if we coordinate our security policy at European level and exchange information faster and better. We want a comprehensive approach to European foreign policy that focuses on human security, focuses on the prevention and civilian management of crises and conflicts and actively seeks opportunities for de-escalation.
Those who contribute to maintaining peace prevent the need to create peace - this is how Europe protects itself. The commitment to a culture of non-violence, military restraint and a world without war is an important cross-cutting task that encompasses far more than the area of foreign policy. We think security in terms of each individual person, whose dignity and freedom are at the heart of our policy. This understanding of a precautionary and values-based security policy is part of the European promise.
Its weight, in turn, is most evident where there is invitation and hope. The aspirations of many Ukrainians to assert their freedom and become part of the European family may have been met with brutal armed force by Vladimir Putin. But it lives on and proves the power of the European project beyond its own borders. The idea of a common European home was linked to the wish that people from different nations could live together peacefully under one roof.
It is precisely this wish that Russia has clearly rejected with its war of aggression against Ukraine in violation of international law and against Ukraine's right to self-determination. Nevertheless, we are sticking to this wish. We are committedto the start of Ukraine's accession process - and at the same time see it as recognition of the immeasurable work that the country does every day for the security of us all and for European values.
The Europe we want to shape does exactly that. It protects and defends its own values. It asserts itself - and at the same time confidently reaches out to others. We want to work on this Europe.
This is the Europe we want to be.
1. A European foreign policy
Acting together on foreign policy
We need a strong and sovereign EU that can act as a global political player. So far, however, EU foreign policy still requires the approval of all 27 member states. We advocate an expansion of majority decisions in the Council that takes into account the interests of both the larger and smaller member states. In order to achieve this, we want to use the existing possibilities within the European treaties and at the same time advocate treaty amendments.
Our values and interests need a common EU voice
- we want to turn the existing role of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy into that of a European Foreign Minister. We also want to strengthen the European External Action Service in terms of personnel and institutions. In order to implement a common European foreign policy, we need a genuine European diplomatic service. That is why we want to firmly establish the European Diplomatic Academy in order to develop competencies in the area of EU foreign policy among
diplomats from the member states. We want to increasingly bundle consular services of the member states, such as visa issues, legal assistance or applications, in the European embassies.
At the same time, there is a need for better coordination of the foreign policies of the EU Member States and closer coordination between the European Commission and the European External Action Service. For better democratic control, we advocate a stronger role for the European Parliament in the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
We want to strengthen foreign cultural, education and science policy as well as science diplomacy, which can build cultural bridges in the face of major global challenges, have a positive impact on civil society, advance research and promote peace.
Protecting the climate globally and fairly
The climate crisis is the central global challenge of our time. It threatens livelihoods in many parts of the world and is driving millions of people to flee their homes. It is exacerbating conflicts over increasingly scarce resources such as food, water and raw materials. Its consequences are already having a noticeable negative impact on people's habitats and future opportunities.
No state can stop the climate crisis alone. Our goal is a strong European foreign climate policy that is in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the sustainable development goals. We stand for an EU that establishes global climate partnerships to mitigate climate change.
emissions, supporting partner countries in the socially just and climate-neutral development and restructuring of their economic systems, infrastructure and energy supply as well as in adapting to the unavoidable consequences of the climate crisis. As one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, the EU must, in accordance with the agreement in the Paris Climate Agreement, advocate that USD 100 billion per year from public and private sources for climate change mitigation and adaptation be mobilized quickly, in a targeted and targeted
manner.
in line with the UN's sustainability goals in countries of the Global South. Just Energy Transition Partnerships, which the German government has already concluded with several countries together with other international partners, are a model for this. They make offers for a comprehensive and socially just energy transition and modernization. We are also supporting the international process to design a loss-and-da- mage fund to provide appropriate financial support to communities affected by the effects of the climate crisis.
Our goal is to drive forward socio-ecological modernization in all areas. We are therefore committed to phasing out fossil fuels, a binding global target for the expansion of renewable energies and ambitious climate financing. This requires
additional funds to the Official Development Assistance (ODA) quota, taking into account the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" of the Paris Climate Agreement. International financial institutions such as the World Bank, the regional development banks, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) must play an even greater role in modernizing the economies of our partner countries in a spirit of partnership.
We want to strengthen and expand the Team Europe approach - closer cooperation between the Commission, member states and EU financial institutions - in order to forge international alliances. The climate club proposed by the G7 can play a central role in supporting international structures within the framework of the Paris Agreement and promoting ambitious goals for climate protection, climate adaptation and sustainable growth. We would like to take the Federal Government's planned strategy for foreign climate policy as a basis for further development at European level.
Climate neutrality and the management of climate impacts must be incorporated into our international political action across all departments.
The climate crisis has long been a reality in many places. Despite all our efforts, this c r i s i s will force people to leave their homes.
Historically, the western industrialized countries are the main producers of climate-damaging greenhouse gases and therefore bear a special responsibility. The EU should therefore support the affected countries technically and, if necessary, financially with the necessary adaptation measures. In addition, Europe should lead the way together with other industrialized countries and support processes in which international regulation is discussed with affected states within the framework of international law to deal with climate-induced migration, flight and displacement as well as access to international protection.
Like the climate crisis, the global loss of species and biodiversity poses an enormous threat. That is why we want to accelerate the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Convention on Biological Diversity
in Europe and worldwide. We are increasing European engagement with the countries most affected by biodiversity loss and supporting the protection of land while respecting the rights of indigenous peoples. Our goal is to put Europe's and the world's biodiversity on the road to recovery.
Making Global Gateway a success
In many parts of the world, there is a huge need for investment in order to achieve growth and prosperity with good mobility and digital participation. This must happen under the conditions of climate neutrality, climate adaptation and social justice. So far, the Chinese "New Silk Road" program, which creates financial dependencies and systematically uses them as political leverage, has been the main response to the need for investment. As an alternative to this, we want to turn the European Global Gateway Strategy into a successful geostrategic project that supports partner countries in sustainably improving their living and economic conditions. In this way, we are making a strong European contribution to the G7 infrastructure partnership and, by complying with high human rights, social and environmental standards, we are helping to strengthen the global economy.
international standards of the G20 for infrastructure planning.
Through targeted investments in socio-ecological modernization in our partner countries, we want to create climate-friendly prosperity, strengthen the protection of human rights, diversify supply chains and promote accessible digital infrastructures and the production of green energy in our neighbourhood. In doing so, we want to reduce dependencies by strengthening sustainable value creation in partner countries and combining this with investments in social infrastructure that are in line with local development agendas.
However, Global Gateway can only be a success if the EU provides the program with substantial funds that, in conjunction with the leveraged private capital, can provide the necessary resources. In order to improve the visibility and connectivity of the program globally and within the EU, we also want to appoint aspecial envoy for it.
The EU must set clear strategic priorities for Global Gateway and develop all projects on the basis of equal cooperation with the partner countries and with the involvement of local civil society. For us, the benchmarks here are human rights, the UN's 2030 Agenda and compliance with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Kunming- Montreal Biodiversity Agreement. For example, mobility infrastructure means prioritizing investment in climate-friendly modes of transport such as rail, and energy generated must always be made available to the producing countries on site first. In addition, the EU Commission must ensure policy coherence for sustainable development and greater transparency in the selection of structural policy projects and in their implementation and evaluation. In order to make Global Gateway a success, development policy expertise must be used during implementation and the principles of development policy effectiveness must be implemented.
Strengthening international organizations
The UN and its organizations remain the foundation of multilateralism. In the case of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the international community in the
The UN General Assembly proved that it is very capable of acting when an overwhelming majority repeatedly and clearly condemned this brutal war of aggression. However, it is clear that the situation in the Security Council makes it difficult for the UN to take peacekeeping measures.
Regional organizations such as the EU therefore have a key role to play in crisis management, including with their own missions. The EU and its member states make more than half of all contributions to multilateral organizations such as the UN system. In the upcoming reform discussions, we want to make the UN and its organizations fit for the future through a coordinated EU approach. This includes reforming the Security Council, in which we want to ensure fairer representation of the world's regions. In addition, we aim to abolish the right of veto and support mechanisms such as the option adopted in UN General Assembly Resolution 377 "Uniting for Peace" to deal with the matter in the event of a persistent blockade and to adopt recommendations - i.e. diplomatic measures, sanctions or military measures in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter - by a qualified majority.
The G7 and G20 are also proving to be additional forums for tackling global challenges, in addition to our involvement in the UN. We therefore support the G7's efforts to work more closely with partner countries around the world and, in particular, with the UN.
in the Global South, and expressly support the permanent membership of the African Union as part of the G20.
In order to be able to respond to the global and development challenges of our time, the EU must advocate comprehensive renewal, democratization
- including greater participation of actors from the Global South - and sufficient funding.
capacity of the international financial institutions. The World Bank has already begun this reform process with its "Evolution Roadmap" and must now continue it with determination. It is crucial that goals such as reducing inequality and protecting planetary boundaries are systematically taken into account and operationalized through indicators. UN specialized agencies such as the refugee agency UNHCR or the health organization WHO provide vital support to help people in need. The EU must therefore continue to support and strengthen these organizations. Corresponding funds should be provided as flexibly as possible.
We also advocate an active, fair personnel policy for the EU when filling positions in international organizations such as the International Standardiza- tion Organization (ISO) or the World Bank Group.
Defending human rights worldwide
Opposition activists are being persecuted in many places around the world, the scope of action of civil society and independent media is being restricted and protests are being crushed. Regardless of this, Wherever people live, they have the right to demand and receive help to protect and promote their basic human rights. We stand up for democracy and human rights and strengthen independent media, non-violent pro-democracy movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights defenders in both the analogue and digital space.
We want to expand funding opportunities and financially stabilize the corresponding protection instruments and institutions, such as special rapporteurs and the European Democracy Fund, and make them more accessible and sustainable. This should also create spaces for exchange and networking between civil society organizations, pro-democratic
movements, independent media and individual activists should be created and strengthened.
The protection and promotion of democracy will be more effective if we pool our efforts and coordinate them at European level.
The protection of human rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the state.
Cooperation with democracies worldwide has a special role to play in promoting freedom and self- determination. We want to actively support and strengthen states that have embarked on the path to democracy in this process. In line with the EU's Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, we support the imposition of targeted sanctions against state and non-state actors responsible for or involved in serious human rights violations and abuses. The EU and its member states must take decisive action against violations of sanctions and also hold international partners to account. In addition, we want to examine the extent to which abandoned assets can be used to make reparations to victims in a legally secure manner.
Human rights defenders risk a lot. They need our protection, our solidarity and our active support. We want to consistently implement the EU guidelines for the protection of human rights defenders. A gender-specific perspective is important here, as women and marginalized groups, such as defenders of indigenous rights, are exposed to a higher risk of violence. We want to offer vulnerable human rights defenders and their families protection in the EU with faster and simplified visa issuance. We are committed to ensuring that the EU's diplomatic missions abroad stand up for human rights defenders. This includes, for example, monitoring the court proceedings of political prisoners, creating international visibility, providing immediate assistance and holding regular exchanges/meetings. This also applies to those who defend the right to conscientious objection.
As part of our support for human rights defenders,
we are committed to providing EU missions abroad with more training in conflict-sensitive democracy promotion and human rights protection.
Following the example of the Canadian resettlement program, we advocate a European protection program for human rights defenders.
This enables them to receive protection quickly and unbureaucratically and to continue their work in a safe environment. Attacks on human rights defenders are increasingly taking place in the digital space. In order to protect them, we support secure, encrypted communication options and the right to use the internet anonymously and are campaigning against the further fragmentation of the internet and internet shutdowns.
Investigative journalists and whistleblowers like Julian Assange also need special protection. They bring crimes and societal abuses to light. Their protection is an essential part of press freedom, which must be urgently defended both internally and externally.
Implementing foreign and development policy in a feminist way
Equality makes societies more peaceful, just, sustainable, resilient and economically successful. It is an integral part of universal human rights.
Structural injustices mean that certain groups, especially women and marginalized groups, are particularly affected by violence, poverty and war, but also by the consequences of the climate crisis. At the same time, there are often only a few of them at the table when it comes to finding solutions to these crises. With UN Resolution 1325 and its follow-up resolutions, the protection of women and girls in war zones and their participation in conflict prevention and resolution is already anchored internationally. We want to go further. We are committed to a feminist foreign and development policy that strengthens the rights, resources and representation of women, girls and marginalized groups in all areas worldwide.
Based on human rights, it has the overcoming
of all forms of discrimination. In this context, particular attention is paid to multiple forms of discrimination. Building on the Federal Government's guidelines, we want to anchor feminist foreign and development policy as a guiding principle of the EU's external relations and international cooperation.
We are committed to equal representation of women in the EU's foreign policy institutions and to significantly increasing the proportion of women at all levels of Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) missions - especially at management level. The perspectives of women and girls should be included in all EU international negotiations. We want to strengthen the capacities for gender and diversity in EU diplomacy and significantly increase the participation of women and marginalized groups in relevant delegations.
We call for the EU to become a global pioneer in the fight against sexualized and gender-based violence in its external relations. Because misogyny, queer and trans hostility is a security threat for many people. Following the EU's accession to the Istanbul Convention, we are calling for its consistent implementation by the EU member states. We also call for the global implementation of the Yogyakarta Principles against discrimination and for the protection of the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, inter* and queer people (LGBTIQ*).
We want the EU to align its development policy with the principles of feminist development cooperation in a partner-oriented and sustainable way, and to make existing practices more sustainable.
critically evaluated. It must achieve its self- imposed goal of ensuring that 85% of EU development programs also contribute to gender equality by 2025. To this end, the EU should structurally provide more funds to promote women and marginalized groups, for example through cooperation with feminist civil society actors or support in the areas of basic education and vocational training, entrepreneurship and sexual and reproductive health. In accordance with the EU Action Plan for Gender Equality, we want to systematically anchor gender- transformative and intersectional approaches in our development policy activities.
2. 
A European security and defense policy
Defending Europe together
Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, has clearly shown us that we must be able to effectively deter potential aggressors from attacking us and defend our way of life militarily in an extreme emergency. The future of alliance defense and collective response capability lies in the European and transatlantic integration and interoperability of our armed forces.
The closer we work together in the EU on security and defense policy, the better, more cost- efficiently and more effectively we can ensure Europe's defense capability, especially as part of the transatlantic alliance (NATO). The EU's strategic compass and its integration into NATO's strategic concept are key to this. We stand by our alliance commitments within the framework of the EU and NATO and the capabilities and capacities required for this. Based on our historical responsibility and the lessons learned from the Russian war of aggression, we are committed to protecting the Baltic states, including through military cooperation as part of a long-term deployment of Bundeswehr units in the Baltic states.
We therefore want to continue working on a common European security and defense union with strong parliamentary participation and control. We want to expand increased cooperation between the armed forces, for example within permanent EU units or transnational units such as the German-Dutch Corps. This requires common framework standards and working conditions for soldiers as well as the creation of the basis for a uniform EU duty of care towards deployed forces and civilian personnel. We want the common
EU command structure and European military cooperation initiatives, for example in the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO).
We are strengthening civilian and military missions within the framework of the CSDP and their planning staff in terms of funding and personnel.
These missions must always be embedded in an overall political concept, be subject to continuous risk analysis, take into account the actual needs on the ground and be oriented towards the guiding principle of human security. For civilian CSDP missions, we must combine long-term financial frameworks with a more flexible concept so that they can be deployed more quickly and adapt appropriately to changing circumstances. Joint EU missions abroad should be accompanied, monitored and evaluated more closely by the European Parliament. We are consolidating support for Ukraine within the framework of the European Peace Facility (EPF) and strengthening its unit for risk analysis and arms control. The structures of the EPF should be adapted to improve the availability of funds, the predictability of expenditure and parliamentary control in the European Parliament and the member states. We also see the establishment of a European air defense system as a necessary component of a common European security architecture.
In the defense sector, the uncoordinated procurement of EU member states leads to a complex system diversity, a lack of economies of scale and thus the ineffective use of taxpayers' money. Our goal is a joint and thus more cost- effective European development and procurement of armaments. This requires the effective implementation of the annual capability analysis in close coordination and agreement with the NATO planning process on the basis of the same standards and norms, financial incentives for and trust between the member states, but also the political will to set aside industrial policy interests in favor of greater common security. This will enable us to consolidate the European defense sector. The European Defense
Agency (EDA) has not yet achieved this to a sufficient extent. We share the objectives of existing financial instruments such as the European Defense Fund (EDF) or joint procurement (EDIRPA). However, these instruments are inadequate, legally fragile and parliamentary control is severely limited.
That is why we want to create a legally secure extra-budgetary financial instrument in the medium term to replace the existing individual programs and cover the entire military capability cycle - from industrial research and development to procurement, maintenance and training. The expenditure of this pot
must be subject to strict and coordinated control by the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
European regulation of arms exports
The joint development, procurement and use of European weapons systems creates greater security and efficiency. And thus also contributes to a common value-based security and defense policy. These joint EU projects require uniform and restrictive European export regulations. To this end, we want to adopt an arms export control regulation based on the EU's common position, which creates transparency and clarity and is based on European values and a common assessment of the security situation. There must be clear
decision-making mechanisms and sanctions that are enforceable before the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Prior risk analyses as well as binding and physical end-use controls must be prescribed and consistently implemented. European weapons must no longer be allowed to end up in the hands of regimes that systematically violate human rights or use them for crimes of aggression. We advocate a ban on the export of surveillance technologies to repressive regimes and a comprehensive ban on the export of small arms to third countries.
Disarmament, arms control and the non- proliferation of weapons are and will remain essential pillars of any peace policy. They mean greater global security for all. The goal of our efforts remains a peaceful world free of nuclear weapons. Even in uncertain times, we therefore want to strengthen arms control, promote confidence-building measures and advance bilateral and multilateral disarmament initiatives. The EU should therefore work to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a central pillar of nuclear arms control. In addition, the EU should encourage its member states to constructively support the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, to participate as observers in the Conference of the States Parties and to commit to the Global Zero vision. These are the first steps on the way to successive joint accession and a world free of nuclear weapons. We support efforts under international law to regulate lethal autonomous weapons systems. There must be no use of weapons systems that make the human factor technically dispensable in life and death decisions. We condemn any use of armed drones in violation of international law, even if it is carried out by our allies. We reject the use of cluster bombs, including in Ukraine. We also want to work with the EU worldwide to dissuade non-parties from using cluster munitions in accordance with the Oslo Convention.
Preventing crises
We are committed to a forward-looking foreign and security policy that recognizes conflicts at an early stage and counters them. Cooperation between policy areas and coherence are key to this.
of approaches is important. We want to make comprehensive use of EU funds for civilian peacebuilding actors.
increase funding. The EU must provide greater support for local civil society concepts and actors in peacebuilding, make funding guidelines more flexible in this context and make it easier to plan the allocation of funds over the long term. We want to strengthen EU funds and approaches for stabilization measures in order to be flexible in crises,
to act in a targeted and effective manner. We want to systematically strengthen the peacekeeping and conflict resolution capabilities of the UN and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as regional organizations such as the African Union. We want to strengthen research into the causes of current conflicts, their progression and their peaceful resolution and promote international networking in peace and conflict research.
The EU must use and expand its strength worldwide as a mediator in conflicts and as an alliance for peace through cooperation. We want to strengthen civilian CSDP missions as an instrument of EU foreign policy with more financial resources and personnel and systematically develop them further, for example to support the police or the judiciary in fragile states. With institutions that are based on the rule of law and close to the people, they can build trust and prevent conflicts. We are opposed to focusing civilian CSDP missions on migration management. Effective civilian crisis prevention, stabilization, humanitarian aid and peacekeeping measures require in-depth context analyses, better coordination and effective evaluations. We want to expand the European Center of Excellence for Civilian Crisis Management in order to better network member states in their civilian crisis prevention and crisis management measures.
Through a policy of prevention, we are also making an important contribution to combating the causes of displacement. Established local structures and functioning state institutions that protect human rights and provide services of general interest
reduce the likelihood of conflicts that cause human suffering and force people to leave their homes.
With humanitarian aid, we support people worldwide who are in humanitarian emergencies. We want to strengthen European and international organizations in this area. This includes, in particular, better funding as well as more efficient and flexible structures and allocation guidelines for European organizations.
humanitarian aid organization ECHO. We also want to improve the coordination of national European aid. Finally, we want to oblige European emergency aid organizations to pay more attention to gender-specific needs and the needs of marginalized groups.
3. Global justice
Being a reliable partner
At the heart of our development policy commitment are the people we want to support in their quest for better living conditions on the ground. We therefore stand for human rights- based cooperation with countries in the Global South. China's development initiatives often aim to create one-sided dependencies. In its war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, Russia has shown that it is prepared to use hunger as a weapon. Rising prices for food, energy and transport have exacerbated hunger and economic crises, destabilized countries and brought hardship to people around the world. We want the EU to actively compete for partnerships with the Global South and to intensify the coordinated approach it has begun with the member states to build fair partnerships. We are committed to partner-oriented, feminist, decolonial and sustainable approaches in development cooperation that effectively address systemic injustices.
to dismantle in a targeted manner. In doing so, we also want to
do justice to our colonial past and critically question colonial continuities.
We want to promote local knowledge and local initiatives in order to support the development of economic cycles and social security systems. To this end, we want to further develop the existing instruments of European development cooperation in dialog with our partners. To this end, the EU must strengthen local and civil society actors in universities and NGOs and make funding guidelines more flexible. Collaboration with the private sector, including
Start-ups are part of this. We are committed to ensuring that civil society and, in particular, women's rights organizations from countries in the Global South receive direct support from the EU, following the example of the Canadian Equality Fund. We also want to strengthen global city partnerships that bring issues of global justice into the living spaces of local people and make an important contribution to municipal development cooperation.
In view of the global challenges, substantial funds are needed for development cooperation. We are committed to ensuring that all EU member states keeptheir promise to spend at least 0.7 percent of gross national income on development financing (ODA quota). However, it is not only the quantity of support that is important, but also the implementation of projects in a partner-oriented, fast, unbureaucratic and impact-oriented manner. The development funds must primarily go to the countries most in need and contribute to the fulfillment of the sustainable development goals as well as the Paris Climate Agreement and the Montreal Biodiversity Agreement. In cooperation with our partner countries, we also want to strengthen people's social security. We support the development of social security systems as a sustainable instrument against poverty. The reconstruction requirements for Ukraine should be made available in addition to the ODA quota.
All too often, the EU Commission and member states still work side by side in the field of development policy. We therefore support the Team Europe approach, which aims to improve cross-sectoral coordination, coherence, visibility and effectiveness in cooperation with the private sector. In order to increase coherence and transparency, we advocate cross-sector evaluations and a transparency mechanism for public development cooperation in the EU. We want to better involve the European Parliament in development policy decision-making processes.
In the area of digital development collaboration, we want to create human-centered and responsible
We want to shape responsible digitalization globally and promote digital self-determination. We want to strengthen digital policy exchange, because
As the EU, we can learn a lot from digital pioneers in countries of the Global South. We want to expand adequacy decisions with our partner countries and thus promote participation in international digital value creation.
Securing food globally
The multiple crises of our time, above all the climate crisis, pose existential challenges for food security worldwide. The EU must work towards a sustainable and resilient global food system and thus contribute to the implementation of the right to food.
A resilient and productive organic agriculture with strong regional markets, but also access to supra- regional markets, is the best way to make agriculture more resilient to political crises and the consequences of climate change. European development cooperation projects should increasingly promote economically viable and ecologically and socially sustainable farming systems with nutrient cycles that are as closed as possible. We are committed to ensuring that European agricultural subsidies, patented seeds and land grabbing do not undermine farming structures and markets in countries of the Global South and create one-sided, expensive dependencies. Respect for the individual development opportunities of the countries and the self-determination of the people has the highest priority for us. We want the
Promote the establishment and expansion of local
seed banks and breeding infrastructure so that traditional knowledge and biodiversity are preserved and remain accessible and dependencies in seed development are reduced. We want to advocate stricter mechanisms within the EU to prevent excessive food speculation, especially in emergency situations. Speculation in water must also be strictly regulated. We want to prevent water scarcity from being exacerbated by speculation in addition to increasing droughts and rising water prices.
We want to end exports of synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which are banned in the EU.
The promotion of agriculture based on agroecological principles in countries of the Global South must be implemented as part of comprehensive strategies to strengthen food systems, including access to technologies, infrastructures, markets and financial resources as well as mutual knowledge transfer. The role of women and marginalized groups in nutrition and food production must also be taken into account.
Accepting global responsibility
The legacy of the colonial era still weighs heavily on relations between Europe and former colonies. It can be seen, for example, in the unequal global distribution of wealth, economic dependencies and a lack of representation. The member states of the EU must face up to their historical responsibility resulting from the crimes of colonial history and address power imbalances. This requires an anti- racist perspective and an examination of post- colonial continuities.
We will work to ensure thatthe debate on the recognition of human rights violations, war crimes and the appropriation and destruction of cultural heritage committed by EU member states during their colonial era in countries of the Global South is also conducted at EU level. We want to find a common way to apologize appropriately, to take responsibility with words and deeds and to make idealistic and material reparations within a framework of international law.
We want to correct disadvantageous clauses in trade agreements and drive forward reforms at development banks. We want to better respect the human and land rights of indigenous and local communities in international nature and environmental protection agreements. The euro
We want to continuously evaluate and further develop European development cooperation in cooperation with partner countries and civil society in the sense of a critical reflection of power relations.
Many countries in the Global South are in a debt crisis that massively restricts their options for socio-ecological modernization processes. The EU and its member states must advocate solid debt restructuring and debt relief for particularly burdened countries. To this end, debt restructuring must be further developed under the G20 Common Framework in order to make it more transparent and include all private and public creditors in a binding manner. In the long term, this procedure must be established at the UN. We want to prevent European jurisdictions from being misused for money laundering or tax avoidance, which the
further restrict the financial scope of action of countries in the Global South. We are also committed to reforming the global tax architecture and involving the Global South as partners in order to promote global justice and sustainability. This includes promoting inclusive, fair and effective international tax cooperation at UN level, for example through negotiations on a comprehensive UN tax convention.
4. Fair trade
Creating prosperity with trade
Trade promotes exchange between people and societies and can increase prosperity. This has been demonstrated by the EU itself, of which the single market remains a key pillar to this day.
In Germany in particular, our prosperity depends on well-functioning global trade due to the strong export orientation of our economy. It is therefore a political task for the EU to use its economic and political influence to set global standards for social justice, climate and nature protection as well as human rights through trade policy and to ensure that the EU's trade policy is in line with these standards.
to promote value creation. In this way, we also protect our own standards from undercutting competition and thus act in line with our values and interests.
The crises of recent years - the pandemic, extreme weather and war - have shown that we need to reduce risks in supply chains and access to raw materials. A forward-looking, open trade policy that establishes reliable partnerships makes an important contribution to this. To this end, we must support European companies in diversifying their investment activities and value chains.
Realigning trading instruments
Global trade needs global rules. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the best possible framework for formulating and reviewing these rules and settling any disputes. We want to fundamentally reform the WTO so that it can once again fulfill this role. Good labor standards, access to health products and green technologies, fair development as well as climate, environmental and animal protection must also be placed at the center of global trade policy.
However, the WTO is currently barely able to act due to the tense geopolitical situation and there is little willingness to reform it globally. We are therefore increasingly focusing on regional trade agreements on an equal footing with partners such as Australia, India, the countries of Latin America and the Southeast Asian community of states ASEAN, which are also committed to rules-based global trade. We advocate high environmental and social standards worldwide, also in order to level the global playing field.
We are therefore committed to ensuring that sustainability goals and human rights are included in all future international trade agreements and are enforceable, as in the recently concluded agreement between the EU and New Zealand. In the event of blatant disregard for human rights or violations of the
Paris Climate Agreement, the EU should make consistent use of these clauses or suspend the agreement.
We want to realign the Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), not least in consultation with civil society actors. In this way, we will support the transfer of climate-friendly technologies and important health technologies from the Global North to the South in order to promote the development of the local economy and reduce global emissions. We also want to break down barriers to innovation and its market penetration, particularly in areas that are geared towards the common good and areas of public welfare. To this end, we want to examine the further development of European patent law, for example.
Digitalization can significantly simplify globally fair trade, for example by automating the monitoring of supply chains. Digital trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights, data protection and net neutrality must always be considered in the EU's trade agreements and trade instruments. This requires a revision of European trade instruments in the areas of data regulations and data localization,
Research and development, national tax systems and the digital single market.
We also want to improve the democratic control of trade agreements. Before negotiations begin, the European Parliament should determine the negotiating mandate together with the Council of the EU.
If EU industries are harmed by unfair trade practices, EU trade defense instruments must provide an effective response to protect fair competition.
Conversely, we want to offer less industrialized countries in particular an open dialogue and give them a fair chance in trade agreements to pursue an industrial policy with the aim of creating their own value. In this area, we have made significant progress by constantly expanding our trade
political toolbox has already achieved a great deal. For example, through the instrument against coercive measures (anti-coercion instrument), with which the EU can defend itself against unilateral coercive measures by trading partners.
We are committed to transparent and publicly legitimized forms of dispute resolution in free trade agreements, where these are necessary.
Acting in harmony with the climate
We want to transform our economy into a climate- neutral one and develop it into a strong circular economy. This includes developing standards together with our trading partners so that global markets for green products such as climate- neutral steel can emerge.
The introduction of the border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) is an important step towards introducing fair carbon pricing in global trade and supplementing and safeguarding the EU emissions trading system. This will make imports of certain products such as steel or cement from countries without emissions trading more expensive if they are produced using climate-damaging processes. The CBAM thus also supports the modernizatio
The European Green Deal is an important step in the development of our industry, for example by protecting producers of green steel from non- European competition from fossil-based steel and ensuring fair competition.
It is important that we end investments in fossil fuels and other climate-damaging activities and instead incentivize sustainable investments. This requires a fundamental change in the model for bilateral EU investment treaties. The withdrawal from the most climate-damaging investment protection treaty in the world - the Energy Charter Treaty - by Germany and other EU countries is a great success. We are now consistently fighting for the entire EU to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty.
The law on deforestation-free supply chains is an important building block in the goal of combating grave deforestation rates worldwide. To ensure that the law has the desired effect
the EU must now seek partnerships with producer countries and support them in building sustainable supply chains and complying with the requirements. We want to particularly promote the import of products from agroforestry systems in tropical forests.
Focus on fair partnerships
As a global economic player, the EU must place human rights and social justice at the center of a future-oriented trade policy. Ambitious European laws to regulate supply chains and their national implementation are an important lever for achieving these goals and covering not only the direct suppliers, but the entire supply chain.
We are also transposing the new European Supply Chain Directive into national law and adapting national requirements where necessary. We enable injured parties in the EU to assert their rights. In this way, the EU and its member states are taking responsibility for effectively curbing social and environmental dumping worldwide.
Ratification and implementation of the core labor standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO) should be considered a minimum requirement for any trade agreement. Trade agreements must also take into account the concerns of indigenous peoples and communities on the ground and protect their rights.
There are currently more than 25 million forced laborers in the world. Products from this modern form of slavery have no place on the EU domestic market. The EU ban on imports of products from forced labor must therefore be implemented consistently. We want to focus on all forms of forced labor, including in the digital space.
We must ensure fair economic relations with countries of the Global South. We want to review the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the South Pacific in the interests of fair and development-oriented trade. This includes recognizing the special advantages of the Least Developed
countries that allow these countries to import goods into the EU duty-free, also as part of EPAs, and to enable the countries of the Global South to pursue an active industrial policy. In order to support countries in the Global South in reducing their export dependency on unprocessed raw materials, we want to design European and international free trade instruments in such a way thatthey do not prevent the development of local industries and integration into higher value-added chains.
5. More EU in Europe
Prospects for expansion
The enlargement of the EU is a success story and is in our own best interests. It strengthens our security, our stability and our prosperity. That is why it is our responsibility to actively support countries with a European perspective. We want to combine clear criteria for accession with binding offers of cooperation in a fair accession process. In order for an enlarged EU to remain capable of acting, it must reform its structures: Enlargement and reforms must go hand in hand.
All candidate states must fulfill the Copenhagen criteria, the EU's accession criteria, without any exceptions and fully adopt the EU's common law, the acquis.
By advancing EU enlargement step by step, we are dynamizing the lengthy and often cumbersome accession process and securing the credibility of the European project.
It must become more visible: The pace of reform in the accession countries alone determines the pace of accession. National vetoes by EU member states in the opening of chapters should not be allowed.
Accession process must not be blocked. We want to shape the accession process with visible intermediate steps and recognize these with positive incentives, for example access to roaming, Erasmus+ or parts of the internal market. A standstill in the negotiations for a longer period of time
Any delay or even regression should, conversely, lead to a loss of benefits. One focus in the accession process must be on strengthening the rule of law and democracy as well as the fight against corruption and organized crime. To this end, we want to extend the mandates of the
EU anti-corruption authority OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor's Office to the accession countries and the EU funds they use.
Strengthening civil society in the accession states and networking them with each other and with the EU member states is also key for us. On the road to the EU, close cooperation with all democratic forces in the accession countries is important to us, even beyond the governments. Government representatives from the accession countries should be able to participate in selected meetings of the Council of the EU. We expect all accession candidates to fully align with the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the adoption of sanctions against Russia.
Western Balkans
The future of the six Western Balkan states of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia lies in the EU.
The promise of EU accession continues to be an important driver for the sensitive peace and reconciliation process in the countries of the Western Balkans. The EU must not jeopardize this promise of accession. The start of accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia, candidate status for Bosnia and Herzegovina and visa liberalization for Kosovo are important steps forward on the road to the EU.
At the same time, the challenges remain great in view of corruption, organized crime, weak rule of law structures and the inadequate processing of war crimes in some cases. We want to provide the countries in the accession process with intensive support in overcoming these challenges. The EU must counter attempts by authoritarian states to destabilize the region with determination and resolve.
We are united in our opposition. We support democratic development and coming to terms with the past in Bosnia and Herzegovina and welcome the presence of EUFOR to strengthen security in the country. We call on the Serbian government to take a public stand against violence and for peaceful understanding and call on Serbia and Kosovo to reach a lasting solution at the negotiating table. This is a prerequisite for peace and stability in the region and a key to Serbia's EU accession process. We are strengthening KFOR to support the peace process. We want to provide even better support for the region's civil societies, in particular strengthen cross-border youth work in the region and support an inclusive culture of remembrance. As part of the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans, we want to support the region quickly and effectively in developing good jobs, renewable energies, modern rail infrastructure and sustainable investments.
Ukraine
Ukraine is at the center of the European family. Its place is in the EU. Every day, millions of Ukrainians courageously oppose Russia's war of aggression, which violates international law: they are resisting Russia's brutal attempt to subjugate their country and eradicate their culture, to destroy international law and the European peace order.
We are committed to ensuring that the EU does not let up in its humanitarian, political, financial and military support for Ukraine. We will continue to resolutely support Ukraine so that it can regain and defend its sovereignty and full territorial integrity. We stand firmly by Ukraine, its people and their right to freedom, self-determination and self-defense and support the desire for a sustainable peace and robust, reliable security guarantees.
We will also provide Ukraine with comprehensive support on its path to the EU. Both sides will benefit from an orderly and swift
accession process. We are focusing on transparency, the rule of law, a consistent fight against corruption and an active role for civil society and the regional and municipal level. We are already seeing great progress in the reforms necessary for the EU accession negotiations. The people of Ukraine deserve our recognition for changing their country so fundamentally in the midst of a war.
We are committed to ensuring that the EU and its member states provide financial, technical and investment support for the reconstruction of Ukraine. This also requires major financial efforts, the involvement of Ukrainian civil society and significantly accelerated procedures in order to achieve rapid results and strengthen the country against Russian attacks. We are committed to long- term and sustainable financing for the reconstruction of Ukraine. In addition to various state and private financial instruments, this requires grants in particular. We want to examine whether and how abandoned Russian assets can be used for the reconstruction of Ukraine in a legally secure manner.
We rely on a variety of international investigative and judicial bodies to investigate and punish Russian crimes against humanity and war crimes, including the crime of aggressive war. An international mechanism should decide on the compensation of property damage and personal injury caused by Russia to Ukraine and thus create a legal basis for Russia to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine.
Ukraine's economy has been severely weakened by the war. We would like the EU to further stabilize Ukraine's economy through macro- financial assistance and to continue this as a sign of solidarity and as a contribution to European security. This also includes pushing ahead with the expansion of alternative export routes for Ukrainian agricultural products beyond the Black Sea (solidarity lanes). This will help Ukraine economically and contribute to global food security.
Georgia and Moldova
The future of Moldova and Georgia lies in the EU. Both countries have long been the target of military aggression and attempts at destabilization by Russia. These have intensified since the beginning of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. We stand resolutely by the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries. We will actively support Moldova and Georgia on their path to the EU, but at the same time demand the necessary reforms. Ins-
As an EU accession candidate and since 2020, Moldova in particular has embarked on a courageous and ambitious reform course, which we consistently support. The Georgian people's desire for EU integration remains huge; the government must now implement the necessary reforms to fulfill the country's European dream.
European Neighborhood
The European family is bigger than the EU. We want an EU thatworks constructively with its European neighbors.
We would like to intensify the EU's cooperation with the Council of Europe in the promotion and defense of democracy and human rights on the European continent. To this end, we are also working towards the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights.
We welcome the European Political Community as a platform for closer cooperation with European countries, regardless of whether they are seeking EU membership or not. In the field of energy in particular, this cooperation is in the strong European interest.
We want the EU and the UK to continue to work constructively to intensify their relations again after Brexit. Close economic and military cooperation between the EU and the UK is in our mutual interest. We welcome the fact that the United Kingdom has rejoined the
EU research program Horizon Europe. At the same time, we expect the British government to remove practical hurdles to exchange and cooperation with the EU, such as student visas, as quickly as possible.
In view of the challenges posed by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, we want to preserve the OSCE as an important forum for dialog and crisis prevention. It can play a central role in shaping the post-war order in Eastern Europe.
Turkey
Turkey and the EU - and Germany in particular - have a long-standing friendship and partnership that is reflected in close social, cultural and economic relations. We believe that a democratic Turkey, in which the rights of all its citizens are respected, has a firm place in the EU.
Unfortunately, the current political reality is different: In recent years, the Turkish government has moved further and further away from the rule of law and human rights. With an aggressive foreign and regional policy, Ankara is in some cases aggressively targeting European interests.
The initial blockade of Sweden's accession to NATO and the military offensive in northern Syria, which violates international law, also show what a difficult partner Turkey is for Europe and NATO in the current security situation. At the same time, it has acted as a mediator in the war against Ukraine and beyond.
Despite this ambivalent role, Turkey remains a strategic partner within NATO, for Europe and for Germany. An active Green foreign policy faces up to this dilemma. For us, there can only be a resumption of talks on EU accession once Turkey has credibly embarked on the path to democracy and the rule of law.
We support cooperation inthose areas where it is necessary and possible,
for example on security in the Black Sea or in the fight against climate change. However, we firmly oppose authoritarian policies and nationalist rhetoric that are openly directed against the EU, against the safety of Turkish opposition members in the EU, against refugees, against Kurds and other minorities or against human rights defenders in our own country.
The Turkish government must release the countless political prisoners, including Osman Kavala and Selahattin Demirtas, and comply with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). With
Turkey's disregard for the judgments of the ECtHR makes the ongoing infringement proceedings within the Council of Europe unavoidable.
Disregarding court rulings creates legal uncertainty, which also puts a strain on civil society and economic relations with Turkey.
We continue to stand firmly by the side of the many Turks whoarecommitted to democracy and the rule of law. We would like the EU to give special support to Turkish civil society, which is committed to democratic change.
6. A strong Europe in the world
Eastern neighbors of the EU
Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is a turning point for the EU and our continent. The EU is called upon to find new answers to its neighborly relationship with a hostile Russia. For our Eastern European partners in the EU, we need targeted measures for a new EU policy for Eastern Europe and Central Asia that take particular account of the changed security interests of our partners. At the same time, we must provide special support to the democratic reform forces and civil societies in Russia's European neighbors that are threatened by Russian interference.
We stand firmly by the courageous people in Belarus who have been working tirelessly for democracy and human rights in their country since the protests surrounding the fraudulent presidential elections in 2020. We will continue to stand in solidarity with and strongly advocate for the support of Belarusian civil society and opposition, the release of all political prisoners, the sanctioning of the Belarusian regime and free and fair elections in the country.
Dictator Lukashenka and his regime are guilty of serious human rights violations and war crimes in Belarus and by supporting the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. They must be held accountable for this. We are committed to
in particular for the EU to support the collection and preservation of evidence.
The EU can and should become more involved in all countries of the South Caucasus and actively support existing democracy movements and civil society. Armenia's path to greater political participation and freedoms was paved by Russian pressure and the war over mountain ranges. karabakh massively more difficult. Azerbaijan has decided to use military force to establish facts
to create. We condemn Baku's military attack on Nagorno-Karabakh in September 2023. The EU must show the autocratic Azerbaijani government clear limits in the event of further offensives. Long- term peace can only be achieved through negotiations. We therefore welcome the EU's efforts to find a sustainable peace solution with Armenia and Azerbaijan. The EU Monitoring Mission in Armenia (EUMA) is making an important stabilizing contribution in this regard. Over 100,000 Armenians have been forced to leave Nagorno- Karabakh.
half of them children and elderly people. The EU should support the integration of refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh in Armenia or enable their return to Nagorno-Karabakh through international protection mechanisms. The protection of Armenian culture and Christian religion in Nagorno-Karabakh must be ensured in order to protect the region's common heritage. The EU should act between
Armenia and Azerbaijan should act as a stabilizing mediator and at the same time strengthen Armenia's democratic reform forces. This should also include the EU supporting Armenia in driving forward the democratic reform process despite all the challenges and strengthening the country's independence from Russia. This requires an even closer partnership and rapprochement between Armenia and the EU, as well as with Germany.
Putin and his regime of power have turned Russia into a totalitarian dictatorship. Security in Europe can currently only exist before Russia
- and not with Russia. Violence, lies, corruption and arbitrariness characterize the political reality.
Civil society has been silenced and the opposition is either in exile or in political prison. We will continue to campaign for the release of all political prisoners. We see ourselves as friends and partners of those whowant a free, peaceful and democratic Russia. We see ourselves as hard adversary of all those who support Putin's criminal regime. We therefore support the European sanctions policy against the regime and its representatives. There can be no economic and trade policy normality with this Russia.
We welcome the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant against the Russian President. He is guilty of the worst human rights crimes and must be brought to justice with the full force of the law.
Transatlantic relations
There is no other country outside Europe with which we Europeans share such a deep common history and such a strong partnership as with the USA. After the Second World War and the end of the Cold War, the USA made a significant contribution to economic development and political unification on the European continent and to the reunification of Germany.
However, transatlantic relations are also
of central importance for our European present and future. We value Canada and the USA as close and reliable value partners and would like to further deepen the EU's relations with both. Since the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, our transatlantic partners, and above all the USA, have helped to defend the peace order in Europe and secure the political unity of the Euro-Atlantic alliance. The USA is a key strategic partner: for our security, for the climate-friendly renewal of our prosperity and for the self-assertion of liberal democracy.
Together, we are stronger in the systemic confrontation with China, Russia and other authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Together, we can secure and expand global value partnerships and multilateral forums and agreements. Together, we can shape the global trade order and advance the climate-neutral transformation of our industries. And together we can develop future technologies and at the same time actively shape them for the benefit of people and their freedom.
A strong transatlantic relationship requires partners on both sides of the Atlantic who are able and willing to act. That is why more European efforts a r e needed to develop our own security, defense and economic policy capacities. We want to strengthen the European pillar of NATO, including through closer EU-NATO cooperation.
Anti-liberal tendencies on both sides of the Atlantic endanger the foundation of values on which the transatlantic partnership is based. They must be resolutely opposed.
This also means that we must simultaneously intensify and diversify our strategic partnership with the USA. On the one hand, diversification means putting transatlantic relations on a broader footing - by expanding partnerships with federal states, cities, civil society, business and science.
And diversification also means reducing one-sided dependencies and strengthening the EU's ability to act independently.
The joint EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is a suitable forum for developing joint responses to global challenges. We are in favor of deepening economic relations with the USA in order to createa transatlantic market that follows the highest social and ecological standards worldwide in accordance with the "race to the top" principle and acts as a driving force for green transformation worldwide. An important element of this is the joint work on a club for critical raw materials.
China
For us, China is a partner, economic competitor and systemic rival. However, due to China's increasingly aggressive behavior on the global stage, the partnership is increasingly fading into the background. Internally, the Chinese leadership is acting in a more repressive and authoritarian manner; externally, it is now openly pursuing hegemonic and imperial ambitions and is aggressively trying to expand its own global influence. To this end, China is also increasingly using its influence within the BRICS states (initially Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and now also Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates) and its close partnership with Russia.
This contributes to a further widening of the differences between Europe and China. We therefore advocate closer coordination between the member states and the EU as an institution, as well as a structured exchange of information and closer coordination of relations with China, particularly with our transatlantic and Indo-Pacific partners.
The EU must reduce its one-sided economic dependencies on China, for example in raw materials and medicines, much more quickly and support the European economy in remaining competitive in the long term. This cannot be achieved without an ambitious, independent industrial and investment policy. It is crucial that the EU formulates an independent course towards China. On the other hand, we reject those who advocatea complete decoupling from China.
China is the EU's largest trading partner, but only our third largest export market. The trade deficit is growing: imports from China are increasing, while exports to China are decreasing. China is still dependent on technologies from Europe, and the European market is also attractive for Chinese companies. The EU can make better and more confident use of the existing scope for action here, especially in the area of transparency obligations of Chinese companies with regard to labor, social, environmental and safety standards. Critical infrastructure, such as ports, railroads and digital infrastructure, as well as key industries must be protected from Chinese investment in the long term and throughout the EU.
We support the introduction and use of the EU's anti-coercion instrument as well as a coordinated approach to controls on investments in China and export restrictions in the area of sensitive technologies. With joint instruments, the EU can better defend itself against economic blackmail attempts and achieve a deterrent effect.
The massive and systematic human rights violations against Uyghurs in the province of Xinjiang, but also against Tibetans, religious minorities and representatives of civil society, especially democracy activists in Hong Kong, by the Chinese government must be ended. The protection of human rights is the basis of European policy. This also applies to the international supply chains of European companies. Products from forced labor
in China must not be given access to the European market. We therefore also expect China toratify the key core standards of the ILO.
As part of the EU's one-China policy, we support the relevant participation of democratic Taiwan in international organizations. At the same time, we recognize that the risk of escalation in the Taiwan Strait has increased significantly due to t h e increase in military pressure from the People's Republic of China. A change in the status quo in the Taiwan Strait must not take place against Taiwan's will. We regard Taiwan
as a democratic value partner and arecommittedto intensifying economic, cultural, civil, social and political exchange.
We will work together with China wherever possible on key global challenges such as the debt crisis in countries of the Global South, the financing of economic modernization and climate protection and adaptation measures. This also applies to global health protection, the protection of biodiversity and the protection of the world's oceans. In these and other areas, we remain open to cooperation on the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the core principles of the multilateral order.
Middle East and North Africa
The Middle East and North Africa is a region in upheaval and an important neighbor for the EU. The hopes of the revolutionary movements in the region have remained largely unfulfilled, and in recent years authoritarian actors have once again become entrenched in the region. Despite the difficult situation, however, we want to work closely together to promote economic development in the region.
to support development for the benefit of the people. Their desire for a life in dignity and security and more political participation should be at the heart of European Middle East policy.
There is great potential in the expansion of renewable energies. We see cooperation between small and medium-sized companies as a particular opportunity to strengthen structures beyond the often state-dominated large companies in the region.
In its cooperation with civil society, the EU must be a reliable partner for all those who want to create women's and human rights perspectives and promote freedom and self-determination. Due to its history of colonialism and decades of support for authoritarian governments, Europe has a special responsibility here.
We want to shape a migration policy that does not make us vulnerable to blackmail by authoritarian regimes in the region. A political focus on refugee defense in relation to the southern Mediterranean countries supports authoritarian and dysfunctional regimes that themselves create reasons for flight.
The existence and security of Israel as the national home of the Jewish people with equal rights for all its citizens are non-negotiable. The Hamas terror attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023 were a turning point. After these terrible acts, we stand firmly by the side of Israel and its citizens. Like every other state, Israel has the right under international law to defend itself against attacks such as these within the framework of international humanitarian law. Israel's security is part of Germany's reason of state and the guiding principle of our actions. Peace and security require a two-state settlement with the creation of a sovereign, viable and democratic state of Palestine on the basis of the 1967 borders. To this end, the EU should join the forces of the member states for negotiations between the two sides and offer its active and generous support for the realization of peace.
In addition to our u n w a v e r i n g solidarity with Israel, this also requires consistent support for pro-democratic Palestinian voices. This is also a basis for the creation of Palestinian political institutions based on the rule of law. The peace
perspective also includes the Palestinian Authority clearly condemning terror against Israel and taking action against it. We reject the ongoing Israeli settlement construction, plans for annexations contrary to international law and settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank as obstacles to peace. We want to continue to work in solidarity with those forces in Israel and Palestine that are fighting for peace on both sides. sides for democracy and freedom, human and civil rights and peace. As the largest donor, the EU should also promote the development of democratic institutions and democratic education in its development aid for the Palestinian territories in order to counter hate.
and to promote understanding between Israelis, Palestinians and people from the surrounding neighboring states.
In Iran, we stand alongside the feminist protest movement against the Iranian regime.
This is committed to a democratic Iran, fighting for respect for human rights and the self-determination of the population, including the abolition of dress codes such as the forced veil. We want the EU to critically examine the extension of sanctions against those responsible for the regime and the tightening of sanctions on trade and financial relations on an ongoing basis.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard must be listed as a terrorist organization with legal certainty. In addition, the EU must support the democratic opposition in Iran and in the diaspora and quickly take in politically persecuted Iranians. The Islamic Center Hamburg as a coordination point for monitoring the diaspora in Germany must finally be closed, as must representations in other German cities. The regime is trying to use an aggressive foreign policy and
terror financing to destabilize the region. The terrorist financing of the Iranian regime, which is used, among other things, for the declared goal of destroying Israel, must be combated. With Israel's security in mind, the EU must work together with the USA to prevent Iran from going nuclear. Iran must adhere to international nuclear non- proliferation agreements. Iran has continued to massively violate its obligations under the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, nuclear agreement with Iran) since 2019 and has repeatedly turned down the opportunity to return to the JCOA. This is why the proliferation-related measures in the nuclear sector and sanctions must remain in place. We want to learn from the lessons of the JCPoA negotiations.
We want to counteract the arms spiral in the region with a united EU. We support diplomatic efforts to de-escalate in the region. The normalization of relations must not lead to punitive measures.
This can also lead to a lack of humanity, for example in view of the human rights crimes committed by the Assad regime in Syria.
We bear a special responsibility towards Afghanistan as a result of our many years of involvement and the subsequent hasty withdrawal of Western troops.
Above all, we condemn the ousting of women from almost all areas of public life and do not recognize the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan. We are committed to ensuring that the EU continues to p r o v i d e humanitarian aid in view of the dramatic situation in the country and explicitly involves women. Due to their work - for example for the German Armed Forces and international organizations - or their deployment, local forces and human rights defenders are
for human rights in danger. We therefore stand for the consistent protection and reception of local forces and human rights defenders and their threatened families.
Africa
African countries and Europe are closely linked both geographically and historically. We want to support the diverse countries and societies on the African continent in their efforts to create sustainable development and good jobs locally.
We see growing cooperation between the EU and the African continent in politics, business, technology, science and civil society as an opportunity for both sides.
We want to work togetherwith our African partners for mutual benefit and make attractive European offers for sustainable development.
We see the strengthening of democracy as an important task and condemn unconstitutional changes of power, coups and unfree elections that jeopardize democratic development in some African countries.
The European Climate, Energy and Hydrogen Partnerships and the Climate and Development Partnerships are a good example of how they can help to make industry climate-neutral on both continents. We therefore want to expand them. In doing so, it is clear to us that the energy generated and the associated value
The benefits of the value chain must always be available to the producing countries first, especially the poorest and most marginalized people.
The planned cooperation within the framework of the Global Gateway Initiative is a step towards the further sustainable development of both continents and, as an attractive European offer for the major investment needs, contributes to reducing dependence on China and Russia. We want to support regional integration in the African Economic Communities and the African Union, including the emerging pan-African free trade area.
Good governance and the rule of law are indispensable foundations for social and economic development. We want to support civil society and democratic political actors, especially where state structures are weakened or autocratic structures prevail. In the EU, we want to actively support the non-violent commitment of young people in particular to a pluralistic civil society in their countries and to civil conflict resolution. Women and marginalized groups have a special role to play here.
We are committed to ensuring that third-country nationals who are studying in Europe, traveling on business or attendingconferences, for example, have easier and faster access to visas. One contribution to this is the digitalization of visa procedures.
Europe's integration with Africa is still characterized by an imbalance of power.
In addition, the African continent is already suffering particularly badly from the consequences of the climate crisis, which was caused to a significant extent by European emissions. Conscious of our colonial heritage and the associated economic exploitation, we want to shape relationships thatare based on respect and equality.
Indo-Pacific
The economic center of gravity has shifted to the Indo-Pacific region. This is where a large part of global growth, innovation and development takes place.
We want to expand our close cooperation with Europe's key partners such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand and intensify our exchange with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its member states as well as the oceanic island states. We also want to focus on more cooperation on climate protection and economic modernization and at the same time strengthen cultural exchange, civil society actors and the protection of human rights. In particular, we want to further intensify cooperation with Japan as our closest partner in the Indo-Pacific region and the only member of the G7 in the region. One example of this is the digital partnership that the EU concluded with Japan in May 2022 as its first ever partner country.
In the Indo-Pacific in particular, China is becoming increasingly aggressive and at the same time propagating its authoritarian state and social model as a role model. That is why we also want to expand cooperation between the EU and Indo- Pacific states in the area of security and defense policy.
There are many countries in the Pacific region whose existence is threatened by the climate crisis, even though they themselves have contributed little to global emissions. We want to provide them with concrete and financial support in dealing with the consequences of global warming and rising sea levels. We want to anchor climate protection more firmly in trade relations with the countries of the entire region and jointly promote the production of green energy in the region, for example through the EU's Global Gateway Initiative.
We aim to deepen and broaden the EU's relations with India. We welcome the launch of the EU-India Trade and Technology Council in 2023 as well as the
Connectivity partnership. We recognize India's new importance for the provision of global digital goods and want to explore increased cooperation on digital payment systems. Economic cooperation must be based on clear social, minority and climate protection standards. We are increasingly concerned about current domestic political developments in this regard. We support Indian civil society and are committed t o the peaceful resolution of territorial conflicts in border regions.
The EU member states should work within the UN to condemn behavior by the military regime in Myanmar that violates international law and to demand free and fair elections in the country.
Latin America
The countries of Latin America are not only important economic partners, but many are also our value partners. The many democracies there are natural partners for Europe in strengthening multilateralism. Forums such as the revived summit between the EU and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) enable intensive cooperation and partnership with the countries of the continent.
In some Latin American countries, authoritarian governments have established themselves that severely restrict civil society's scope for action. Democratic states are also still under pressure, as demonstrated by the storming of government buildings in Brazil in early 2023. Events like these make it clear that democracy must be defended against autocratic tendencies and groups.
Cooperation with democratically elected governments and a strong civil society are essential for this. We want to protect activists for human rights, environmental protection and the rights of LGBTIQ*, women and indigenous people and actively support their work. Effectively combating corruption and drug-related crime is also important. In addition to police and criminal law measures, this also includes the creation of
economic alternatives, reducing dependencies on cartels and strengthening cross-border investigations.
Over 55 percent of the world's rainforest is located in Latin America. The region is central to protecting our global climate. That is why we want to intensify climate, commodity and development partnerships and expand cooperation for sustainable agriculture and effective nature and tropical forest conservation. The protection of the rights of indigenous peoples must be considered and prioritized in all projects.
Europe needs close trade relations with Latin America, not least in order to diversify its supply chains with a view to China. These can only be successful if they are negotiated in a spirit of partnership, both sides benefit and a substantial share of trade is created.
part of the added value remains in Latin America. The EU's Global Gateway Initiative can play an important role in this. We want to learn from the mistakes of the past and shape our future trade policy in such a way that no environmental destruction is fueled and no neo-colonial exploitation occurs. We want partnerships at eye level. We reject the
EU-Mercosur agreement in its current form and call for renegotiations to bring about fundamental changes - for a fair, ecological and post-colonial agreement that respects human rights, promotes technology transfer, and promotes the development of new technologies.
and puts an end to the intensive extraction of raw materials in the Global South for consumption in the Global North. We will only ratify the Mercosur agreement if both sides agree to implementable, verifiable and legally binding, enforceable obligations in the areas of environmental, social and climate protection. Especially in times of right- wing populist governments, all of these standards can only be implemented if violations of them can be sanctioned just as effectively as the trade provisions of the agreement. The possibility of suspending trade preferences
The protection of the environment in the event of violations of sustainability standards is therefore an essential prerequisite for approval of the agreement. At the same time, for us, the Mercosur agreement can only exist together with an equivalent additional agreement on the protection and preservation of the rainforest, the protection of indigenous peoples and human rights. This will ensure that our partnership with the Mercosur countries is intensified and that human rights, biodiversity and the global climate are protected at the same time.
 What protects freedom 
The European Union (EU) is an area of freedom, security and democracy. Europeans have built it on the ruins of war and oppression. Today, it guarantees that we can travel without border controls where barbed wire, walls and barriers once separated us. It ensures freedom of expression where dictators ruled just a few decades ago. It protects the rule of law. It guarantees that all EU citizens can freely elect their governments - from the municipal level to Brussels.
The Europe that we want to continue to shape offers security and protection, brings people together and integrates them. We must not only endure differences, but see them as opportunities; we must build bridges across borders and divides; we must seek the unifying element instead of inactively accepting what divides us: Nothing else is the founding idea of the EU.
But security and protection need institutions that create and maintain them. We want to strengthen them. Extremism, disinformation and crime do not stop at national borders, on the contrary: in recent years in particular, we have
experienced how authoritarian states attack our free society. The EU has a responsibility to offer the protection that citizens rightly expect through coordination and strong institutions of its own - especially as this experience of security and state reliability directly increases trust in the democratic association of states that makes up the EU.
The development of the EU is a development towards an ever closer alliance. This is good, because we need the EU's weight and capabilities to solve many of the pressing problems of our time. How we do this must be determined in a democratic process. At the heart of this is the European Parliament, whose rights we want to extend. In this way, we will create the basis for a federal European republic with its own constitution. Even if decision-making processes in Europe are sometimes tedious and lengthy, they are still of great value: with the power of the word and discussion, a compromise is often reached at the end that may not completely satisfy everyone, but helps everyone move forward. This is what we stand for.
After all, the increase in freedom, security and democracy that European unification has brought since the Second World War is one of the greatest political successes in world history. It is not without reason that the EU is the target of extremists of all kinds: those who believe that women should not have the same rights as men, those who want to silence free media, those who want to enforce their interests through disinformation and hate speech - the EU is a thorn in their side.
We want to strengthen the EU's ability to protect the rights and freedoms of those who live here. Our credo: We protect our freedom best when we expand it. We want to strengthen European democracy so that the best ideas can compete fairly for the future of our continent. We want to expand the rule of law, which offers all citizens security and equal rights. We want an EU that works for its citizens. We want them to be able to have an even clearer say in its course through the European Parliament.
And we also want the EU to demonstrate the necessary assertiveness internally, for example against governments such as Viktor Orbán's Hungarian government: Anyone who violates the EU's fundamental values should not be able to benefit from its privileges without restriction.
The possibility of equal participation for all is one of these fundamental values - and a basic prerequisite for our cohesion. This applies not least to women's rights. As long as half of the population is disadvantaged in many areas of life, our democracy will not be complete. And as long as trans, inter and non-binary people are discriminated against, not everyone can participate equally. Authoritarian forces within and outside Europe are calling our cohesion into question by declaring individual groups to be the enemy. This weakens us all and threatens to divide our continent. We are firmly opposed to this. A diverse Europe is a strong Europe: it ensures that everyone can contribute and participate. We stand firmly by the side of all those who are marginalized and discriminated against. And because we see the EU as a pioneer of value- driven digitalization, we also want to safeguard democracy and the rule of law online.
The EU is strong when it is essentially an alliance of values. These values must be credibly
be lived. This applies not least when dealing with people who want - or need - to come to Europe. The deaths in the Mediterranean and the situation at Europe's external borders are untenable. We stand for humanity and order in dealing with refugees. We want to offer protection for people fleeing war and political persecution. have to flee. We want to shape immigration in such a way that those who want to contribute to the success of our community as computer scientists or nurses, as students or harvest workers can also make this contribution. Migration is not only a driving force for progress, it is also an effort.
People come to Europe with different perspectives, experiences and images of society. We want to face up to this major challenge politically. So that
this succeeds, it requires the willingness to work together
Shaping immigration societies on the basis of European values. This applies to the people who live here as well as to those who come to Europe, some of whom have completely different values.
United in diversity, that is the motto of the EU. It should be a community, it should remain a community - across all differences and challenges. We are committed to an EU that sees itself as the driving force behind the ever closer integration of our continent. For a continent in which people live securely in freedom and under democratic values. For an EU that offers a home and does not isolate itself. We want to be this Europe.
1. Democratic institutions
Defending the rule of law
Respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law, including the rights of minorities, is the foundation of the EU. When governments in member states systematically erode this value base by undermining the independence of the judiciary - the first guardian of the rule of law -, c u r t a i l i n g	t h e freedom of the opposition and civil society, fighting free media, restricting women's, minority and LGBTIQ* rights, denying the right to asylum or opening the door to corruption, they pave the way for discrimination.
In doing so, they weaken the EU. It is therefore essential that the existing rule of law instruments are used and developed more consistently and quickly.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, the basic law of the EU, is intended to offer protection to all people living here. As its application is limited to the implementation of EU law, its protective effect has so far been limited. We want to change this: it should also apply to purely national actions of the member states and be enforceable there. If
a government violates the fundamental rights of its citizens
violated, it should also be able to be prosecuted at European level. We also want to strengthen the enforceability of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, which monitors compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, within the EU.
We want to give more weight to the existing Rule of Law Check and the Rule of Law Dialogue, which examine the rule of law situation in all member states. We will ensure that the freedom of civil society in particular is measured and protected in a more targeted manner. In order to increase the pressure for reform, we rely on binding reform agreements between the EU and the member states, which must be subject to sanctions in the future. Public debates on this in the European Parliament must become the rule and be incorporated into the assessments. The rule of law procedure under Article 7, which can lead, for example, to the withdrawal of voting rights in a multi-stage procedure, should be made usable again. This is to be achieved by the Member States in the Council of the EU (Council of Ministers) and in the European Council no longer voting by consensus but by qualified majority at all stages of the procedure.
The disbursement of EU funds should be linked to compliance with the rule of law, democratic principles and fundamental rights. In order to effectively stop the misuse of European taxpayers' money, for example through systematic corruption, favoritism and nepotism in favor of certain parties, the review must not stand alone. An effective separation of powers and the comprehensive granting of fundamental rights are also crucial. That is why we are extending the budget mechanism to include compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This means that in the event of violations, EU funds must be frozen proportionately and, if necessary, in stages.
When it comes to infringement proceedings, we rely on clear rules and more transparency. The Commission fulfills its role as guardian of the treaties when the law is respected. Delayed enforcement of EU law harms everyone.
In order to strengthen our common values, we rely on a better coordinated, mutually reinforcing application of all legal instruments between the Council, Commission and European Parliament. We combine the respective findings into a common basis for evaluation. In order to guarantee a regular charter check that is accepted by all member states, we are creating an independent commission of experts to support the EU Commission. If member states want to receive EU funding in the future, they must commit to cooperating with the European Public Prosecutor's Office. However, when funds are cut, it must not be the people in the municipalities who ultimately suffer because corrupt governments shirk their financial responsibility and prefer to point the finger at Brussels. Therefore check
we are investigating how municipalities can be
supported directly.
Daring more democracy
The strengthening of the EU must go hand in hand with its further democratization and greater proximity to citizens. To this end, we want to further strengthen the directly elected European Parliament. The Parliament should be on an equal footing with the Council in all policy areas and, like any parliament, be able to pass laws on an equal footing, for example in tax or security policy. It should be given a full right of initiative so that it can initiate laws independently. We want to extend its right to convene committees of inquiry and summon witnesses. It should also be able to elect the Commission on the proposal of the Commission President and dismiss it again in an emergency.
More democratic legitimacy of decisions at EU level requires more transparency in the European Council and in the Councils of Ministers. The debates and the positions of the individual member states should be made more comprehensible.
Our vision is the European Federal Republic with a European constitution. The parliament should be united in a bicameral system.
become an equal part of the legislative power with the Council.
In order to make the European elections more European and democratic, we want all parties to nominate lead candidates. In turn, the European Parliament elects the next President of the Commission from their ranks. In addition, only candidates from their own country are eligible to stand in the European elections. We want to change this in the interests of a cross-border election campaign. In future, some MEPs should no longer be elected via national lists alone, but via European transnational lists. The European affiliation of national parties should also be clearly recognizable in the remaining national or regional constituencies. We also advocate that the European Parliament should better represent women and underrepresented groups.
We advocate lowering the barriers to voting. Anyone who lives permanently in the EU must also be able to participate in politics there. EU citizens should be able to vote at their permanent place of residence in the Union - not only for local parliaments and the European Parliament, but also in regional and national elections. Anyone who has their permanent place of residence in Germany must have the opportunity to take part in all elections, votes and democratic processes here on an equal footing.
Young people are getting involved and want to help shape Europe. That is why the introduction of the right to vote from the age of 16 in Germany for the European elections was a great success.
We want young people to be better involved in political processes. That is why we will lower the voting age further if necessary on the basis of an evaluation immediately following the European elections.
In addition to the democratic representation of citizens in the European Parliament, we also want to enable more direct participation at EU level. In the Parliament, we will also
work towardsgiving MPs more time to work in their home regions so that they can be approached locally.
With the European Citizens' Forum, whichtook place for the first time in this legislature as a conference on the future, European citizens, who are drawn at random and representatively from the entire population of the EU, can formulate concrete proposals for action in a citizens' report. We want to firmly establish this instrument, enable digital participation and workto ensure that citizens' proposals are implemented.
We want to expand the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), which allows citizens to place an issue directly on the European political agenda, and make it more binding and better known.
A successful ECI must be followed by a legislative proposal from the European Commission within one year and submitted to the European Parliament and the Council for a vote. The initiators of an ECI should also be able to convene a European Citizens' Forum as an intermediate step.
Becoming more capable of action
In view of the many challenges we face, we are dependent on an EU that is capable of acting. That is why we want to make decisions faster by extending majority voting, for example by applying the passerelle clause. Where unanimity was previously required between states and decisions could therefore easily be blocked, in future, voting should be by qualified majority. It is important that the interests of smaller member states continue to be heard and respected.
Secondly, we want to make better use of the enhanced cooperation clause provided for in the treaties. It allows a group of at least nine EU Member States to cooperate more closely in selected policy areas and initiate joint projects. This will enable them to get important projects off the ground more quickly.
the future. What is important for us is that the European Parliament should be involved - and all other member states should also be able to join in at a later date.
Some of the reforms are possible without amending the treaty. They should be implemented swiftly and promptly. A number of the reform proposals that we advocate require a treaty amendment. To this end, we want to convene a convention with the involvement of EU citizens.
This should incorporate the recommendations of the groundbreaking Conference on the Future of the EU. Here, citizens played a key role in formulating new perspectives for the EU.
Fighting corruption
Democracy depends on the trust of citizens, any appearance of politics for sale causes damage. We are therefore ensuring greater transparency in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council in order to strengthen the credibility of democratic processes and trust in the EU. We make lobbying interests and conflicts of interest visible to everyone. With the corruption scandal involving individual MEPs in 2022, this is more urgent than ever. We support the extension of criminal liability for bribery and corruption of MEPs at EU level.
We are finally putting the European Parliament's Code of Conduct into sharp focus. Financial penalties must be swiftly enforced in the event of legally established violations. With a lobby register that is binding for all EU institutions, including the Council, we will disclose who comes in and out of the institutions at all political levels. We will make those who influence legislation visible by means of a "legislative footprint", which will make it comprehensively comprehensible which positions have been introduced in the legislative process.
We will put an end to ineffective self-regulation and set up an independent ethics authority to enforce the rules on lobbing control for all EU institutions. When switching between politics and business, we will ensure that there are clear
time rules that are adapted to transitional payments and for their control. The fact that MEPs now have to disclose their financial circumstances to Parliament and investigating authorities makes corruption more difficult. We want to make this transparent, as is already the case in many Member States.
We guarantee more fairness with an EU-wide database that transparently records political online advertising and its clients and donors and sets clear limits on the use of personal data in digital election campaign advertising
in democratic competition and more protection against disinformation and online hate.
The legal framework for the confiscation of assets acquired through corruption or from the proceeds of such illegal assets is to be further strengthened.
2. Feminism
Making Europe a driving force for women's rights and equality
We want a Europe in which all people, regardless of gender, can live self-determined lives and participate equally. Structural disadvantage and gender-specific discrimination prevent women, trans, inter and non-binary people in particular from doing so.
Our response to this is a feminism that takes all people and multiple discrimination into account.
Women and girls should be able to live an equal and self-determined life throughout the EU. In politics, business, culture, science and society - there is still a lot to be done everywhere. Europe has often been a pioneer for women's rights and gender equality. But right-wing and right-wing conservative forces in many countries are targeting our achievements. They are trying to push women out of the labor market through backward-looking family policies. Reproductive rights, especially the right to abortion, are human rights
and must apply equally to all and in all member states. However, the reproductive rights of women, especially those from marginalized groups such as queer women, are being openly questioned.
Achievements
in the fight against violence against women are being pushed back and the rights of trans, inter and non-binary people are being called into question. We are opposing this with all our might.
Our goal is for the EU to become a guarantor of gender equality on our continent. Gender equality should permeate all policy areas of the Union. That is why we want to strengthen and expand the EIGE (European Institute for Gender Equality). This requires greater knowledge, more data and scientific expertise. This is another reason why we will continue to promote gender studies and defend them against attacks.
The EU Commission's Gender Equality Strategy, which expires in 2025, must be evaluated swiftly and comprehensively. Based on these results, we will draw up an ambitious plan in the coming legislative period in order to make great strides towards equality.
All people must be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and their lives. We therefore also want the EU to strengthen the self- determination rights of women and girls. This includes ensuring reproductive health and the right to physical self-determination and self- determined family planning for all. We want to strengthen unrestricted access to contraceptives. Professional advice on family planning is the basis for self-determined decisions.
It must be widely available in the EU. We support the initiative to enshrine the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Access to menstrual hygiene products is part of good healthcare. That is why we want to improve it.
Realizing equal opportunities on the labor market
Everyone benefitswhen women have better opportunities on the labor market. As engineers, educators, doctors and in countless other professions, they create prosperity - for Europe and for themselves: because fair participation in the labor market helps women to improve their economic situation and avoid poverty in old age, for example. We also want to pave the way politically to achieve this goal.
The gender pay gap, i.e. the gap between men's and women's wages, is wide in all EU countries. On average
It is 12.1 percent in Germany and even around 18 percent. The adoption of the Pay Transparency Directive was therefore a great success. It creates more transparency through the right to information and reports, compensation claims in the event of gender-based pay discrimination and thus strengthens the rights of female employees. We are doing everything we can to ensure that this directive is also implemented consistently in the member states. And, of course, so-called care professions, which are mainly carried out by women, must be upgraded through better working conditions and pay, and the fairer distribution of paid work and unpaid care work between women and men must be improved.
In order to create equal access and advancement opportunities for women in the labor market and to increase gender equality, the European Council issued a reconciliation directive. This is intended to enable parents to reconcile their professional and private lives as partners. With the family start time, which allows partners to take 14 days off work after the birth, the German government will take a further step towards fulfillment and support couples in the division of work between partners. We are continuing to push for the implementation and expansion of this directive. In particular, we want to encourage fathers to take parental leave. A good work-life balance for couples
is an effective measure to counteract the existing shortage of skilled workers by increasing the employment rate of women. Many women would like to work more, and more and more men would like to share family tasks equally - but the conditions do not allow it.
Particularly striking is the low proportion of women in all areas of the so-called STEM professions and the corresponding degree courses throughout Europe. Even though the number of female first-year students is increasing, this is not reflected in academic careers. This must change, because in view of the shortage of jobs and skilled workers, it would be downright negligent to forego this potential. Accordingly, we want to actively promote women and girls and, at the same time, improve the labor supply for the STEM sector. At EU level, we are also calling for better financing options for loans and equity financing for young female entrepreneurs and innovators through EU funds and programs, as well as easier access for women to existing funds, but also to well-paid jobs.
Enforce protection against violence
We want a Europe that offers protection and support for all victims of gender-based violence. We are committed to ensuring that violence against women is prevented, prosecuted and condemned through preventive measures. An important building block for this is the financial independence of women, especially mothers and their children, as it facilitates separation from violent partners and is therefore an important prerequisite for a self-determined life. The Istanbul Convention is the first instrument in Europe to lay down legally binding standards specifically to combat violence against women and domestic violence. Thanks to the German government's initiative, all reservations have finally been lifted in Germany.
To date, however, six member states - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia - have not yet ratified this convention. It is therefore a
It is a great success that the EU itself has acceded to the Istanbul Convention comprehensively and without exceptions. We want all services provided by the Member States to protect women to at least meet the obligations of the Istanbul Convention and its explanatory report - including the standards for shelters, support centers for victims and emergency hotlines. In addition, intersectional protection concepts and shelters, especially for trans, inter and non-binary people, must be developed and provided. The supplementary new EU directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence must now also be adopted and implemented swiftly. We are committed to ensuring that the Istanbul Convention is also implemented with regard to the protection needs of trans, inter, lesbian and non-binary people.
is implemented.
Women affected by violence whose residence status depends on the residence status of their husband or partner should be able to obtain an independent residence permit. To make it easier for these women to claim and enforce their rights, they need low-threshold access to trained multilingual advice and support structures.
Sex workers also need rights and protection from violence, stigmatization and criminalization.
Strengthening women's rights and combating human trafficking
Human trafficking is a serious criminal offense and human rights violation that we must consistently combat through joint European action. The most widespread form of human trafficking in the EU is for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Trafficked persons are forced to work in prostitution under inhumane conditions. More than half of the victims of human trafficking for the purposeofsexual exploitation in the EU are EU citizens, predominantly women and girls.
We want to strengthen international cooperation in prevention, prosecution and protection.
of those affected along the lines of existing agreements. In order to better protect women from human trafficking and violence, we want to strengthen their rights. We are doing this by supportingthe upcoming revision of the
EU Victims' Rights Directive to ensure that all victims of crime are better protected. We want to strengthen access to information on victims' rights and ensure good coordination between the Member States, public bodies and judicial authorities. The protection of victims must be at the center of our actions. Deporting victims of human trafficking is wrong. Instead, we want to protect them through permanent residence rights and protection programs. This would also increase their willingness to report and testify and make it easier to prosecute the perpetrators.
Turning half the power into reality
As long as women are not adequately represented in key areas of the economy, politics and society, democracy is not complete. Even in Europe, we still have to look with a magnifying glass to find women on supervisory boards and management boards. We welcome the fact that the directive on management positions has finally come into force. The Commission must now ensure that the relevant quotas are achieved through regular reviews. After all, binding quotas are an effective means of ensuring that management bodies in business and politics are gender parity, including in the institutions of the EU itself. The Commission itself should also have gender parity.
To make financial power in Europe more gender- equitable, we want effective gender budgeting and gender equality checks
for the EU budget. We have succeeded in making future EU budgets fairer for all genders: The new Financial Regulation now stipulates that the allocation of EU funds by gender must be made transparent. We are committed to ensuring that this transparency is also emphasized in the negotiations with the Council and included in the Financial Regulation for the EU.
all funding is determined. This makes existing inequities in the distribution of funds visible and can be corrected. The Commission has also developed a method for measuring
of the impact of budget funds on equality. However, this still needs to be improved in some areas. Due to the new data situation, the next multiannual financial framework must be designed to be gender-equitable.
3. Europe's diversity
Strengthening civil society
Europe is characterized by its diversity and the coexistence of different people. Queer and non- queer people, people with and without disabilities, atheists and religious people, young and old each contribute their perspectives on life and shape our coexistence and our democracy. Our pluralistic democracy is strong because people in citizens' initiatives and parties, associations, non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and religious communities shape a vibrant civil society. It is the task of the EU to safeguard these freedoms.
We therefore support the European civil society in thinking and organizing itself across borders. In the European Parliament, we have successfully launched an initiative for a European law on associations. In this way, we are ensuring that civil society initiatives can operate with legal certainty throughout Europe.
Civil society initiatives are often the first point of contact for people who experience discrimination such as anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny or queerophobia and violence. We want to further promote and expand the existing advisory structures so that they can provide appropriate advice to those affected.
We are committed to ensuring that funding programs such as "Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values" (CERV) are adequately funded.
become. For example, we support initiatives and self-advocacy organizations that campaign against discrimination and for equal rights for all people and are particularly active in countries wherethe rule of law, democracy and minority rights are under particular pressure. We must also strengthen and safeguard the values of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, such as freedom of assembly, in the EU.
We firmly oppose the restriction of civil society's scope for action and are committed to the protection of human rights defenders within the EU.
Religion and faith are part of our cultures and have an integrative power for broad sections of society. They are the basis of many communities and institutions that contribute to cohesion. Religious freedom is constitutive for a diverse and free society. People who are persecuted because of their faith, non-faith or world view deserve our protection. We want to deepen interfaith dialogue and support communities in this,
to bring people of different faiths into contact with each other. We are convinced that mutual respect and dialog at eye level will strengthen our diverse Europe.
Overcoming discrimination
Safety, the right to physical integrity and civil rights apply to all people. They are the prerequisite for a life
in freedom. They must apply regardless of where a person comes from, how he or she loves, lives or believes. A Europe that holds together in its diversity and protects the rights of each and every individual creates democratic progress, participation and freedom for all. However, people in Europe are still exposed to violence and exclusion due to anti-Semitism, racism and other forms of group-based misanthropy. We want to eliminate discrimination at all levels.
In order to fulfill the promise of a diverse Europe of participation, the EU must take consistent legal action against discrimination.
approach. We want to draw particular attention to multiple discrimination.
Anti-Semitism is still deeply entrenched in the heart of European society. Jewish institutions are threatened and attacked.
We are resolutely opposed to this. This applies in particular to us as Germany and to the promise "Never again!", to which Europe also committed itself after the Second World War and the Shoah. It is the responsibility of all member states to guarantee the safety of Jewish communities and to ensure that Jews in Europe have a secure future.
We are therefore in favor of increasing European funding for security projects to support them in this. As Europeans, it is not
It is not only our task to counter anti-Semitism in all its forms, but also to make Jewish life visible in all its diversity and to strengthen it. Culture plays an important role in this. The perspectives of Jewish artists are an important part of European culture. Discrimination and boycotts against Jews must therefore be resolutely opposed. In order to impart knowledge about Jewish life in general as well as contacts and experiences with Jewish people throughout Europe, we want to promote political and cultural education programs.
Muslims are the second largest religious community in Europe. Muslim life is part of Europe and at the same time has become the target of right-wing and conspiracy ideology movements.
We welcome the fact that, after a long time, the EU has finally filled the position of EU coordinator against Islamophobia. We want to strengthen her role.
We want the fight against antigypsyism to become a new priority and move away from paternalistic approaches. People with a Romani background are often disadvantaged when it comes to access to education, health, housing and work. We are setting up a European advisory body to promote political participation and the fight against racism against Sinti*zze and Rom*nja. This includes
We work with experts, self-advocacy organizations and local and regional authorities, among others. We advocate the introduction of binding laws to promote equal participation.
People who experience discrimination, whether by public institutions, in housing or on the labor market, must not be left alone, but must know that the law is on their side. The EU has the potential to improve protection against discrimination, be it on the basis of social origin, racial discrimination, sexual orientation, disability or age. We want to make consistent use of this. In order to standardize and strengthen the level of protection and close gaps in protection, we want, among other things, the 5th Anti-Discrimination Directive to finally be adopted. Germany should also give up its reservation. We stand firmly by the side of people who experience violence as a result of discrimination and want to support them, for example by providing access to legal, medical and psychological advice. We want to strengthen the systematic recording of cases of discrimination throughout Europe in order to further develop European anti-discrimination work in a targeted and scientifically sound manner.
We want to promote research into racism and its various forms, such as anti-black racism, at European level. The
We are driving forward the UN Decade for People of African Descent. Measures to reduce racism, anti-Semitism and discrimination should be developed with the continuous involvement of experts and self-advocacy organizations. We also want the EU to support member states, for example through training, in counteracting discriminatory attitudes in law enforcement agencies. The office of the European Commission's Anti-Racism Commissioner should be strengthened and staffed beyond 2025. We support the Minority Safe Pack initiative and want to strengthen minority rights such as the preservation of language, culture and identity in the EU. We also need an independent institutional European
Promotion of national minorities. In order to guarantee minority rights in the EU, the responsibility for the protection of national minorities and autochthonous ethnic groups should be bindingly regulated within the EU Commission.
The diversity of European society is currently not adequately reflected in the staff of the European Commission. We are therefore working to ensure that the Commission, as an employer, actively develops and implements concepts for discrimination-sensitive opening, for example in application procedures.
Protecting queer rights
The opportunity to develop freely and live in one's own individuality is a core of European values.
Although queer people have been able to successfully fight for many of their rights in recent decades, we are seeing authoritarian forces trying to roll them back. Queer people still do not have access to non-discriminatory healthcare, a self- determined change in their gender registration or marriage everywhere. It is not uncommon for lesbian, gay, bi, trans*, inter* and queer people (LGBTIQ*) to be unable to lead a self-determined life in safety because their rights are restricted or they are hostile, pathologized or attacked in everyday life and queer hostility is widespread in large parts of society. We do not accept this and clearly oppose these attempts, regardless of their motivation or who they come from. We want a Europe that recognizes sexual and gender diversity as a matter of course.
On our initiative, the European Parliament has declared the EU an "LGBTIQ* Freedom Zone". On this basis, we are committed to ensuring that the EU Commission and the Council use all the instruments at their disposal - including
infringement proceedings and sanctions - to stop the systematic actions of governments against LGBTIQ* people and the dismantling of democracy and the rule of law.
pen. In this way, we are strengthening the community in its fight for its rights in these countries.
In order to combat queer hostility, we are committed to continuing the European Commission's LGBTIQ* equality strategy beyond 2025 and are working towards its further development with the participation of civil society. We want to set up an EU-wide multilingual advice hotline to which victims of queer hostility can turn for low-threshold advice.
Family is where people take responsibility for each other - for example with two mothers, two fathers, several parents, single parents or with a mother and father. We are committed to equality for two- mother families and for a non-discriminatory life for rainbow families. National borders must not determine whether children grow up with their parents, because the right to freedom of movement must also apply to rainbow families without ifs and buts. We are fighting for parenthood, registered partnerships, extended custody declarations and same-sex marriages established in one EU country to be recognized throughout the EU.
Realizing an inclusive society
We want an inclusive society that overcomes disadvantages of all kinds and offers equal opportunities and possibilities to all people. Consistently removing barriers ensures cohesion, prosperity and freedom. The European disability movement has successfully campaigned for their right to equality and participation. With the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the EU member states have committed themselves to removing all barriers that stand in the way of participation in political and social life. We want to ensure that this finally becomes a reality throughout Europe.
In order to enable self-determined living, we want to provide greater support for independent living, inclusive living and working. In particular, we want to promote participation in work
and training in the regular system and consistently expand them. The Commission should regularly review the progress made in the Member States. We want to further develop the sheltered workshop system in the direction of inclusive companies - because social protection and minimum wages must also apply to people with disabilities. EU funds should not flow into forms of work that are contrary to Article 27 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and inclusion companies should be promoted more strongly.
The needs-based expansion of affordable, barrier- free and disabled-friendly housing and self- determined forms of living is and remains a central task in shaping an inclusive society.
People with disabilities are more affected by violence than non-disabled people. We want protection from violence to apply to all people in Europe. We are committed to ensuring that forced sterilizations, which particularly affect women and girls with disabilities, are ended in Europe and made a punishable offence.
Poor usability of websites, steps without ramps, doors that are too narrow - people with disabilities, but also older people or people with limited mobility, experience various barriers in their everyday lives that restrict their participation in public life. We are committed to ensuring that the EU Accessibility Directive, known as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), is implemented and enforceable in all member states - including Germany - in a timely manner. In order to support the member states in implementing accessibility measures in a coherent manner, we want to set up an EU Accessibility Center.
We want to strengthen and consolidate the office of the Equal Opportunities Commissioner. We want to remove bureaucratic hurdles and technical standards that prevent people with disabilities from participating and check that they are barrier-free.
In order to guarantee European freedom of movement for people with disabilities, we want to
We will introduce a European disability card that can be applied for at a low threshold, implement mutual recognition of national definitions of disability and barrier-free travel throughout Europe. This also applies to the use of social benefits.
4. A vibrant cultural landscape
Culture as a pillar of democracy
Few things unite Europe as much as its diverse, vibrant culture. It arises from the interplay of traditions from the entire continent
with external influences and the constant development of new forms of expression. Culture is a value in itself and at the same time an indispensable part of European democracy, because it is here that exchange and coexistence across borders take place in the most diverse ways. An open and diverse culture is the best protection against nationalistic thinking, isolationism and lack of freedom. Because of their indispensability for a consolidated democratic society, cultural institutions and cultural workers are put under massive pressure and even attacked by right-wing extremist forces. We therefore defend free art and culture against anti-democrats and state interference and support them through public funding that enables artistic creativity beyond the logic of the market.
We therefore want to expand the "Creative Europe" program financially and simplify it significantly in order to facilitate cooperation and exchange between artists and cultural organizers throughout Europe. It should see itself as a service provider for cultural professionals that is approachable and provides fast and targeted support. The independent scene in particular should be given new access to strengthen European exchange, for example for ensembles and groups that work together across borders. To this end, we are also developing offers for groups that have been separated due to flight and migration.
The EU must guarantee and support the freedom of culture and its diversity. We therefore want to shape cultural funding in such a way that it is also open to those who have few own resources or no national funding.
The goal of climate neutrality is particularly relevant to the European dimension of culture, which thrives on the movement of cultural assets and people. We therefore want to create a program within the framework of Creative Europe in which advice and funding for the transformation of European cultural cooperation towards climate neutrality are bundled. We also want to further develop the idea of the New European Bauhaus, which promotes an interdisciplinary approach to climate-neutral building and design, in a participatory manner and anchor it as a separate mission in Horizon Europe.
Cross-border cultural exchange also requires unbureaucratic and fair regulations for the taxation of income from artistic activities that avoid double taxation.
The European Capitals of Culture program allows us to experience and promote the diversity of our continent. We want to continue this successful concept, but at the same time review the application procedures and make them more transparent.
European culture also includes its growing structure of independent and diverse cultural and creative industries with small and medium-sized enterprises. They create games, films, series and books, work in the design industry, the art market, the music industry, the press market, architecture, the broadcasting industry, the performing arts and the advertising market. They are key drivers of innovation and growth - far beyond their own sector. We want to promote these structures and protect them against the market power of the large international platforms, for example by advocating the preservation of the cultural exception in trade agreements. We want to strengthen the local structure of bookshops by working to ensure that price-
bound books are exempt from the rules of European public procurement law.
With the KulturPass, the federal government has introduced a new, innovative cultural policy instrument: Young people are given a budget to discover art and culture in all its diversity and breadth. In this way, we are also strengthening cultural institutions. Building on similar projects in France, Spain and Italy, we now want to introduce a joint European cultural passport so that young people can explore and discover the wealth and diversity of culture in Europe across borders.
Strengthening creativity
The creative power of artists and creatives is the basis for our vibrant cultural landscape. In the face of technological and societal changes, they must constantly reassert their place in the exploitation chain of cultural production. This applies above all to the new developments in artificial intelligence (AI). This uses images, sounds and texts created by humans togenerate new content. AI products compete with human creators. We are therefore committed to ensuring that authors can exercise their reservation of use and, where applicable, other rights vis-à-vis commercial AI simply and centrally and, where appropriate, in a machine- readable manner. Copyright law should continue to protect the creative work of natural persons and must not be extended to automatically generated content from AI systems. We want authors
to support the fair remuneration of their works
and at the same time strengthen access to knowledge and culture for all in order to create good conditions for the creatives of tomorrow. Work users as well as authors and other cultural professionals such as actors and musicians must havea seat at the table when the course of the digitalized cultural world is being negotiated. In the interest of equal opportunities, we also want to enable digital lending (e-lending) of content in the context of libraries, educational and research institutions, as has been the case to date.
By extending the Erasmus program to artists and creatives, we want to further strengthen the mobility and European perspective of cultural professionals. We want to offer a safe haven and support opportunities for cultural workers who are at risk of persecution outside the EU.
We also want to close the gender pay gap in culture. We will strengthen the role of women in the cultural sector, for example by advocating equal representation on awarding bodies and juries in the EU.
Guaranteeing media freedom
Free and democratically oriented media are an indispensable basis for the formation of public opinion. This foundation is also under attack in EU member states today. We therefore support more transparency about ownership structures and binding instruments to combat the restriction of press freedom - be it in the form of open censorship, through the control and centralization of publisher ownership or by other means. Here, too, we believe that all control mechanisms must follow the principle of independence from the state. Media freedom also means that journalists and editors can work freely within the framework of professional standards or editorial statutes. A new European body for media services must not undermine existing media rights and freedoms in Germany. In order to protect journalists and their sources from surveillance and persecution, we call for effective regulation and judicial control of the use o f	spyware. We will take action against misuse. We want to effectively protect whistleblowers from persecution.
Excessive concentration of media ownership, including in individual EU states, must be effectively prevented - if necessary by splitting up companies or ownership structures. Transparency of ownership structures is essential for this. This is the basis for a diverse press landscape that enables journalists to report freely and critically.
The economic model of private media in print and online is also severely impaired by false incentive structures in the competition for advertising revenue and the market power of social media platforms. This is threatening the existence of more and more quality media and is a pressing problem for diversity of opinion. We are therefore striving to use suitable instruments to improve the competitive situation for journalistic offerings - especially online - and to develop practicable financing instruments at member state level to strengthen journalistic content, develop sustainable business models and ensure a nationwide supply of journalistic offerings.
Where new technologies such as generative AI are used, we advocate clear labeling of AI-generated images, texts and videos.
The EU's cross-border and linguistic area poses a particular challenge for the development of a common public sphere. We therefore advocate the expansion of transnational and multilingual public service broadcasting. Specifically, we first want to expand the successful approach of the arte channel and gradually develop it into a joint European offering.
In addition, we are committed to networking the offerings of public service broadcasting in Europe and to improving findability.
European cultural and media offerings online. In this way, we want to create a fully-fledged European, public media offering in the long term, with a comprehensive and transnational offering of news, sport, culture and entertainment, for example in the form of a European media portal.
The
is also a contribution against disinformation and conspiracy myths. We want to create support and protection for media in exile so that the EU can also be a space of free expression for people from countries where freedom of the press and freedom of opinion are suppressed.
European remembrance
The memory of past injustice is one of the foundations of all societies. Europe as a continent was not only characterized by war and violence for centuries; war and violence also emanated from here for centuries. As a peace project, the EU has the task of relating these perspectives to one another. Remembrance should contribute to reconciliation and understanding, not divide. It is important to promote a multi-perspective culture of remembrance that also takes into account the history of groups that have been unjustly ignored. We want to strengthen cross-border cooperation and are committed to preserving existing places of collective remembrance, commemoration and reflection as well as creating new ones. We want to use European funds to support initiatives that are dedicated to the task of understanding and, for example, make the historically overlapping experiences of violence caused by Germany's war of aggression and the oppression by the Soviet Union understandable and comprehensible in their complex legacy in Eastern Europe. Here
This also includes cooperation with schools,
universities and cultural institutions as well as supporting civil society actors. We firmly oppose efforts to reinterpret history in the service of nationalist tendencies.
We clearly oppose all attempts to draw a "line" under the memory of the crimes of National Socialism and especially the Shoah or to make them harmless. They are incompatible with democratic values. We will not leave this unanswered - not in Germany, not in Europe, not anywhere.
The cruel history of genocide, colonialism, enslavement and exploitation in Africa, Latin America and Asia is also part of the European legacy. Even during the emergence of the European peace project, colonial violence and economic exploitation persisted. Many European states and companies were involved in these crimes, and Europe still benefits today from the dependencies created at that time.
capabilities. That is why we want to work closely with descendants, researchers and civil society initiatives from formerly colonized areas to come to terms with colonial history, including at a European level, and strive for reparations. This includes the restitution of looted art or human remains, for example, but also the promotion of educational work and the strengthening of multi- perspective historical research. The effects of colonialism o n today's societies should become more visible. To this end, we want to strengthen the remembrance policy dimension in thematically appropriate EU funding programs.
Fair play in sport
Whether it's amateur soccer or the Champions League, a bike ride or the Tour de France - sport is at the heart of Europe. Exercise and sport unites people, creates and conveys regional identities, provides a topic of conversation and contributes to the development of Europe.
to health. The focus is on the many people who volunteer in clubs and associations. We want to strengthen organizations and initiatives that are particularly committed to social cohesion, democracy and equality as well as combating exclusion and hatred. We want t o make European funding more easily accessible for them - sports organizations should also be strengthened as important civil society partners outside of Europe.
Sport can only act as a role model and unite people if it functions fairly and transparently and if clubs and associations act in accordance with the law.
Fraud, doping and corruption are diametrically opposed to its essence. We therefore want to establish an independent European agency that works with NGOs, anti-corruption experts and international investigators to ensure transparency, integrity and genuine accountability in cases of corruption and fraud in global sport.
In this way, we want to restore trust. This is also a basis for international
Major sporting events in Europe will continue to have their place. If they work with clear and reliable standards for social and ecological fairness and sustainability, they can gain a competitive advantage worldwide and set an example. We are particularly committed to the cross-border organization of sporting events that protect the climate and the environment. In this way, we make top-class European sport a shared experience.
We want to make sport resilient to the effects of the climate crisis. Many sports depend on an intact natural environment, but at the same time sport causes damage. Through a new European program, we want to show ways in which Europe's diverse sports scene can contribute to meeting climate targets and develop. Our aim is to ensure that sporting events can be held in a climate-neutral way.
5. Refugee and migration policy of humanity and order
Fighting the causes of flight
The number of people displaced by wars, the climate crisis or a lack of economic prospects has doubled worldwide in the last ten years. The vast majority of people are fleeing within their own country or to neighboring regions. However, we are also noticing the effects of the increasing numbers of refugees in Europe. We are facing up to this responsibility, because flight and migration are a historical and global reality and will remain so. The suffering that people experience on escape routes to Europe and at Europe's external borders is intolerable. The fact that people still take these routes shows how great the suffering, danger and lack of prospects are in many regions of the world.
Tightening asylum laws does not tackle the causes of migration. The policies of the EU and its members must recognize their global responsibility.
and also contribute to enabling people in their home regions to live a safe and peaceful life. By expanding reliable humanitarian aid and structure-building transitional aid in crisis regions, we can support people in acute emergencies. In this way, we help to alleviate suffering directly on the ground. With development cooperation on an equal footing and fair trade relations, we can contribute to improving people's prospects in the long term. At the same time, Europe must not close itself off, especially in the face of many crises and disasters, but must take on a fair share of the responsibility for taking in people seeking protection. We advocate the rule of law and humane treatment of people seeking protection in Europe.
Welcoming skilled workers and employees
Europe is facing demographic change with a rapidly ageing population and is desperately looking for skilled workers. In order to secure our future, we must become more attractive in the global competition for skilled workers and labor and shape immigration in a modern way. It is important to us that the interests of the countries of origin are also taken into account, as skilled workers are also needed there. Instead of bureaucratic and lengthy procedures, we want to promote the immigration of specialists and workers with different levels of qualifications with EU-wide common framework regulations. This includes making the recognition of educational qualifications from third countries uniform and unbureaucratic.
In order to recruit qualified specialists, we want to further expand the EU talent pool. This requires more staff in the European embassies and a digitalization offensive so that applications can be submitted quickly and digitally.
An active welcoming culture also makes us attractive as a business location. To achieve this, we must counter racism and exclusion. We want to create targeted integration opportunities for the various forms of migration throughout Europe. In order to offer good
and rapid integration on the ground, we want to strengthen the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). This will enable local authorities to prepare for the admission of skilled workers and their families. In addition, the rights of third- country nationals living here permanently must be protected and preserved. That is why we support an improvement of the Permanent Residence Directive in this direction. We want to promote voluntary circular migration and also train future skilled workers in Europe.
We want to protect all workers against exploitation
- including undocumented workers. Fair working conditions must not depend on origin. To this end, we want to expand multilingual and low-threshold complaint and advice structures and strengthen trade union structures so that all workers can turn to them.
Tackling common asylum policy
We are fighting for an EU that guarantees access to the human right to asylum and complies with humanitarian and international legal obligations such as the UN Refugee Convention. We are currently a long way from achieving this goal. The human rights of refugees are being violated in many places, including at Europe's borders and in EU countries, and disregard for EU law has become part of everyday asylum policy. This has not created order and structure, but more chaos and suffering. The Dublin system is unjust and does not meet the current challenges.
A long-term, orderly and fair common EU asylum policy is needed to put an end to the inhumane and chaotic conditions.
Reforms alone are not enough; existing EU law must also be enforced. We are campaigning against the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) becoming a program to dismantle refugee rights.
We want to use the scope for improvement. With a fair and binding distribution of people seeking protection, we are strengthening solidarity between the member states. Isolation and border fences create chaos and suffering, the rule of law
fair procedures, good integration offers and humane conditions ensure humanity and order.
Countries with Europe's external borders are particularly dependent on orderly distribution and support from the EU as well as solidarity in legal border management. Our goal is a binding distribution mechanism for people seeking protection. On the way there, a permanent, reliable and binding solidarity mechanism should significantly improve distribution.
In order to overcome the common challenges, all member states must get involved - whether by taking in people seeking protection or by providing financial support for the reception of refugees.
Contributions in cash or in kind to third countries are not compensation. Member States that take in refugees to a particularly large extent must be strengthened and financially relieved.
Many municipalities in the EU are prepared to take a bold approach and assume responsibility. We welcome these efforts and are committed to supporting precisely those municipalities that do not receive this support from their national governments. We would like to expand the possibility for municipalities and aid organizations to access the AMIF more directly. European networking and exchange between municipalities can help with integration. This can be seen, for example, in
the successful establishment of cross-border networks of municipalities. When it comes to the distribution of refugees at European level, we want to bring the resources of the federal states and municipalities in line with the needs of the refugees via a matching mechanism. This should take into account family backgrounds, language skills and professional qualifications, for example.
EU states that receive a disproportionately high number of refugees as a result of the application of the mass influx directive must receive fair financial support from other states, as provided for in the directive. We oppose
the so-called screening within the sovereign territory. The registration of minors must not lead to a violation of children's rights.
The mass influx directive was a good tool in dealing with the millions of refugees from Ukraine. We want to analyze the experiences of this unbureaucratic and pragmatic approach in detail and develop proposals for asylum policy.
It is unacceptable that individual member states treat refugees so badly that courts consider it unreasonable for them to remain there. Everyone has a fundamental right to be guaranteed a humane minimum standard of living. The Reception Directive ensures that people seeking protection in every Member State are guaranteed living and humane conditions, and standards based on the rule of law must be guaranteed throughout the EU. We are therefore committed to ensuring that the EU Commission and the Council use the instruments available to them to stop the abuse of EU law and the criminalization of humanitarian aid. This also includes freezing EU funds if national governments systematically break EU law. The EU Asylum Agency should support the member states, particularly in asylum procedures, and ensure that asylum applications are processed swiftly in accordance with the rule of law. It can help to prevent congestion.
Ensuring humanity and order at the external borders
The EU is an area of freedom, security and justice. The right to freedom of movement and the dismantling of borders within Europe was and is one of the greatest achievements in bringing the European community together. We therefore reject permanent and stationary internal border controls.
It goes without saying that the EU must control its external borders - and this is not just about migration. For freedom and security at home, we also need to know who is coming to Europe.
The fact that constitutional controls or reliable registration at the external borders have nothing to do with unlawful isolation against asylum seekers can be seen in the movement of refugees from Ukraine. Millions of people are reliably checked but have been able to find protection in the EU. Unfortunately, however, many other asylum seekers do not encounter constitutional controls at EU borders, but rather injustice and violence.
The credibility of European values, and therefore the influence of European policy on the outside world, requires respect for the law and values in our own actions. It is difficult to reconcile this realization with the fact that the European promise of humanity and the rule of law is shattered for thousands of people every year by barbed wire and patrol boats. We oppose violations of the rule of law, freedom of the press and human rights as well as the unlawful push-back of refugees.
People seeking protection in Europe must be reliably registered, provided with initial care and housed in a humane manner. The right to a case- by-case assessment and the principle of non- refoulement apply everywhere and at all times. The asylum applications of people who arrive in the EU or are already here must be examined in Europe. Border procedures must not lead tothe creation of further large detention camps such as Moria at the external borders, which violate the dignity and rights of people seeking protection. We oppose the disenfranchisement of people who are instrumentalized by authoritarian states.
Despite the principles enshrined in international and European law, we repeatedly experience systematic violations of the law at Europe's external borders.
People are subjected to mistreatment, denied access to the asylum procedure or denied the right to asylum.
they are abandoned to their fate in distress at sea. We are committed to ensuring that illegal pushbacks are consistently punished and sanctioned legally and politically. We also want to strengthen the EU Fundamental Rights Agency and further expand the state and civil society human rights monitoring system. An independent
Monitoring with investigative powers at the external borders should be made possible. Aid and human rights organizations as well as lawyers need access to refugees and border regions at all times. Free reporting by journalists must be guaranteed.
Cooperation between the EU and third countries must always be based on fundamental and human rights. We want to finally end cooperation with the Libyan coast guard.
Border controls at the external borders are an EU Community task that should increasingly be carried out by European officials. That is why we want to further develop Frontex in line with the rule of law. This means that Frontex must not participate in operations that violate human rights and must end such operations consistently and promptly, as provided for in the Frontex Regulation. At the same time, Frontex operations must be subject to close parliamentary scrutiny.
We are committedtoensuring that Frontex is better monitored not only by the European Parliament, but also by national parliaments. This also includes access to mission reports. It must become easier to hold Frontex accountable for violations of the law, for example through a separate liability basis.
We stand resolutely by the side of the many committed people who care for and advise refugees. The fact that refugee aid is made more difficult or even punishable in many countries is unacceptable. We want to work to ensure that support for refugees is not hindered, but made possible. We want to ensure that NGOs and lawyers have unhindered access to them in order to carry out their humanitarian work. We must pay particular attention to the needs of particularly vulnerable groups such as women, queer people, children and people with disabilities. This includes safe accommodation as well as trained counseling structures and interpreters. Voluntary counseling structures do important work, especially for vulnerable groups. We want to strengthen them through state and professional support, among other things.
Millions of children are fleeing wars, violence, hunger or political persecution alone or with their parents. We must protect them better from criminal structures. Children must be accommodated and cared for in a child-friendly manner; this applies to all children in Germany as well as at Europe's external borders. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also applies without restriction to refugee children, regardless of where they are. People must not be detained simply because they apply for asylum. Families with children should never be subject to border procedures
and Member States are not obliged to carry out border procedures.
Migration agreements, lane changes and safe returns
All people seeking protection in Europe have a right to fair asylum procedures based on the rule of law. We demand that they have access to independent asylum advice in order to know and assert their rights. Legal recourse against negative decisions must always be open.
At the same time, we know that not all asylum procedures lead to a residence permit. Anyone who has not been granted a residence permit after careful examination of the requirements under asylum and residence law and after exhausting all legal remedies must leave the country quickly - provided there are no obstacles to deportation.
Returns are always associated with particular human hardship. We want voluntary return to take precedence over forced return measures. That is why we are committed to Europe-wide, open-ended and independent return counseling.
It is also clear that people may not be deported to countries where there are reasons of human rights or international law to the contrary. People may only be returned to countries to which the person concerned has a clear connection. It must be ensured that these countries respect the rule of law when dealing with refugees. We continue to support the concept of safe third countries
wrong. The conclusion of migration agreements with countries of origin and transit must be based on human rights, and cooperation with the respective countries must be based on partnership and on an equal footing. It must not be made dependent on financial support as part of development cooperation and should also serve to combat the causes of flight. The agreements should give the population prospects and not strengthen autocratic regimes. Only comprehensive agreements can create acceptance for the agreements, repatriations and orderly and safe migration.
We don't think the concept of safe countries of origin is right because it doesn't solve any problems. What will help isto equip immigration authorities properly, speed up all asylum procedures and improve the quality of decisions. Countries that guarantee their citizens a safe return should be given the prospect of orderly migration, for example through visa facilitation or training partnerships. People who have committed serious crimes must be returned as a priority after serving their sentence.
Many refugees have been living in Europe for a long time, some of them with children born here, are contributing to society and are in employment.
We want to give them better prospects. After all, it is unreasonable for people to have to worry about deportation on a daily basis despite being deeply rooted in European society. On the contrary: we want to recognize the integration achievements and the work of these people.
We therefore advocate a change of track in the European immigration system.
Rescuing people in distress at sea
Every year, thousands of people die trying to cross the Mediterranean. As the EU, it is our duty not to close our eyes to this intolerable situation. No one should have to risk their own life or that of their family and children for the right to seek asylum. We must no longer accept that the Mediterranean remains the deadliest refugee route in the world.
International law obliges us to rescue people in distress at sea. We finally need a European initiative for a state-coordinated and financed sea rescue service.
We also want to improve state support for civilian organizations, including financial support.
Germany's entry into the financial support of private sea rescue NGOs is an important step here. We also want to continue to encourage other EU states to actively support sea rescue. We stand by the sea rescuers who save lives.
All EU Member States are responsible for ensuring that sea rescue organizations can carry out their missions safely. Sea rescue vessels must not be hindered in their work by the authorities and sea rescue must not be criminalized. The
EU Commission should resolutely oppose the criminalization of aid organizations. Rescue ships must have the opportunity to call at the nearest safe port so that people can go ashore and be cared for. The departure of rescue ships must not be hindered. In order to save human lives, we advocate the improvement of state support, including financial support, for civilian organizations. Disembarkation in countries must not take place if rescued persons are at risk of unlawful treatment there. The principle of non- refoulement applies always and everywhere.
Creating safe escape routes
We want to create safe escape routes, because this is how we protect human lives and put a stop to smuggling gangs and human trafficking. In this way, we also protect vulnerable groups who currently have few opportunities to escape.
To this end, we rely on partnership-based and human rights-based migration agreements with countries outside the EU.
We are committed to ensuring that the UNHCR's resettlement program
and strengthen it. In this way, refugees recognized by the United Nations (UN) and in need of special protection can be distributed to the host countries in an orderly manner and in a spirit of solidarity.
We want the share to be based on the economic strength of the countries. The EU resettlement must be based on the UNHCR criteria and must not weaken the individual right to asylum.
By issuing humanitarian visas, we want to ensure that people seeking protection can reach Europe without endangering their lives. As the EU, we have a particular responsibility to
responsibility towards former local forces. We also want to support people who are particularly at risk due to their commitment to democracy, women's rights or human rights. We are therefore committed to strengthening reception programs. We want to enable Afghan women who have fled to third countries and who have been banned from studying in their home country since the Taliban took power to continue their studies with a European scholarship program. We also want to promote such programs for other war and crisis zones in order to provide answers to the increasing dangers for academics and students worldwide. It is important to us to help people in danger, regardless of their citizenship, for example with European scholarship programs for students in danger.
We advocate that refugees should be able to bring their relatives home. Families belong together. At the same time, stable living conditions support integration.
6. A united approach to crime
Strengthening police cooperation
A strong area of freedom and freedom of movement needs effective institutions that protect the law and democracy, and it needs people to be able to act.
who often fulfill this mission at great personal c o s t . Crime takes place across borders and causes enormous damage - it threatens the
individual security of all people, our quality of life and our prosperity. The EU must respond to this: the increasing networking of our society and economy must also be reflected in the cooperation between our security authorities. In a united Europe, modern and effective police and judicial work must take place across borders, ensure the rapid flow of information, be in line with civil liberties and citizens' rights and comply with the rule of law.
operate according to the same standards. We focus on effective prevention, exchange of experience and joint prosecution.
We want to expand the European police authority Europol for this purpose. Europol should have its own operational capabilities for combating terrorism and organized crime (OC).
We are continuing to develop the Europol Information System (EIS) in order to improve data exchange. We are incorporating experience from police IT projects in the member states as well as the role of the judiciary. We want to strengthen the supervision of Europol by the European Parliament in order to ensure transparency. In the future, we want to establish a European Criminal Police Office.
This means that the European police authority Europol, which is currently largely free of powers, will be expanded into a European police force along the lines of the Federal Criminal Police Office with its own investigation teams. In addition to the expansion of Europol, the exchange and networking of European police forces is a key to success: we promote police cooperation by expanding joint investigation teams that work closely together to carry out investigations. The best minds are needed to fight crime successfully. That is why we want Europol and the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) to be able to recruit experts who are not seconded from the police or judicial authorities of the member states. We are expanding joint police centers in border regions at EU level.
We want to strengthen European police work in practice and theory on the basis of the rule of law and science. To this end, we are further promoting and developing exchange programs for police officers - including through the Erasmus+ program. We are strengthening cooperation and research at police colleges and universities and thus promoting a science-based crime policy. We also want to involve third countries in this, particularly with regard to the joint fight against OC and financial crime.
Fighting organized crime
Organized crime harms people across Europe. It costs taxpayers and companies billions. It can undermine democracy and the rule of law.
Examples of this include the assassination of investigative journalists, the infiltration of legal economic sectors and the exertion of political influence through corruption. In this way, the OC damages economically weak regions in Europe in particular and hinders their development. We want to take decisive and joint action against OC organizations. We are paying particular attention to groups such as the mafia. To this end, we are strengthening cross-border cooperation between the criminal police and the judiciary. We want to harmonize European laws to combat OC.
We are taking a closer look at organized white- collar crime, protecting consumers from fraud and companies from unfair competition. We want to consistently fight the various forms of human trafficking and provide special protection for the victims. One of our priorities is the fight against environmental crime and agromafia: the illegal disposal of waste, illegal logging and the trade in questionably produced food cause enormous damage to people and the environment. We will curb the trade in illicit drugs and focus on the entire production and trade chain. We are promoting cross-sector investigations in order to better combat overlaps between OC and other areas of crime such as cybercrime or terrorism.
tion. Sustainable action against criminal activities can only succeed in cooperation with civil society and must focus on prevention. We will therefore support civil society organizations that are committed to combating OC or offer exit programs for members of criminal organizations.
Fighting human trafficking comprehensively
Human trafficking in all its forms is a transnational crime and a violation of human rights. Despite existing EU legislation and obligations of EU member states under international law, the majority of cases of human trafficking are still not effectively investigated or prosecuted. There are many different forms of human trafficking. The most common form is for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Women and girls are particularly affected. Another form is
of labor exploitation and forced labor. Occupational health and safety standards are massively undermined and people are forced into exploitative working conditions. Their living conditions are catastrophic. Exploitation for criminal or degrading activities or even the illegal removal of organs is also part of human trafficking.
Victims of human trafficking need protection, their rights must be strengthened and they need help, including in overcoming the trauma they have suffered. Minors need special attention and protection. We want to strengthen access to information on victims' rights, promote enforcement and ensure good coordination between Member States, public administrations and judicial authorities. The protection of victims must be at the center of our actions. We want to protect victims in the long term through independent, permanent rights of residence and protection programs.
The EU institutions should work towards the proper implementation of the EU Trafficking in Human Beings Directive in the Member States and in doing so
in the best possible way. The member states are required to develop their own action plans for effective
The aim is to design and implement measures to combat human trafficking in order to contribute to better identification of victims and perpetrators and to an improved data situation in the future.
We forge alliances between specialist advice centres, civil society organizations and the private sector. We are committed to training staff who come into contact with victims of human trafficking or who can help to identify perpetrators. Finally, we are strengthening resolute, cross-border cooperation between the relevant law enforcement and investigative authorities in order to combat human trafficking and dismantle criminal networks.
Taking action against money laundering
Money laundering and financial crime cause great financial damage to the state and society. In Germany alone, it is estimated that around 100 billion euros are "laundered" every year. The scandal surrounding Wirecard AG has harmed many thousands of small investors. We want to take decisive action against money laundering and financial crime. We will also target organized tax and subsidy fraud.
Financial investigations often offer initial investigative approaches and can help to deprive criminal groups of their business basis. We therefore want to strengthen instruments to better track financial flows in particular and to detect money laundering and the transfer of assets. For us, one thing is clear: crime must not pay!
We want to develop the new European anti-money laundering authority AMLA into a powerful institution in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. We are pushing for all EU member states to implement European and international standards for combating money laundering at national level without delay. In developing the AMLA, we are also working closely with the private sector, for example to shed light on cryptocurrency trading and take measures. In addition, the automatic exchange of tax information is to be intensified. We are committed to ensuring that international
an anti-money laundering action plan is driven forward at G7 / G20 level. We advocate a European asset register. Authorities across Europe should be allowed to view the beneficial owners of assets that are regularly misused by criminals for money laundering.
We will further restrict loopholes and opportunities to circumvent the transparency registers used to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Access to the transparency registers should be simple, free of charge and anonymous for civil society, journalists, researchers and other groups with a legitimate interest. Real estate must be effectively protected against speculation by illegal money. This is also how we protect tenants. To this end, we will improve transparency regulations and controls on the acquisition of real estate.
We want to improve cross-border cooperation between law enforcement authorities and instruments in the area of asset recovery. It must be easier to confiscate assets of unclear origin in connection withcriminal activities. We will set EU- wide maximum limits for cash in ordertomake the transfer of incriminated funds more difficult. We will strengthen the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in terms of personnel and funding sothat it can take effective action against fraud and corruption offenses, such as the misappropriation of European funding.
Stop terrorism
Terrorist attacks or acts of violence, currently mainly motivated by Islamist and far-right extremists, cause immeasurable human suffering. They are a threat to public safety. In recent years, the cross-border networking of violent groups and actors has increased. The EU can and must make an effective contribution to protection here.
Consistent and well-coordinated police and intelligence cooperation across Europe with uniform rule of law standards and definitions is necessary,
to take action against terror. To this end, we want to upgrade the position of the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator and oblige the member states to engage in more exchange and cooperation.
Good prevention work is the best way to prevent people from slipping into the political violence scene and terrorism. To do this, we need a Europe- wide exchange of experience between democratic forces, which we want to support financially. This includes educational work in schools and youth facilities. We want to establish deradicalization programmes or offers for people leaving the Islamist or right-wing extremist scene throughout the EU. We are closely monitoring the development of other and new forms of extremism, such as the delegitimization of the state relevant to the protection of the constitution. We incorporate findings from research and science into this. Online platforms, online gaming and messengers play an important role in the spread of terrorist propaganda. We want providers of such services to take more decisive action against this and delete the relevant content.
By resolutely combating the financing of terrorism, we want to remove the operational basis for terror. We focus on where terrorist and criminal structures overlap. In this way, we are preventing access to black markets and drying up important sources of finance or making access to weapons more difficult. We are committed to common standards and an intensive exchange in the prosecution of terrorists.
When monitoring potential violent criminals, a uniform approach is needed across Europe so that the security authorities do not lose track of them for administrative reasons. We therefore want to define the term "dangerous person" in a uniform way across the EU in order to ensure that cases are processed across borders.
In the past, serious acts of violence and terrorist attacks have repeatedly shown that firearms or explosive precursors are too easily available. We want to
restrict the availability of illegal firearms and dry up the black market. We want to introduce effective European standards for so-called prima facie weapons, such as collector's items, so that reactivation of the
weapons is no longer possible. Weapons and relevant weapon parts must be fully registered. We advocate common and strict standards for background checks for gun owners. We want to prevent the misuse of explosives precursors through strict monitoring.
Setting up intelligence services effectively
Cross-border terrorism, illegal activities by foreign intelligence services, industrial espionage and disinformation campaigns threaten our liberal and open society. Authoritarian states such as China, Russia and Iran in particular, but also criminal groups, are targeting the entire EU. In some cases, they coordinate their actions in the various member states. Examples of this include the massive spread of fake news - also to influence elections -, attacks on opposition members on EU territory or on our critical infrastructures (KRITIS). We in the EU must stand together and resolutely against this. The intelligence services play an important role in this and are part of a resilient democracy.
We are calling for effective intelligence services based on the rule of law, which will enable us to better guarantee the security of the EU. Up to now, their work has often been hampered by the fact that information and intelligence cannot be shared sufficiently within the existing European structures. We therefore want to establish a European Intelligence Agency (ENA) for better cooperation between European intelligence services, which will further develop the existing European intelligence structures, both civilian and military, on a clear constitutional basis.
It is intended to make knowledge gathered in the Member States
in compliance with strict legal requirements.
to strengthen the European analysis capability. In this way, strategic and long-term security policy assessments can be made. Strong, effective and democratically legitimized mechanisms based on the rule of law are needed to control the agency, which we want to develop with the involvement of the European Parliament.
We want to cooperate more closely in the development of European IT solutions in the area of intelligence services in order to secure digital sovereignty here too. We are committed to ensuring that intelligence service powers are based on clear legal foundations throughout Europe, are appropriately limited and are subject to strong parliamentary control in all member states.
Intelligence activities and instruments must be evaluated and be in line with civil rights. We reject the unlawful sharing of questionably obtained data between intelligence services. Furthermore, we advocate better networking and cooperation between the supervisory authorities of the Member States at European level.
Expanding joint prosecution
Efficient and joint prosecution of criminal offenses requires a uniform European legal framework - this applies to the entire spectrum, from OC to hate crime. To this end, we want to further harmonize criminal law in particular. We want to include hate crime in the list of EU criminal offenses so that
it can be tracked throughout Europe. This also requires uniform Europe-wide monitoring and regular dark field and victimization studies.
In order to enforce the law in Europe, we want to strengthen European structures: we want to improve the staffing and funding of Eurojust and expand the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). In future, it should also be responsible for cross-border cases in the area of terrorism and OC. We want to simplify cross-border criminal proceedings and bundle them in one country so that they can be carried out jointly.
can be conducted. By digitizing cross-border electronic legal transactions while maintaining IT security and data protection, we are creating faster and more efficient judicial cooperation in Europe. We all have a duty to protect children from sexualized violence. This requires structural reforms as well as investments in prevention work and more staff in counseling centers and the police. Instead of monitoring all private chat and messenger messages ("chat control"), we advocate targeted measures.
The focus is on the rights of citizens: We advocate effective legal protection for defendants and defense lawyers. Whistleblowers, witnesses and investigative journalists play a key role in the investigation of criminal offenses and violations of the law.
We therefore want to protect them better. To this end, we are proposing an EU network that offers effective protection across Europe for people involved in the detection and prosecution of criminal offenses. All this should help people to cooperate safely with the justice system in solving crimes. We want to make use of this. In future, the testimony of key witnesses should play a greater role in cross-border prosecutions.
Protecting the population
Natural disasters, serious accidents or humanitarian emergencies: extraordinary emergency situations can turn the lives of thousands of people u p s i d e d o w n and cause enormous environmental damage. Attacks on our critical infrastructure can also have incalculable consequences. They are the lifelines of our modern society. They supply us with
energy or information. Individual member states are quickly o v e r w h e l m e d by threats of this magnitude. The EU can provide practical help through its own resources and coordination - and thus protect security and prosperity on our continent.
We want to improve and combine the physical and digital protection of KRITIS.
We are taking transnational networks more strongly into
the view. We are introducing a mandatory IT vulnerability management system to prevent attacks on digital systems.
The climate crisis threatens to further increase extreme weather events with their sometimes unforeseeable consequences. Strengthening European civil protection can help to reduce damage. We want to further strengthen the European Civil Protection Mechanism and equip it with its own European capabilities. To this end, we initially want to set up a genuine E u r o p e a n fire-fighting aircraft squadron and integrate it into the rescEU reserve. In order to better protect the population and vulnerable groups in particular from extreme heatwaves, we want to support the member states in developing joint heat protection concepts. Europe also needs better preparation for transnational disasters. That is why we want to develop joint plans for risk prevention and management at
and think along with them across all planning
processes. We want to expand population health protection and, for example, capacities to provide assistance in the event of earthquakes or other major emergencies.
7. Digital civil rights
Safeguarding human rights in a digital world
Rapidly advancing digitalization has anenormous impact on theway we live together. That is why we are developing a human rights policy for the digital age based on our values. We want to strengthen the EU as a role model and partner for the rule of law and human rights in a globalized digital world. To this end, we must always consider people's rights when shaping the digital dimension. People have the right to live a self-determined life and not to be taken over by AI or other technologies.
We advocate that the digital space should better reflect our diverse society and that existing discrimination should not be transferred to the digital space.
is transferred. We promote consistent action against discrimination and the active participation of women in shaping digitalization. We want to strengthen the international legal framework for the digital space and be guided by the model of a free, open, global and secure internet.
We therefore reject instruments of mass surveillance. These include, for example, the unprovoked retention of pri- vate data or chat control, biometric facial recognition and the monitoring of behavior or emotions. In particular, we reject AI-supported technologies for the recognition of emotions or the attribution of sometimes highly personal characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, political or trade union affiliation, also due to the potential impact on already marginalized groups. However, research and the use of emotion recognition in particular to provide support in the medical and social fields should not be affected by this. We want to strengthen and expand the right to digital privacy, secure communication and end-to-end encryption. We want to protect the anonymous use of the internet. Particular attention should be paid to ease of use by users. This is particularly important for free press reporting or for the work of opposition forces in authoritarian countries.
We clearly oppose the processing of comprehensive passenger data without cause and the expansion of corresponding systems to other sectors. Spyware is also used in the EU, which deeply invades privacy. We want to regulate the use of spyware more strictly and strengthen parliamentary oversight. Stronger action must be taken against misuse, for example to monitor journalists or public prosecutors.
Not everyone has the opportunity to make full use of digital services. Even though digitalization is advancing at a rapid pace, we are committed to ensuring that services that are necessary for participation in society are available to everyone.
The same applies to all other services that are necessary, such as doctors, authorities, banks or local publictransport, which remain accessible without additional costs.
Tackling hate and disinformation online
Access to reliable information and news is a prerequisite for democracy. Today, social media and other modern communication platforms make it possible for information and news to be prepared and discussed in a wide variety of ways.
Propaganda campaigns jeopardize the democratic formation of opinion. Elections and other opinion-forming processes as well as trust in our democratic institutions are being deliberately undermined by means of disinformation.
be influenced. We are resolutely opposed to this, for example with measures to strengthen media competence or the promotion of fact-checking platforms. We want to examine the possible inclusion of systematic disinformation in the catalog of EU criminal offenses. We also advocate theconsistent enforcement of sanctions against propaganda platforms that deliberately spread disinformation, such as Russia Today. We want regular, Europe-wide situation reports on disinformation to be drawn up in order to create the basis for an effective fight against it.
Hate, incitement and disinformation are deliberately attacking open debate in these places. Open misogyny is used in an attempt to force women out of the digital space. The instruments for combating violence against women as well as hate and incitement to hatred must be applied consistently. Stronger action must be taken against the publication of nude images without the consent of those affected. Algorithms and targeting on dominant digital platforms make a significant contribution to this byincreasing the spread of hate messages and disinformation. As a result, people affected by hate speech often withdraw or restrict their expression of opinion - to the detriment of democratic debate.
We are targeting the algorithmic amplification of hate and hate speech. Hate speech must be deleted consistently and accounts spreading it must be blocked. We are committed to fast and simple procedures. With the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), we have laid the foundations in Europe for countering hate speech with user rights, transparency and clear rules, creating a more democratic internet and restoring competition. These rules must now be consistently enforced and further developed in Germany and Europe. Hate and disinformation must not be a profitable business model. We want to examine measures to dry up such business models, for example by skimming off the profits generated by them.
Civil society organizations must be able to support people affected by hate and hate speech more easily in exercising their rights. To this end, we also want a Europe-wide
Establish victim counseling and low-threshold offers of help. Civil society organizations should be allowed to represent victims in proceedings or take action on their own initiative in cases of incitement to hatred.
We want to support the establishment of special units within the police and public prosecutor's offices in the member states. The consistent enforcement of criminal law can also be supported by the legally secured automated detection of criminally relevant material, such as hate posts, which is then checked by the investigating authorities. Euro- pol should take action against Europe-wide networks that specifically spread hate and hate speech online.
At the same time, traditional media can also play an important role in the spread of disinformation if, for example, they take information from social media without verification or even actively contribute to the spread of misinformation themselves. The dissemination of high-quality fake videos, so-called deepfakes, or AI-manipulated
Images make disinformation appear even more credible and are difficult for many people to recognize. This is why we have successfully anchored the adequate labeling of deepfakes in the AI Act. An important building block in the fight against disinformation in a democracy lies in strengthening information literacy so that people can better recognize disinformation.
So-called social bots, which automatically distribute content on social media, must be labeled accordingly and thus be distinguishable from human users.
Protecting Europe's IT
As our digital infrastructure plays an increasingly important role in our coexistence, its protection is of great importance. However, the best protection against cybercrime lies in the prevention and resilience of digital systems. We ensure that high IT security requirements are consistently established in digital products, services and processes. We are committed to the swift implementation of the updated EU directive on cyber security in order to establish an EU-wide level of security. In order to make the security of IT products transparent for consumers and increase the level of IT security in the private sector, we want to examine the introduction of an IT security label at European level. We want to strengthen European cooperation in the area of cyber security.
security and are committed to a common
European security architecture. We are further developing the European Union Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA), the work of the European Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ICAC) and the foreign policy instrument of the "Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox" for this purpose.
Cyberspace is increasingly becoming the scene of wars and conflicts. We can see this clearly in Ukraine, where Russia's military aggression is being accompanied by cyber operations.
Cyberattacks, for example on digital electoral and administrative systems, are also a threat to our democracy and security. We are committed to
a norm- and rule-based cyberspace characterized by diplomacy and international cooperation. At the same time, cyber security goes hand in hand with digital sovereignty. We want to expand competencies in the EU in this area.
We want to create the legal and technical framework for secure "digital embassies" in Europe. This should enable state and publicly relevant databases and technical infrastructures in other European member states to be kept secure in ordertoenablethe ability to work and access to data, for example from parliaments, public administration, the judiciary or social insurance, even in crisis and war situations.
The rapid pace of digitalization and the increase in digital services have also led to a shift of crimes to the internet. Law enforcement must respond to this, especially at a European level, because cybercrime, like the internet, knows no borders.
To this end, we are strengthening Europol's role in the fight against online crime. We are also strengthening Europe-wide police cooperation to detect and combat crime. We are also taking decisive action against the spread of sexualized violence against children and young people online by strengthening the investigative authorities in terms of personnel, technology and procedural law. To this end, we also want to use the possibility of automated applications to support investigations. We want to use targeted campaigns to raise citizens' awareness of fraudulent crimes that are committed online.

Program for the 2024 European elections
Preamble
An independent Europe of sovereign democracies - peaceful and just!
The world around us is in the stranglehold of war and violence. We are living in a time of the most, most intense and longest-lasting armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War. More and more attempts are being made to resolve conflicts through armed violence or the threat of violence. Global military spending has more than doubled since 1990 and continues to rise - especially in the countries of the European Union.
Europe is surrounded and affected by numerous armed conflicts. For two years now, the largest and most dangerous war on European soil since the Second World War has been raging in Ukraine. In a world of violence and the threat of a new bloc confrontation, Europe will be the loser due to its geographic location and its dependence on raw materials, energy sources and export markets.
The mistaken belief that only weapons and highly equipped armies can resolve conflicts has also taken hold within the leadership of the European Union and in many member states. The language of war is once again prevalent in Europe, and security is sought solely in military armament.
Peaceful solutions through diplomacy and reconciliation of interests are being blocked. We want to change this by turning Europe back into the peace project it was once conceived as.
We also need peace in Europe in order to promote our own interests in the world, to safeguard our prosperity and our social achievements.
We need to protect the world's natural resources, to defend our democracy and our constitutional system and to avoid weakening our economy by imposing sanctions, making energy and raw materials more expensive and cutting off trade with the growth markets of Asia. We will only overcome the problems arising from global climate change through peace and international cooperation.
The European idea of peace, prosperity, social security and freedom was at the beginning of European unification. Many people committed themselves to this idea after the Second World War. They wanted to leave the horrors of war, nationalism and tyranny behind them forever and set out for a better future. They reflected on the common European traditions: Democracy, enlightenment, solidarity. In the decades following the Second World War, people in Western Europe moved closer together: when traveling, studying or at work. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, millions of Eastern Europeans joined them. For decades, this development went hand in hand with increased cooperation and integration - from the coal and steel union to the founding of the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Union (EU). Although the integration process was never without conflict, Europe experienced decades of prosperity and peace in the post- war period.
Today, the limits of political integration are becoming apparent. Crises have become the norm in European politics. The EU today - countless unfulfilled promises, endless Sunday speeches, lots of fine words. And many problems. When Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and her
colleagues talk about prosperity, peace and solidarity, the citizens know that the reality
 
looks different. The EU in its current constitution is damaging the European idea.
Many European countries have lost important parts of their industry in recent years, and Europe's share of the global economy and world trade is shrinking. We are not only falling behind in comparison to the growth regions of South East Asia, but for some time now also in comparison to the USA. The once strong European welfare states have been replaced in most countries by an Anglo-Saxon Blackrock capitalism, which is controlled by large financial and digital corporations and dominated by listed companies, and in which small and medium- sized enterprises and employees are falling by the wayside. The European Union has not opposed this process, but has promoted and actively driven it forward.
The promise of social advancement is no longer being kept: While one in four children in the EU today grows up in poverty and more and more employees are no longer achieving a solid level of prosperity despite having a full- time job, the wealth of a narrow upper class is increasing. Many people now experience the Europe of the Brussels institutions less as a gain in personal freedom than as a freedom for multinational companies to outbid regional suppliers and to fuel competition for the lowest wages and worst working conditions. School exchanges and semesters abroad, which could be fundamental not only for language learning but also for a common European identity, are often only affordable with the support of financially strong parents and are therefore increasingly a privilege of the better-off. Even the unlimited freedom to travel is of little use to those who can barely afford a vacation.
Instead of successful European cooperation, citizens and companies are now experiencing a Kafkaesque proliferation of EU regulations and reporting obligations that benefit the influential lobbies in Brussels and are particularly harmful to SMEs. They feel the pressure to
Privatization of public services and attacks on services of general interest in cities and municipalities, which are finding it increasingly difficult to support regional providers or offer public services at low cost. Many people rightly perceive the aloof policies of distant, democratically barely controlled EU technocrats as an attack on democracy and a threat to their culture and identity.
The integration of Europe towards a supranational unitary state has proven to be an aberration that divides rather than unites Europe. Instead of more common ground and major European answers to the problems of our time, the centralization of decision-making powers in Brussels has led to growing tensions and conflicts that hinder a coordinated approach. This is also due to the fact that the EU has become more diverse with each step towards enlargement. The likelihood of being able to agree on common goals is thus becoming ever smaller, and the attempt to impose a policy on countries by majority vote that is not accepted locally generates rejection and hostility and usually fails in the end anyway. As the growing number of unresolved problems shows, the European unification process is at a dead end. Endless consultations and negotiations are increasingly resulting not in tangible improvements for the citizens of the EU, but in powerless formulaic compromises.
The lowest common denominator is often worse
than ambitious national regulations.
The increasing European inability to act together is a serious problem. From digitalization to climate and environmental protection to sensible financial market regulation, from an independent European foreign policy to a response to the increasing conflicts in the world, we urgently need concepts that are at least jointly supported by a larger number of European countries. Among the major tasks awaiting a solution,
 
This includes a European digital strategy that makes us just as independent of the US data octopuses as we are of Chinese IT equipment suppliers.
This includes a European payment system that enables European sovereignty in the face of Washington's threats of sanctions. We need a re-industrialization of Europe that brings back jobs and prosperity instead of an energy and sanctions policy that sets Europe back further and leads to Europeans being crushed in the major conflict between the USA and China. A common European environmental, climate and technology policy and a coordinated tax policy that puts a stop to corporate tax dumping would be helpful. All of this must no longer fail due to European disagreement, but should be implemented jointly by those countries that can agree on common solutions.
Our goal is a self-confident Europe of sovereign democracies that comes together not through the centralization of power at the EU Commission, but through equal cooperation, joint economic projects, a single market with fair rules and cultural exchange. We are convinced that more European unity, better European cooperation and more common European solutions can ultimately be achieved in this way than through political integration.
Less is more. For a Europe that does its job!
We will pursue the following goals in the European Parliament:
? We are committed to a new pan-European peace and security order in order to build a
common European home. Immediately after the end of the Cold War, all European states as well as the USA and Canada made a contractual commitment to this in the Charter of Paris! Europe needs to reorganize its foreign and
Security policy should once again be based on the principles of diplomacy, conflict avoidance and good neighborliness and strive for disarmament and new arms control agreements. As a first step, we want the war in Ukraine to end as quickly as possible with a ceasefire and the start of constructive peace negotiations.
? We want to help the European Union to reflect on its political, economic and
security policy independence and thus primarily represent the interests of the citizens of the member states of the Union. Europe must become an independent player on the world stage instead of being a pawn in the conflict between the great powers and subordinating itself to the interests of the USA. A multipolar world is in Europe's interest; a new bloc confrontation with increasing trade restrictions and escalating economic sanctions is detrimental to Europe. We want to dismantle sanctions, open up access to The European Union must enable access to the raw materials and energy sources of Russia and Central Asia and keep overland trade routes to the growth regions of Asia open. Europe must also no longer be a digital colony of the United States, but must build an independent digital infrastructure that protects citizens from surveillance and manipulation.
? We want a strong, innovative and socially responsible European economy.
The EU should secure its economic and industrial base through good framework conditions and joint projects for the future, guarantee budgetary, social and economic sovereignty to the nation states, ensure fair competition in the internal market, limit the power of
Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Finance and other multinational corporations and protect SMEs from ruinous tax competition and over- regulation.
We need an EU that is an efficient
 
public services of general interest and high social standards. Collective agreements and local wages must be defended against low- cost competition in all EU countries.
Imports from third countries that seek to gain competitive advantages through tax, social and environmental dumping should be subject to appropriate import tariffs. A fair global division of labor must be developed that offers the countries of the global South a perspective.
? We want to advance climate policy and environmental protection through
technological innovation, public funding and sensible incentives and not by making people's lives more expensive or destroying and driving key industries out of Europe. Longer
Guarantee periods to prevent products with deliberately short life cycles do more for the environment and climate than high CO2 taxes, which can simply be passed on to consumers if there is a lack of competition. High-speed routes between European capitals promote mobility and European cohesion as well as climate protection.
Instead of banning combustion cars, which will nevertheless be on the roads in increasing numbers outside the EU, requirements to develop more fuel-efficient models or affordable climate-neutral fuels would be a far more sensible strategy, especially as this would ensure the continued existence of an important domestic industry with unique expertise and hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs.
? We want to stop uncontrolled migration to the EU, put a stop to the smuggling
gangs and create prospects in the home countries. It must not be left to criminal trafficking gangs to
who gets access to the EU: The asylum and examination procedures for the protection
status should therefore take place at the EU's external borders or in third countries. This is
to ensure humane conditions, especially for children. Those who do not receive protection status there are also not entitled to access to the EU, a work permit or social benefits, such as citizens' benefits, in an EU member state.
At the same time, the EU has a responsibility to help fight the causes of flight and migration.
? We want the European idea to regain its
credibility.	This	requires	European
institutions that
Protect democracy, justice, freedom of opinion and the rule of law instead of undermining them. Europe must no longer be the Eldorado of lobbyists who make backroom deals with an ever-growing EU bureaucracy below the radar of public perception and without democratic legitimacy. We want to stop the flood of bureaucratic encroachments on companies and citizens, prevent encroachments on the interests of the Member States and roll back interventions in freedom of opinion, especially on social platforms. A voice for the
"Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht - Reason and Justice" in the elections to the European Parliament is a vote for a better Europe and a red card for the traffic lights in Germany: for economic reason, social justice, peace, freedom of expression and democracy.
1. Economic reason
For an economy with a future
Europe is in danger of falling behind economically. A lack of investment in the future, high energy costs, a high dependency on resources, dilapidated infrastructure, a shortage of skilled workers coupled with high unemployment in many places and excessive bureaucracy are damaging Europe. The economic region, which just a few years ago produced almost half of all semiconductors manufactured worldwide, can no longer keep pace with the USA and Asia in this key area.
 
hold. We are falling further and further behind in the promotion of green and digital technologies. The deindustrialization of Europe accelerated with the euro crisis, which resulted in a massive slump in public and private investment and consumer demand.
The EU economic sanctions have hardly affected Russia and have not stopped the war in Ukraine. But they have caused massive damage to the European economy and reduced its competitiveness. Germany in particular is threatened with the loss of important industries and hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs.
The framework conditions must be changed so that the member states can promote investments to strengthen their industrial base, (re)acquire production capacities and develop key technologies. In this context, it is important to fundamentally correct EU state aid and procurement policy, which massively restricts the Member States' ability to act, an innovative state and an active industrial policy.
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the driving force behind the European and especially the German economy. Above all, they need planning security, a crisis-proof, affordable energy supply and protection from market-dominating corporations. SMEs without their own legal department in particular groan under the increasingly confusing regulatory jungle of EU legislation, national regulations and endless application forms for EU or national subsidies. Public procurement law also puts SMEs at a disadvantage compared to multinational corporations due to EU-wide tendering obligations and complicated procurement guidelines. It also reduces the opportunities for local authorities and other state bodies to strengthen regional companies and economic cycles and set high social and ecological standards through public procurement.
What we want:
? A transnational European cooperation for future investments in innovation and
modern infrastructure and the promotion of innovative key technologies for a climate- neutral, environmentally friendly economy.
? Support for small and medium-sized companies, including through a stricter
antitrust policy that defends fair competition and pushes back the big tech companies, as well as through the creation of an independent European digital infrastructure.
? Municipal contracts to regional companies. This requires a fundamental reform of
public procurement law, which in particular substantially increases the threshold values for services and construction contracts, so that municipalities and other public bodies can award contracts to regional companies. contracts do not have to be put out to tender EU-wide. EU and national procurement procedures must be simplified and the scope for public contracting authorities must be increased, above all by upgrading social criteria, as the cheapest offer is often not the best.
? EU state aid law must be radically reformed. In the short term, existing state aid rules
should be strengthened and, in the long term, the ban on state aid in the EU treaties should be restricted to extreme subsidy competition or discrimination in the internal market that cannot be justified by the general interest.
For more investment and tax justice in the EU
The ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court in November 2023 on the Climate and Transformation Fund (CTF) has caused a budget crisis in Germany - and put the discussion about the debt brake back on the agenda. Less
 
It is well known that the EU treaties also provide for a kind of debt brake in the form of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP):
The SGP stipulates strict upper limits for government debt (60 percent of gross domestic product, GDP) and annual net borrowing (3 percent of GDP). As a result of the euro crisis, the SGP has been supplemented by a complex set of rules for economic and budgetary surveillance in the EU.
EU and eurozone, which, among other things, requires highly indebted countries to reduce their debt by 5 percent annually and forces them to make socially and economically damaging cuts. In addition, the EU Commission ensured that the process
The European Semester has a considerable influence on the design of national budgetary policy.
Economists and trade unions have been calling for comprehensive reforms to EU fiscal rules for years: EU debt rules do not put the brakes on debt, but on investment. Germany and Europe must return to the golden rule, which allows loans to the extent of investments and establish a common definition of investments. It is no coincidence that the debt ratios in the EU and eurozone in 2019 were still above the 2008 level after a decade of cuts. This is because cutting government spending prevents debt reduction if it also stifles the economy.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the application of the SGP's debt and deficit rules was suspended in order to give EU countries the financial leeway to support their economies and maintain social benefits. This derogation was extended during the war in Ukraine to allow countries to cope with soaring energy prices.
and economic losses due to the war and the EU sanctions regime. As a result of these measures, debt levels rose sharply once again.
During the euro crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic and the first months of the war in Ukraine, the European Central Bank (ECB) took countermeasures with an expansive monetary policy in order to maintain the solvency of the hard-hit euro countries and prevent the eurozone from breaking apart. It lowered key interest rates and launched multi-billion euro purchase programs for government bonds, and later also for corporate bonds, in order to support southern European euro countries in particular. This prevented sovereign defaults and an unchecked slide into recession.
However, the low interest rate policy and bond purchases accelerated asset concentration and contributed to the formation of bubbles on the stock and real estate markets.
The ECB responded to inflation caused by broken value chains and escalating energy sanctions by raising interest rates. However, rising interest rates with little or no growth make investments more expensive, make housing construction more difficult, encourage company bankruptcies and are not a suitable means of combating inflation driven by sanction-related shortages and the excessive market power of a few suppliers. Investments in energy capacities, selective price caps and a tightening of antitrust law would be more effective, as has been successfully practiced in the USA, China, Japan and individual EU countries.
Monetary policy alone is not enough to combat inflation. In addition to abandoning a ruinous sanctions policy, this requires
1) Public investments that expand the economic potential of the national economy
2) Targeted credit control by the ECB to combat price bubbles on individual markets
3) the strengthening of antitrust law and price caps on individual markets.
What we want:
? A reform of the rigid rules of the European debt brake. An important
 
One step would be the introduction of a "golden investment rule". This would exclude public investments to modernize infrastructure, strengthen public services and promote future technologies from the deficit calculation.
? The abolition of the "European Semester", which allows the EU Commission to direct
the member states. Economic policy coordination in the EU makes sense in order to reduce imbalances in foreign trade, for example. However, the existing rules mean that the budgetary rights of democratically elected parliaments are overridden.
? A European corporate taxation system that is as uniform as possible, prevents tax
competition between member states and protects SMEs from tax dumping by corporations, creates a common, broad definition of corporate profits, dries up tax havens and enforces international cooperation through punitive taxes on financial flows in tax havens.
? A split-up of megabanks to separate investment banking from the lending and
deposit business. Shadow banks should generally be organized at the level of
be regulated by banks. This also includes the new generation of shadow banks (big tech companies and FinTechs), whose increasing market power in payment transactions must be combated. Cash must be protected.
For a reorientation of the EU budget
The EU has its own budget, predominantly financed by contributions from EU member states, which it can use to pay for political measures to promote EU integration. Over the past ten years, the "catalog" of objectives and measures financed from the EU budget has been expanded.
Among other things, the budget is used to finance EU-wide research and exchange programs such as "Horizon" or "Erasmus" and cross-border investments - for example in the expansion of European transport networks. The largest budget item to date is that for financing the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The second largest budget item is made up of the various EU structural and regional funds, which are intended to promote the harmonization of living conditions in the Union and regional development in structurally weak regions.
Increasingly, EU budget funds are also intended to support the environmentally friendly restructuring of the economy and the achievement of climate targets as well as digitalization measures.
The current seven-year budget cycle from 2021 to 2027 comprises a volume of around one trillion euros. In addition to this regular budget, the EU manages the time-limited "reconstruction instrument" Next Generation EU, which was launched in 2021 to overcome the socio-economic consequences of the
Covid-19 crisis and to promote the "green transition" and digitalization and was endowed with a further 800 billion euros. The Commission, the EU Parliament and politicians, particularly from the left-liberal spectrum, are calling for ever higher EU budgets. In addition, the EU is to be strengthened through the introduction of new sources of revenue, such as income from the
emissions trading, corporate taxation or the CO2 border adjustment system will receive more money and greater independence from the EU Member States' contributions to the EU budget.
We expressly do not share this position! Transferring more and more money to Brussels is the wrong way to go. Instead, EU member states should be given more leeway to invest by reforming the "European debt brake". A fundamental correction is needed to the EU budget system, which has become increasingly complicated over decades and has entrenched structural problems.
 
The EU budget process is characterized by intransparency. The parliaments and the public of the member states have little insight into and influence over the deals that governments conclude with the Commission and the EU Parliament in negotiations that often last for years. In central areas - such as structural and regional policy - the Commission has acquired considerable powers in the design and control of EU funding programs and exerts massive influence on the local policies of the member states. Last but not least, every year billions flow from EU funds into opaque projects that make companies with strong lobbies and influence rich, or they are spent on nonsensical and sometimes harmful things.
One example of this is the new "Security and defence" budget heading introduced in 2021, under which the EU finances the development of military structures and subsidizes the European arms industry.
What we want:
? No further increases in the EU budget.
The budget procedure must be reformed,
negotiations must be conducted more transparently and the national parliaments' ability to exert influence must be increased.
? We reject the introduction of new own resources. The EU - and the Commission
in particular - must not gain even more political influence over the member states.
? The EU budget must be used for sensible goals and measures, such as those that
promote cross-border cooperation between member states in the areas of research, transport or infrastructure development.
? The EU's structural and regional funding must be fundamentally
realigned: Despite billions of euros being disbursed via the various EU funds
The main objective of visibly reducing regional economic and social disparities has hardly been achieved. The EU structural and regional funds cannot replace national structural policy and cannot fill the gaps that have arisen in many cases as a result of the cutback policy. National funding programs must therefore be increased. With reformed and investment-friendly EU fiscal rules, a new law on awarding grants and state aid that enables local structural support, the
EU Member States the scope for a policy that is precisely tailored to local needs.
For a sensible energy policy and climate protection
Developing new technologies that can help combat climate change is one of our strongest skills. It would make sense to support companies across the EU in developing innovative products and creating sustainable jobs.
The "Green New Deal" announced by Ursula von der Leyen when she took office and its follow-up programs, on the other hand, are shaped by lobby interests, ill-conceived, poorly executed and in many cases harmful to the climate.
LNG imports counteracted. The EU's so-called "green taxonomy" is also primarily a bureaucratic regulatory monster that imposes useless reporting obligations on the productive economy and thus harms SMEs in particular. Ultimately, this fraudulent labeling is also primarily the result of successful lobbying, in this case by the financial sector, which would like to sell funds with a supposedly green seal of approval to its wealthy clientele.
In many areas, the EU's actual policy contradicts the concerns of climate and environmental protection.
 
This also applies to extreme upgrading, considering that a fighter jet causes more climate-damaging emissions in one hour than a normal car driver does in 17 years. In addition, there is still no serious consumer protection for high quality standards and against deliberate product deterioration through the installation of wearing parts (planned obsolescence),
which has contributed significantly to the mountains of plastic waste that have been growing globally for years. The current regulations against plastic packaging are also largely ineffective.
The EU's latest energy policy decisions, which aim to replace pipeline natural gas with liquefied natural gas from fracking and pipeline oil with marine oil with long transport routes, are ludicrous in terms of both economic and climate policy.
The EU economic sanctions against Russia are not helping to end the war in Ukraine. Rather, after almost two years, it is clear that they are harming Germany and Europe in particular. The German economy is coming under pressure due to the increased costs resulting from the energy sanctions and is suffering massive competitive disadvantages. The Russian economy, on the other hand, is growing, Russian raw materials and energy sources are in demand worldwide and Russian income from foreign trade is high due to higher prices.
If European countries do not want to rely on nuclear power, they need gas as a bridging technology for the energy transition. Currently and in the near future, the energy requirements of a Central European economy cannot be covered by renewable energies alone. The import of expensive liquid gas has driven up gas prices in Germany and, as gas is also used to generate electricity, expensive gas also contributes to the rise in electricity prices. This effect is reinforced by the fact that the EU has liberalized the electricity market and electricity is traded on the exchange. The most expensive power plant that is still needed to meet demand sets the price. We want to change this.
The energy supply must be affordable
and as part of public services of general interest. CO2 certificates are also traded on exchanges such as the European Energy Exchange. This certificate trading is completely unsuitable for achieving climate policy goals.
Due to the strong price fluctuations, it offers no long-term planning security for companies to invest in low-emission alternatives. In addition, the securities are an attractive object of speculation that can be used to artificially drive up prices. There is no discernible steering effect: Even if fuel for the car becomes more and more expensive, people will not be able to leave it behind as long as there are no suitable alternatives. The attempt to "re-educate" people by making their lives more expensive before inexpensive, reliable and comprehensive alternatives are even available is detrimental to the acceptance of climate protection. We call for the expansion of local and long-distance public transport and the promotion of low- emission production chains. An EU-wide program for the expansion and renovation of public infrastructure and buildings, in combination with a purchase guarantee for green steel produced in Europe, would be further measures that would boost the economy and help the climate.
One important point is the grid infrastructure of our energy supply: In the course of liberalization, energy networks were privatized in some EU countries, including Germany, and have since been geared towards generating high returns. The grid infrastructure is a natural monopoly, as there cannot be any number of grids and market-based competition is not possible. By increasing grid fees, companies secure profits and make energy more expensive for consumers. In Germany,	grid fees now account for a quarter of the electricity price, and the guaranteed return on equity for grid operators has just been increased to 7 percent. We can and should save ourselves these additional costs; the grids belong in public hands.
 
The use of existing infrastructure makes sense in terms of energy and climate policy. A hydrogen infrastructure needs to be established throughout the EU. The expansion of gas-fired power plant capacities that can be converted to use green hydrogen is also necessary. In future, these power plants could secure the energy supply at times when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining. The same applies to technologies such as thermal storage power plants, which allow the majority of the coal-fired power plant infrastructure to continue to be used.
This means that it is not necessary to build completely new power plants, but to convert existing ones, and jobs in the affected regions can be preserved.
We must bring future industries back to Europe. The fact that Germany and the EU have allowed once large industries, such as the solar industry with tens of thousands of jobs, to migrate to Asia is a failure of industrial policy.
Innovation and the production of renewable energies must once again take place in Europe.
We want to exploit the high potential of citizen energy and municipal utilities and promote an energy supply that is independent of the large energy companies. Many private households, medium-sized companies, schools and municipal facilities want to generate electricity with their own solar systems,
use it locally and share it with other people. They often fail due to bureaucratic hurdles or financial outlays,
that they cannot afford. We want to support local and decentralized energy supply and strengthen cooperatives that plan and coordinate community-based energy projects.
What we want:
? Reducing energy costs and establishing energy security: we want to
reduce the supply of oil and gas from Russia again and long-term
Conclude energy contracts. Buying expensive LNG from fracking gas is not a sensible alternative to pipeline gas in economic, social and climate policy terms.
? A climate, energy and technology policy that reduces greenhouse gases in the transport
sector by setting savings targets that are open to all technologies, instead of making the ecological transition more difficult by phasing out combustion engines and imposing ruinous energy sanctions.
? The generation of sufficient electricity and a moderate electricity price: the
establishment of national tariff regulators to control energy prices. The European
We want to abolish CO2 pricing and CO2 emissions trading, as they are not an effective instrument for more climate protection under the current framework conditions.
? Investments in local public transport and public infrastructure as well as the
active promotion of low-emission technologies.
? The development of a European water economy as the basis for industrial
production and the jobs of the future.
? Promoting the research and development of
storage technologies.
? Support for municipal utilities and community energy projects and the return
of the grid infrastructure to national control. Energy supply is a public service of general interest.
For fair trade
The European Union is dependent on international trade. Germany in particular, as a country with strong exports and few raw materials, needs a foreign trade policy that focuses on stable trade relations with as many partner countries as possible in order to secure its supply of raw materials and inexpensive energy. At the same time, fair global labor
 
Although European and US interests differ, the European Commission and influential EU governments - including the German government - want the EU to stand firmly alongside the US as a junior partner, accepting economic damage. This threatens the EU with being crushed between the competing power blocs. The EU needs good trade relations with both economic powers, the USA and China, and increasingly also India. If it ties itself too closely to the USA, there is a risk of losing its most important trading partner in China. The People's Republic is not only an indispensable supplier of raw materials and primary products, it is also one of the EU's largest sales markets. Participating in the growing trade dispute and the formation of a bloc between the USA and China would have serious consequences for the European and global economy. The EU must not get caught between the two superpowers. It must consciously fulfill its geo- economic task of acting moderately and diplomatically in this conflict.
Trade relations should be equal and fair. EU trade agreements such as the (unconcluded) TTIP agreement with the USA, the EU agreement with Canada (CETA) and the TiSA services agreement have made us aware of the considerable social, ecological and democratic deficits of international trade policy. It is geared towards the interests of multinational corporations and increases injustice and poverty in the Global South. Instead, we want to promote regional markets and food sovereignty. We reject trade agreements that hinder regional integration and the development of local value creation.
What we want: 
? Stable and fair trade relations that secure our supply of raw materials
and low-cost energy and do not take advantage of trading partners.
? A reform of EU trade policy to ensure that trade agreements do not lead to low-cost
competition for European manufacturers due to low social and environmental standards.
? The abolition of corporate lawsuits,
which enable large companies to sue states
before private arbitration tribunals if they believe their profits are at risk.
? Relations between the EU and Latin America on an equal footing: stopping
the Mercosur agreement.
For agriculture that benefits people, animals and the environment
EU agricultural policy must have a stronger national and regional focus. Agriculture serves first and foremost to ensure food security in our own country.
We reject (free) trade agreements such as Mercosur, which include agricultural products that can also be produced in Europe. The same applies to speculation with food and land. Basic necessities of life such as soil and water are not commodities, but public goods. Price stability both
for both farmers and consumers must be achieved by limiting the market power of agricultural and food corporations on the one hand and by imposing protective tariffs on imports of agricultural goods on the other.
We rely on regional economic cycles with short delivery routes. Not only farmers, but everyone working in this sector must be able to make a living from their work. We need more decentralized small and medium-sized enterprises such as dairies, abattoirs and grocery stores. This will not only put farmers on an equal footing with negotiating partners in food processing and sales, but will also help them to make a living from their work.
 
ensures fair prices, but also strengthens rural areas.
The preservation of agricultural land has priority. Farmers must be involved in environmental requirements.
and to find compromises through appropriate transition periods and subsidies. A disaster such as the implementation of the EU Nitrates Directive through fertilizer legislation must be prevented.
What we want:
? An agricultural policy in the interests of
The consumer, which protects our farmers
from large agricultural corporations, is locally oriented and contributes to animal welfare and environmental protection.
? Self-sufficiency and regional production,
processing and marketing with stable prices
for farmers and consumers: Limiting market power, promoting small and medium-sized enterprises with regional roots, reliable origin and regional labeling.
? Ban on speculation in food and land:
Land should
primarily be available to local farmers and must be affordable.
? Food and pesticide safety through transparent, independent procedures
designed to obtain less harmful and affordable products.
? Promotion of animal welfare and environmentally friendly animal
husbandry through land-based husbandry that integrates feed production and manure utilization into regional nutrient cycles, uniform and mandatory animal husbandry labeling, promotion of pasture animal husbandry through support for herd protection measures and promotion of beekeeping.
? 
Appropriate and unbureaucratic promotion of environmentally, soil and
climate-friendly agricultural technologies and cultivation systems
? Rejection of agro-technology,
no patents on life, free reproduction of seeds.
2. Social justice
For less inequality and other EU treaties
Today's EU is a Europe of banks and big business, a Europe in which social inequality is growing, many employees can no longer live well on their income and small and medium- sized enterprises feel let down by politics. Many of the problems are not simply due to individual political mistakes, but are more fundamentally rooted in the EU treaties, which set the framework for EU policy. These treaties are designed to enforce the interests of multinational corporations against small and medium-sized suppliers and employees and to shield the pursuit of the highest returns from (social) state intervention. They thus curtail the ability of national governments and local administrations to support small and medium-sized enterprises or important areas of services of general interest. such as apartments, hospitals or nursing homes homes from being sold off to private investors.
Basic social rights and social progress are being subordinated to the economic freedoms of the single market. The results of this policy are: lower wages, precarious employment, the dismantling of trade union rights and dwindling collective bargaining coverage, poverty, (youth) unemployment and growing inequality. This is exacerbated by the consequences of the free movement of workers within the EU and by models for the posting of workers. Companies use the social and wage gap within the EU to bring cheap labor from poorer countries into the EU.
 
the high-wage countries. This puts pressure on the local workforce.
We want a Europe in which the disintegration of social cohesion is halted and politics is once again geared towards the common good. To achieve this, we need efficient public services of general interest and significantly more investment in education, health and housing. Workers from different EU countries must not be played off against each other: The principle of equal pay for equal work in the same place is indispensable for this because it protects local workforces from dumping and migrant workers from exploitation.
After years of social cuts, the importance of good labor and social systems is once again being discussed in the wake of the multiple crises in the EU. Some progress has been made, for example a directive for European minimum wages and one for better working conditions for platform workers have been implemented. We are calling for the right to general, free debt advice to be enshrined in law in accordance with Art. 36 of the EU Consumer Credit Directive.
Private insolvency proceedings with no prospect of success should be separated from court proceedings.
What we want:
? Social progress instead of social
d u m p i n g : A social progress clause must
be enshrined in the EU treaties, which establishes the primacy of fundamental social rights over internal market freedoms (goods, labor, services and capital). The progress clause secures national scope for action in labor and social policy and gives the member states legal certainty.
? Fair working conditions and wages. The EU minimum wage directive must be
implemented by the end of 2024 at the latest: Minimum wages should reach at least 60 percent of the median wage for full- time employees. In Germany, this would correspond to
minimum wage of 14 euros - and require the minimum wage to be raised in this country. This must be followed by a tightening of the Posting of Workers Directive to ensure fair wage payments and equal working conditions between the posting company and the company in the host country.
? Services of general interest in public hands: We want to strengthen public
services that are geared towards the common good and prevent privatization and Stop the commercialization of existential services such as housing, water and energy supply. Local healthcare and mobility services must also be able to operate free from the pressure to make a profit.
For a fair distribution of wealth and taxation of the super-rich
As a result of global location competition, corporate tax rates have fallen by more than half since the 1980s to their current level of 24%. EU countries such as the Netherlands and Ireland even undercut this level. The OECD's agreement on a minimum tax rate of 15 percent is inadequate and contains numerous loopholes.
Decades of tax cuts for large companies and wealthy individuals as well as the privatization of more and more areas of public services have left their mark: The division of societies into rich and poor is increasing. An extreme concentration of wealth can be observed at the top, while middle and lower population groups have an ever smaller share in society's prosperity. According to the "World Inequality Report 2024", this trend has been accelerating since the 1980s.
However, the concentration of wealth is not only unjust, but also economically damaging. High income inequality reduces domestic demand: those who have less,
 
can buy less, while top incomes are largely saved and flow into the asset markets. And where corporate profits go to shareholders instead of being reinvested, companies' ability to innovate decreases and productivity and technological progress remain at a standstill. the route. What
we want:
? Germany must campaign within the EU for a
minimum tax rate on corporate profits of
25 percent with a uniform, broad tax base in order to
end the dumping race and guarantee secure revenues for the states. Secondly, this gives companies from different countries the same starting conditions.
? In Germany alone, the tax authorities lose around 100 billion euros due to partly legal
tax avoidance and partly illegal tax evasion. Europe should prevent the international shifting of profits to tax havens and tax avoidance. As a first step, the nation states willing to cooperate should adopt punitive taxes on financial flows to tax havens.
? Money laundering, particularly in the real estate sector, must be combated through
an EU-wide linked real estate register and the loopholes in the transparency register of the true owners of letterbox companies must be eliminated.
? The German government must finally push ahead with the introduction of a genuine
financial transaction tax in Europe in a group of willing states in order to restrict speculation such as high-frequency trading and dangerous financial bets with derivatives.
3. 
Peace
For an EU of disarmament and diplomacy
We live in times of war. Global conflicts of interest and violent disputes are on the rise, a global arms race is underway and military spending has reached a new high.
While the world's center of political power is increasingly shifting to Asia and the global South, the rivalry between China and the USA for global supremacy is intensifying. Against this backdrop, tensions and conflicts are likely to increase further in the coming years. The EU Commission and influential EU governments - including the German government - want the EU to stand firmly alongside the USA as a junior partner in these conflicts. As a result, Europe is at risk of being torn between competing power blocs and dragged into wars and conflicts that could be extremely dangerous not only for prosperity, but also for the lives of people in Europe.
Instead of focusing on a foreign policy of peaceful conflict resolution, reconciliation, diplomacy and détente, the EU is also massively arming itself: Since 2014, annual military spending has risen from 162 billion to 214 billion euros. The EU is building up its own military structures and pushing ahead with defense, military and arms policy cooperation and integration. There are now discussions about building up its own nuclear forces.
The war in Ukraine is a bloody proxy war between the USA and Russia.
To this day, there have been no serious efforts by the West to end it through negotiation.
Opportunities to do so, which did exist, were thrown to the wind. As a result, Ukraine's negotiating position has deteriorated significantly. As long as the guns in Ukraine remain silent, this war will continue to cause immeasurable human suffering and cost the European Union billions in arms and military aid.
 
burden other support. And however this war ends, it will leave Europe with a wounded, impoverished, destroyed, depopulating country in its midst.
Against the backdrop of global human challenges such as the fight against hunger, environmental destruction and climate change, a responsible policy that focuses on cooperation and diplomacy instead of armament and military solutions is urgently needed. Instead of trying to instrumentalize the countries of the global South for conflicts or to lecture them morally, it is time for dialogue and cooperation at eye level.
Especially as anything else would harm the West itself and isolate it in the world. The application of double standards when it comes to compliance with international law must be ended. This would allow the EU to act as a credible diplomatic actor in the future and mediate in international conflicts.
What we want:
? A peaceful Europe in a multipolar world:
We call for a policy of détente, reconciliation
of interests and international cooperation and are committed to strengthening the UN and OSCE. Our goal is a new European
peace order, which should also include Russia in the longer term. Peace and security in Europe cannot be guaranteed in a stable and lasting way in conflict with the nuclear power Russia. The EU must not allow itself to be drawn into the conflict between the USA and China, but should pursue the European interest in diverse trade and energy partnerships.
? Disarming instead of arming: At EU level, we advocate the transformation of the
European Defense Agency into a European Agency for Disarmament, Arms Control and Conversion and the withdrawal of American nuclear weapons from EU member states. We oppose the further militarization of the EU.
? 
A dismantling of EU military
s t r u c t u r e s	and instruments: The
military structures built up in recent years, such as PESCO, the European Defense Fund (EDF), the European Peace Facility (EFF) to fund
EU military missions and new instruments for arms procurement such as ASAP, EDIR- PA, EDIP must be dismantled and the financial resources freed up as a result must be used for instruments of civil conflict resolution.
? End the war in Ukraine through negotiations: We call for a ceasefire and the
start of peace negotiations. In order to motivate Russia to enter into negotiations, an immediate stop to all arms exports to Ukraine should be offered in this case. Towards the Ukrainian leadership
further support and the payment of aid funds from the so-called
"Ukraine Facility" should also be made conditional on the willingness to negotiate peace.
? Maintaining the principle of unanimity in the Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP) and the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP): In order to be able to implement EU military missions and sanctions even faster, EU elites and the German government are demanding that these decisions should no longer be taken unanimously in the EU Council, but by majority vote. In addition, efforts are being made to water down the German parliamentary reservation on military deployments (the Bundestag must give its consent before soldiers are sent). We reject this!
? Stop arms exports: Exports of weapons, armaments and weapon parts from the EU to
crises and war zones must be stopped immediately.
 
For a sensible neighborhood policy - solidarity-based cooperation instead of EU enlargement
The accession processes of Albania, Bosnia- Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia have been ongoing for many years. It is still not possible to predict when these countries will actually be able to join the European Union. Negotiations with Turkey, which has had the status of a candidate country for more than 20 years, have been on hold for several years.
Now von der Leyen & Co. are talking about accepting Ukraine into the EU, the poorest country in Europe even before the war, with major democratic deficits and rampant corruption. It was recently decided to start accession talks. Financially, Ukraine's accession would be a bottomless pit, politically it would mean abandoning all claims to the rule of law to which the EU once committed itself. Obviously, economic and social stability in the EU and in Germany, the largest financier of the EU budget, is to be sacrificed for a supposed geo-strategic advantage of the West over Russia.
The EU would also like to admit Moldova and, in the long term, even Georgia for geopolitical reasons. However, all three countries are currently far from fulfilling the European Union's criteria in the areas of rule of law, democracy, human rights, institutional stability and the protection of minorities. The Russian-speaking minority in Ukraine was massively discriminated against even before the Russian army invaded in February 2022. Left-wing, critical parties in particular were banned. In Moldova, too, key rule of law requirements have not been met following the ban on television stations and the banning of an opposition party.
The accession of the five countries of the Western Balkans, Kosovo, Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova would increase the EU budget by
a further 36.7 billion euros. Ukraine alone would account for 26.6 billion of this. German taxpayers would have to pay an additional 9 billion euros a year to finance this, an amount that would be urgently needed in our care facilities or schools!
What we want:
? A moratorium on EU enlargement
and uniform criteria for all countries.
We reject the opening of accession negotiations with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.
? A neighborhood policy that is geared towards peace, the eradication of poverty
and underdevelopment and creates opportunities for international cooperation instead of hasty accession negotiations.
For an EU policy that stops illegal migration and increases prospects in the home countries
War, violence and political persecution are a terrible reality in many countries. It is clear to us that people who are persecuted for political, religious or other reasons and therefore have to flee their home country have a right to asylum.
People fleeing war or group-related violence also need help and safe refuge, preferably as close as possible to their home countries.
According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the number of people seeking protection is growing steadily. 108.4 million people worldwide were on the run in 2022. The EU is also facing a massive increase in refugees and migrants. Tens of thousands of people have died on the dangerous escape routes, especially across the Mediterranean, because they were transported by trafficking organizations in unseaworthy boats or exposed to other life- threatening situations.
 
As understandable as it is that people in Europe are looking for a way out of poverty, underdevelopment and economic misery, it is also clear that migration is not the solution to the problem of poverty and inequality in the world. Even if some people manage to improve their living conditions as a result, this does not apply to the majority of people. In particular, the poorest, who suffer from hunger and do not have the means to flee dangerously, usually do not make it to Europe in the first place. Even if all the inhabitants of the world's slums and slums could flee, poverty would be elsewhere, but not gone.
There is also a right not to have to flee and a duty of these states to guarantee this to their citizens.
We need more honesty in the debate: immigration and the coexistence of different cultures can be an enrichment for the destination countries. However, this only applies as long as local capacities a r e not overstretched and integration is successful. In France and other countries, and to a lesser extent in Germany, Islamist-influenced parallel societies have emerged in recent years as a result of a completely misguided immigration policy, in which law and order only apply to a limited extent, Sharia law is preached a n d children grow up hating Western culture.
The many problems associated with failed integration do not affect the expensive old districts of the big cities or the villa districts, but the poorer districts in the conurbations, where housing, schools and infrastructure are usually not in good condition anyway.
For years, the EU has been haggling over a reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) without really achieving any tangible results: neither in terms of a significant reduction in the number of migrants entering the EU nor in terms of solidarity-based burden- sharing. We call for a fundamental reform of refugee and migration policy.
What we want:
? There must no longer be criminal networks to decide who gets access to
the EU: asylum procedures based on the rule of law at the external borders and in third countries would be
The safest way to open up the path to the EU for those who really need protection, even if they cannot afford to pay the people smugglers, and to spare all those who have no right to asylum and therefore no prospect of staying the life-threatening and expensive journey.
? R e d u c e the causes of flight and migration: To complement a restrictive
migration policy, the EU must tackle the causes of flight and migration. This requires a reorientation of its foreign policy, Economic, trade and development policy to improve the conditions for economic development in the countries of the South.
? In addition, the EU can and must increase its political efforts to resolve wars and
conflicts diplomatically, together with the UN, regional organizations or bilaterally. This also includes ensuring that no weapons are exported from the EU to
crisis regions should no longer be exported and EU countries should no longer take part in wars of intervention. It is no coincidence that a particularly large number of immigrants today come from countries that have been devastated by Western wars and regime change attempts: Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. This is another reason why we reject military interventions that violate international law and have become a major cause of flight, displacement and migration. The war in Ukraine, which has also caused a large movement of refugees, was started militarily by Russia, but it could have been prevented by the West and ended long ago.
 
? This also includes Germany and other EU states stopping their recruitment
programs in countries of the Global South with which they have good relations.
skilled workers to Europe. With this policy, the
EU is systematically creating a brain drain from the countries of origin and depriving them of precisely those key players who are needed locally for economic development.
are needed. The shortage of skilled workers in the EU must primarily be remedied through improved training and appropriate wages.
? Nevertheless, we should contribute to the
qualification and training of people from
poorer countries through international partnerships. Within the framework of limited quotas, people who already have an employment contract and secure financial prospects must be better supported.
Immigrants who have already been well integrated over longer periods of time through language acquisition and work need reliable prospects.
We should not throw a spanner in the works of people who have made an effort.
? The inhumane trafficking of human b e i n g s must be consistently
combated. To this end, cooperation between EU member states and with third countries must be improved and expanded.
? UNHCR figures show that the vast majority of those displaced by war and violence seek
refuge as internally displaced persons or in a neighboring country because they are unable to pay the high sums for smugglers. The EU states have a duty to provide organizations such as the UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations with better financial resources so that they can effectively offer help and protection to people on the ground. Money that is not spent in the affected
countries for refugees and to prevent the causes of flight protects many times more human lives and is far more effective than the expensive reception in the EU.
4. Freedom and democracy
For a Europe of sovereign democracies instead of dirigisme from Brussels
Since the EU treaties came into force, there has been a clear shift of powers away from national governments and parliaments to the EU level. As a result, important political decisions are becoming increasingly distant for citizens and are no longer comprehensible - let alone controllable. The majority of Europeans do not want a further transfer of power to the EU level, which would result in more intransparency and undermine democracy. EU regulations should be limited to problems that cannot be solved at national level.
Cooperation within the EU and the democratic sovereignty of nation states are not mutually exclusive: for example, we need effective minimum taxes to combat corporate tax dumping. This also requires willing states to lead the way and enforce international cooperation through punitive taxes on financial flows in tax havens. In contrast, we need less intervention by the EU through competition law when it comes to public services of general interest in the municipalities.
The EU Commission has the sole right of initiative for EU directives and regulations. It therefore has a lot of power, but is not directly elected by citizens and can hardly be controlled by them. Instead of transparency or proximity to citizens, Brussels politics is characterized by backroom deals, opaque influence in expert committees and a lack of control.
One particularly blatant example was the EU Commission's approach to vaccination.
 
procurement in the Covid-19 pandemic. Commission President von der Leyen negotiated the most extensive of all EU vaccine contracts by text message - worth an estimated 35 billion euros! These contracts are still under lock and key today, even the EU Parliament may only view redacted documents. At the same time, the EU Parliament itself has a massive problem with lobbying, corruption and money laundering, as the recent "Qatar-gate" corruption scandal shows.
Brussels is the European capital of lobbyists. Around 30,000 lobbyists influence the EU institutions here. About
70 percent of them work for large companies and trade associations. Many people in the EU rightly have the impression that Brussels is "far away" and that intransparent decisions are made there against their interests. As more and more power is transferred to the EU level, citizens are losing influence over politics. It is an attack on democracy when Brussels interferes in the formulation of national budgets.
Europe needs better functioning democracies and more citizen participation instead of a growing concentration of power in the hands of Brussels technocrats and bureaucrats. The measures taken after countless scandals to regulate lobbying and corruption are completely inadequate.
What we want:
? Subsidiarity instead of EU centralism:
What can be regulated better and more
democratically at local, regional or national level must not be left to the regulatory frenzy of the EU technocracy. We do not want a further shift of power to the EU level, but the opposite: a
Strengthening the sovereignty of democratically elected national parliaments and governments to shape policy in their countries without dirigiste directives from Brussels.
design. We also advocate the close examination and, if necessary, non- implementation of EU requirements at national level if they are more economically viable.
reason, social justice, peace, democracy and freedom of opinion.
run back.
? Curbing lobbying and corruption: We are in favor of a mandatory lobby register (EU
transparency register) for parliament, Commission and Council. They also demand We need a grace period when switching between politics and business in order to curb the revolving door effect.
? Strengthen fundamental and human rights: We want the EU to accede to the
European Convention on Human Rights. Fundamental social rights must, in accordance with the revised European Social Charter of the Council of Europe, be enforceable by individuals before the European Court of Justice.
For freedom of expression instead of cancel culture
The right to freedom of expression applies in the European Union. It is enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, among other things. However, many people in the EU no longer dare to say what they think openly.
Of course, freedom of opinion has a clearly defined limit, namely where hatred and agitation against individuals or groups of people are spread. Up to this limit, freedom of expression must not be restricted.
For years, however, we have been experiencing an increasing narrowing of the "permissible" corridor of opinion. Morally and emotionally charged, critical voices are defamed, stigmatized and marginalized, creating a pressure to conform that is incompatible with an open, liberal society.
 
With the attitude of a modern ministry of truth, many politicians and journalists or the so-called "fact-checkers" today claim to determine what is right and what is wrong. The cancel culture is becoming increasingly exploratory
The use of such weapons against dissidents has become more and more ruthless, and they have long since had to reckon not only with public pillorying and undignified defamation, but also with de facto bans on appearances or loss of employment.
Social media, which are already controlled by non-transparent algorithms, are also increasingly being placed under political control. The EU's Digital Services Act is by no means primarily aimed at curbing lies, hatred and hate speech online, but also at reducing the reach of positions critical of the government on sensitive topics.
But it is not only free debate that is being limited. In many EU countries, the new political authoritarianism during the coronavirus crisis has gone so far that fundamental freedoms have been arbitrarily restricted by an overbearing state and people have been excluded from all public life because of their personal vaccination decision, even though there was no medical justification for this due to the lack of external protection provided by vaccination.
What we want:
? The protection of press freedom and of journalists and authors: We reject the
planned media freedom law, which puts the "protection of national security" before press freedom and is intended to enable secret services to monitor the press with state trojans.
? Diverse and independent journalism as a prerequisite for democratic opinion-forming
and decision-making. We stand in solidarity with persecuted whistleblowers like Julian Assange. It is not those who uncover war and economic crimes that belong in court, but those who order and commit them. We demand the release of Julian Assange from British custody and his non-extradition to the USA.
? No surveillance and manipulation of people by corporations, secret services and
governments: The Digital Services Act is the state implementation of Cancel Culture
and must be withdrawn. Statements on the internet are censored with the help of the DSA and platform operators are obliged to restrict the dissemination of positions that do not correspond to the mainstream.
It is therefore an attack on the exercise of fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression and is incompatible with the European heritage of the Enlightenment.

For Alliance Germany, the European Union is an indispensable community of states, co- founded and co-shaped by Germany, in the sense of a Europe of nations in unity and diversity.
The Basic Law expressly calls for the creation of a united Europe. Germany has played and continues to play a decisive role in ensuring that this community has brought peace, freedom, democracy, security, prosperity, open borders and markets as well as broad human and scientific exchange to the people and states of Europe over many decades.
Alliance Germany stands by the European values, economic, financial and social order. Only a strong Europe that is accepted and actively shaped by its citizens, regions and member states can credibly represent their interests both internally and externally.
Based on Western values, the EU must serve the interests of its citizens, regions and Member States democratically, transparently, with lean structures and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
To consolidate the credibility and efficiency of the EU, the sovereignty of the individual states must be strengthened again. The competences of the EU institutions must be limited to those tasks that can only be solved jointly by the EU member states, as provided for in the EU treaties.

A EUROPE THAT REMAINS TRUE TO ITS FUNDAMENTAL VALUES
Remain committed in the future to the cultural heritage of the European nations and the Western value system, which is characterized by Christian- Western ethics and the Enlightenment
As a continent with a Christian and Western culture and history, Europe has a common supranational foundation of values.
Human dignity, the free development of personality, freedom of opinion, conscience, faith and religion, equal rights for men and women, the rule of law and other principles guaranteed in the German Basic Law, the European Convention on Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights are its defining framework and must remain so.
The European Union as an alliance of sovereign states at the service of its citizens
Bündnis Deutschland sees the EU not as a federal state, but as a confederation of sovereign states whose development is the responsibility of the member states, i.e. in particular the voters and their parliaments.
The EU must remain committed to the vision of a "Europe of fatherlands and freedom", as called for by French Prime Minister Michel Debré back in 1959.
The EU Commission must follow the political guidelines of the Council, and thus of the Member States, and must not become independent or even a "super-government". The EU must not be overly bureaucratic in its requirements for its member states but, on the contrary, must support them pragmatically, flexibly and promptly as required.
A citizens' Europe must become more tangible for citizens. Bündnis Deutschland also hopes that this will increase voter turnout for the European elections. For example, a petition to the European Parliament must also be discussed in Parliament.
In our view, citizens of Member States should have the possibility of a qualified veto on decisions by Parliament and the Commission via the Committee of the Regions. A decision on this must be made swiftly.
The EU Parliament must become more democratic and more accountable. The European Anti-Fraud and Corruption Office must also take action against
EU officials without them being able to invoke political immunity in an abusive manner.
Consolidation takes precedence over EU expansion
Future enlargements of the EU must first take into account the EU's absorption capacity: Additional states may only be admitted if the internal functioning of the EU is ensured.
Candidate states (currently from South-Eastern or Eastern Europe) must fulfill all EU standards before joining - a legal matter of course that has been undermined too often so far.
First of all, the previous enlargements of the EU must be consolidated and their financing organized. For this reason, we do not see any possibility of new membership of the EU for the next ten years.
A EUROPE WITH EFFICIENT AND DEMOCRATIC STRUCTURES
8	9
As one of Parliament's main tasks is to monitor the Commission and Council, it should meet permanently at their headquarters in Brussels.
A EUROPE THAT RESPECTS THE PRINCIPLE OF 
The EU must cut back on its sprawling bureaucratic structures and learn to
save on itself
The EU's decision-making and administrative structures must continue to develop in the direction of greater transparency, efficiency and democratic participation. The current trend towards ever more over-regulation, regulatory inefficiency, waste of resources and alienation from citizens must be stopped and reduced.
In addition to the central EU institutions (European Parliament, Council, Commission, European Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, European Central Bank), the existing three agencies for foreign and security policy, six executive agencies, three Euratom bodies and 35 decentralized agencies must not continue to grow but, on the contrary, must be gradually reduced and concentrated on necessary core tasks with real added value. It should be possible to close around a third of the agencies and special structures by around 2035.
The army of 60,000 EU civil servants must also not be allowed to continue to grow, but must be visibly reduced, by around 10% within the next EP legislative period and by a further 30% by 2035.
Future EU enlargements should also not lead to a permanent expansion of personnel or structures, but should take place within existing upper limits.
Abolish the second seat of the EU Parliament in Strasbourg
The European Parliament itself can contribute to a significant efficiency gain and achieve a savings effect by discontinuing its "traveling circus" Brussels-Strasbourg, which costs up to 150 million euros and a lot of energy every year.
SUBSIDIARITY
The EU must internalize the principle of subsidiarity
The EU must finally apply the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty consistently, i.e. make as many centralized decisions as necessary and as few as possible: Higher state institutions may only intervene in a regulatory capacity if lower hierarchical levels or local authorities cannot manage a task on their own.
The decisions of nation states must be respected. Their sovereignty is and remains a valuable asset.
Curbing the EU's regulatory frenzy and leaving more room for national or regional regulations
The EU must rein in its overbearing regulatory frenzy and leave more room for national or regional regulations that take local customs and needs into account. Many people feel that regulations made at EU level are alien to their lives, that the scope of the regulations is excessive and that their implementation is too bureaucratic, as was recently demonstrated in the pandemic and migration crisis and in environmental and climate policy.
The credibility and efficiency of the EU require the dismantling of EU regulations that patronize citizens and are distant from the market economy, especially if they go beyond international world market regulations, such as product classification and product labelling ("material consumer protection"), measures to reduce CO2 emissions, etc.
B. expropriation-like building renovation regulations in the "Green Deal"), food standards above international standards ("consumer health protection") or restrictive pesticide, fertilizer and land use regulations for farmers ("environmental protection") .
10	11
All EU regulations, insofar as they are necessary under the principle of subsidiarity, must be realistic, proportionate, reasonable and affordable; they must also not place a greater burden on Germany than on other EU Member States.
Every new bureaucratic EU regulation must entail the deletion of two existing restrictive regulations. New legislation must be limited in time, evaluated and only extended if successful.
A EUROPE OF TRANSPARENCY
Make entries in the EU Transparency Register mandatory and expand the definition of lobby groups
Bündnis Deutschland is calling for the entry in the transparency register to be declared mandatory for the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - and for the plans for the legislative footprint from 2011 to be implemented in the short term. With this legislative footprint, legislative texts will receive an attachment of all lobbyists with whom an MEP has had contact in the course of their work on a law.
In addition, the category of lobbyist groups must be defined more broadly: Associations of all kinds, companies, foundations, expert committees, contract lobbyists, lawyers, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, churches under public law, the press, employers' associations and trade unions must be included.
The Federal Republic of Germany should undertake to adopt this regulation accordingly. The EU member states are free to adopt it.
Report financial flows to NGOs separately
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are dedicated to a wide range of social issues that are not (or cannot be) addressed by political or state actors and are an integral part of society. The results of their actions have a significant influence on democratic decisions, political and economic actors and therefore on all of our lives.
In times of increasing political influence on parliaments and legislation by NGOs, as well as the delegation of primarily governmental tasks to them and their involvement in shaping them, an opaque web of dependencies has emerged. The parliaments and institutions elected by citizens finance these organizations to a considerable extent from taxpayers' money.
Bündnis Deutschland demands the separate disclosure of the allocation of state funds to NGOs in each financial year. This concerns the three institutions European Parliament, Council and Commission. As part of this transparency offensive, NGOs will also be obliged to declare all their sources of funding annually.
The Federal Republic of Germany should undertake to adopt this regulation accordingly. The EU member states are free to adopt it.

The core task of any state authority is to protect its citizens. This applies all the more in today's world characterized by wars, conflicts, terrorism, extremism and natural disasters. Deeper EU-wide cooperation in police, customs and justice is necessary to enable all EU citizens to live in security and freedom.
We want to maintain the cohesion of society within the framework of our legal system and values, reform migration policy and at the same time ensure social acceptance for those genuinely in need of asylum and protection.
We advocate a transparent, sustainable immigration policy at EU and national level that guarantees political asylum (Article 16a of the Basic Law), complies with the commitments made in international agreements such as the Geneva Refugee Convention and offers economic migrants who have entered the country legally a perspective in the interests of the European economy and society (without a legal right to entry).
At the same time, the massive uncontrolled influx of non-EU citizens, which threatens the security, stability, finances and cohesion of European states, must be controlled and limited. The rising crime rate caused by immigrants must be curbed and immigration into our social systems and its exploitation must be prevented.
It is above all the influx of illegal immigrants - mostly abusing the right of asylum - that threatens our society, not the immigration of politically persecuted people and those in need.
We clearly reject illegal migration and a d v o c a t e the common protection of Europe's external borders. A preliminary procedure for checking immigrants is necessary at Europe's external borders in order to prevent the entry of unauthorized persons at an early stage, to relieve the burden on our municipalities and to prevent deportations that would otherwise be necessary.

Germany and the other EU member states must not provide incentives for illegal migration and must work together in solidarity to protect the EU's external borders. Functioning procedures (best practice), such as in Denmark, should become the benchmark for the entire EU. There must be no room for ideology-driven watering down of the agreed measures.
Ultimately, consistent EU border protection enables better integration of legal immigrants and the prevention of abuse of the social systems as well as the formation of parallel societies, including criminal clan structures.
BETTER NETWORKING IN THE INTEREST OF SECURITY
Networking security authorities, facilitating cross-border police work
The internal security of EU member states must be promoted through better networking of security authorities. A Schengen area without permanent stationary border controls must not continue to encourage cross-border gang crime. This requires a considerable improvement in cross-border police and customs cooperation.
Terrorism - prevent, fight, punish
Terrorism threatens us internationally and nationally. European cooperation must be intensified and harmonized in order to counter this threat. The aim must be the consistent expulsion or deportation of people who are proven or almost certainly planning acts with an extremist background.
The examination of whether an immigrant is to be classified as a threat must already take place at Europe's external borders. Delinquent migrants must be sentenced as quickly as possible and deported immediately.
If immediate deportation is not possible, temporary admission to a state reception facility should take place with all legally possible measures. We are calling for the criminal justice system and the administration to be strengthened in order to speed up proceedings and take consistent action against criminals and dangerous individuals.
Enable internal border controls to protect against terrorism and illegal immigration
Threats from terrorism and illegal immigration as well as cross-border gang crime (human trafficking, smuggling/smuggling of human beings, illegal arms and drug trafficking, etc.) make consistent border controls at the EU's external borders absolutely essential in order to restore internal security.
Border controls need a uniform standard, based on the legal provisions of the Geneva Refugee Convention and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which successfully prevents abuse.
Until such a solution is found at Europe's external borders, controls must be reintroduced at Germany's national borders. Anyone wishing to enter as a refugee via the borders of neighboring European countries must be turned back.
Strengthening customs in line with the international model
Alliance Germany will strengthen customs and is in favor of bundling the enforcement areas of customs into a financial police force. This will enable the authority - in line with international standards - to track the flow of illegal money transactions more effectively and efficiently and carry out essential structural investigations in the area of organized crime to protect the European economy.
16	17
FOR A EUROPE-WIDE INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY
Guarantee the political independence of the German judiciary so that the German public prosecutor's office can issue European arrest warrants
Internal security and order require well-trained police forces on the one hand, but also an independent judiciary on the other. It is unacceptable that German public prosecutors are still bound by instructions today.
According to the ECJ, German public prosecutors are not allowed to issue European arrest warrants as there is "no sufficient guarantee of independence [of the judiciary] vis-à-vis the executive" in Germany (ECJ cases C-508/18, C-82/19 PPU, C-509/18).
The German Association of Judges also spoke out in favor of abolishing the power of the Minister of Justice to issue instructions to public prosecutors: "It should be a matter of course for Germany to comply with European judicial standards" and "It is currently unclear how Europe-wide searches can be implemented at all." In the interest of better cooperation between security authorities at European level, efforts should be made to ensure that all member states of the European Union, including Germany, comply with EU judicial standards.
CLEAR RULES AND A SEPARATION OF IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM
Solving the migration issue on a pan-European basis
Europe and Germany have been the preferred destination for millions of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers every year, and not just since 2015. Our capacity to receive and integrate
The potential for migration is already clearly exhausted or overstretched in many places. This results in the need for a limiting and rule-based migration policy.
A coherent concept that is as EU-wide as possible and clear rules for limiting and managing migration and for dealing with the consequences for infrastructure and social cohesion must serve German and EU interests, naturally within the framework of the relevant national and international law.
Clearly separate asylum, flight and immigration
The continuing strong pressure of migration to Europe, and Germany in particular, must be channelled into regulated channels in the interests of social cohesion as well as in the interests of general legal certainty and financial viability.
Control under the rule of law and limiting immigration are important for social acceptance of foreign residents and thus for cohesion and social peace and for curbing extremist tendencies in politics and society.
A distinction must be made between asylum seekers, convention refugees, war and disaster refugees and economic migrants.
The skilled labor immigration law proposed by the traffic light coalition in June 2023 "Changing lanes", which creates the possibility of gaining access with an asylum application and then obtaining a right to stay as a "skilled worker" despite a rejected asylum application, is also the completely wrong signal in terms of European policy in this context and, in a Europe without internal borders, would have negative consequences beyond the borders of the Federal Republic of Germany. The EU must grant refuge to people who are demonstrably exposed to political persecution, temporarily, for as long as the emergency situation requires, with fair burden-sharing within the EU framework. This follows from the provisions of the Basic Law and the Geneva Refugee Convention, to which we are clearly committed.
However, the granting of asylum with the right of residence for politically persecuted persons requires that asylum seekers cooperate in the admission procedure, e.g. by disclosing their identity, and that they integrate into our legal system.
18	19
If they fail to do so, or even commit a crime, their right of residence and protection against refoulement must be revoked, as provided for in the Geneva Refugee Convention.
This must be distinguished from persons who would face serious harm if returned to their home country, for example due to an armed conflict there. According to EU Directive 2011/95, these persons are entitled to "subsidiary protection"; however, they are not covered by asylum law or the Geneva Refugee Convention.
In the interests of effective immigration control and EU burden-sharing, these people seeking protection must be subject to clear regulations, for example on residence restrictions and social benefits.
Immigration due to climate change or for economic reasons (economic migration), on the other hand, must be managed solely in the interests of the receiving countries, as there is no legal entitlement for immigrants to enter, remain or work in the EU.
Foreign skilled workers who are recruited in the interests of the German economy or, for example, the healthcare/nursing services within the framework of an immigration law with clear criteria are granted residence and work permits if there is a need for qualified immigrants who need to be qualified. Foreign skilled workers trained in Germany should be given preferential rights of residence.
If training positions cannot be filled in Germany, immigrants from non-EU countries should also be considered here. This ultimately promotes two goals: If the immigrant wishes to remain in Germany at the end of their training, we will have gained high-caliber young talent who will then contribute to the economic development of our country as skilled workers. However, if they return to their home country at the end of their training, we will have provided important development aid for that country through their training.
In addition, this exchange ensures that no illusions of a land of milk and honey arise, but that a realistic picture of and understanding for Europe also emerges abroad.
Germany and its EU partners must not provide incentives for illegal migration
Financial benefits to asylum seekers or other people in need who have entered the country should be replaced by benefits in kind as far as possible throughout Europe. Bündnis Deutschland would like to lead the way here with Germany. Immigrants must not be treated better than Germans or other EU citizens when it comes to social benefits.
The recognition of a person's asylum or refugee status must not be confused with a legal entitlement to an improvement in their own economic situation. This must also be reflected in the way in which state benefits are granted.
Benefits for migrants must also be harmonized in all member states. Refugees enjoy the protection and helpfulness of the European nations and have a fundamental obligation to reside within the EU.
Furthermore, the standards for the recognition of safe countries of origin should be measured against the living conditions in these countries of origin and not against European standards in order to prevent extraneous incentives. The classification as a war zone should be reviewed annually. Otherwise, return must be initiated.
Implementing effective border protection at European level
Germany, which as a country in the center of Europe - with the exception of entry via airports - is surrounded only by "safe third countries", has a responsibility to support the countries on the periphery of the EU in protecting the EU's external borders and controlling immigration.
In concrete terms, this means committing to a robust defence of the EU's external borders and supporting our partner countries particularly affected by migrant movements in guaranteeing legitimate applicants a swift procedure on the ground and appropriate distribution in order to quickly identify and reject applicants who wish to abuse asylum legislation, using coercive police measures if necessary.
20	21
We call for mandatory residence zones at EU borders and outside the EU under EU control, as set out in the negotiating position of the Council of the European Union on the Asylum Procedures Regulation at the beginning of June 2023. As deportations are de facto difficult and should be a last resort, the (preliminary) decision on admission must take place in these residence zones, naturally under humane conditions.
This must be accompanied by the principle that a decision on an asylum application is only to be made once in the EU, which must be made immediately upon reaching the first EU external border in such a residence zone. Onward travel to other EU countries with the aim of applying for asylum there must be prevented.
This is the only way to quickly help those who are truly entitled and to counteract the current practice that physical strength and the availability of financial resources de facto decide who is allowed to come and stay and who is not.
If the right to stay is refused or in the event of serious violations of the law, those affected must return to their country of origin immediately, if possible on the basis of readmission agreements with their home country or third countries. Undocumented applicants must always remain in a state reception center until their identity has been clarified; for the sake of good order, they must accept this appropriate temporary restriction on their freedom of movement.
Migrants intercepted or rescued on the high seas must be returned to their coasts of origin without exception in order to minimize incentives for life-threatening, illegal entry attempts by sea in the interest of the refugees.
In the case of sea rescue, it must always be examined to what extent it is really a matter of rescuing people from distress at sea or of aiding illegal entry into the EU disguised as "sea rescue" and thus aiding and abetting smuggling and trafficking in human beings.
Link development funds and visas to the willingness of the countries of origin to receive them
One deficit in the enforcement of a reasonable border regime throughout Europe is the slow return of asylum seekers who have been rejected under the rule of law to their home countries.
The EU must work to ensure that every country that receives development aid and/or visa facilitation also takes back its citizens if they cannot assert a legal right to enter the EU. Otherwise, the aid or facilitations must be canceled.
Fighting the global causes of flight
Germany and the EU should make every effort to help reduce or eliminate the causes of flight worldwide, for example through development cooperation, trade or economic promotion measures.
Alliance Germany is also committed to improving the environmental conditions in the main areas of origin of migrants so that people can stay in their home countries.
Immigration to the EU only on the basis of European values
The unconditional recognition of our fundamental values, such as full equality between men and women, the separation of state and religion (secularism), compulsory education and respect for different individual lifestyles, must be a basic condition for regular immigration into the European Union.
Cultural and religious customs that contradict our legal system or social order, such as the subordination of women, polygamy, veiling, forced and early marriage, circumcision of girls or women, so-called "honor killings", interference with compulsory education and Sharia rules, have no place in Europe. Anyone who demands this as an asylum seeker must return to their home country.
In addition to rights, immigrants also have duties here, above all full compliance with the law. Non-EU citizens who commit crimes must be deported immediately. Crimes committed by foreign family clans unwilling to integrate must be consistently prevented and punished throughout Europe.
22
Last but not least, it is the right of all European nations to manage immigration in such a way that a loss of European cultural identity due to immigration from other cultures can be ruled out. This is only possible if the immigration figures do not permanently exceed society's integration capacities.
Bündnis Deutschland wants the municipalities to have a greater say here. If the federal government does not reimburse the municipalities for the actual costs, it must look after asylum seekers and refugees in federal facilities.

For an industrially highly developed and densely populated continent like Europe, energy policy is of central importance. A reliable, affordable and environmentally friendly energy supply is an indispensable basis for industrial competitiveness, the safeguarding of prosperity and thus the preservation of social peace in the European Union.
The political approaches of Bündnis Deutschland are reason-based and open to technology. We reject a fear-driven energy, environmental and climate policy.
ENERGY CONCEPTS
Ensuring a base-load capable energy supply
An industrially highly developed community of states
such as the EU requires a
The different types of energy generation must be objectively evaluated and prioritized according to the criteria of security of supply, self-sufficiency, costs and environmental protection. European energy policy must be geared towards these criteria alone.
As some European countries have very different geographical and geological conditions for the use of fossil and renewable energy generation, regional diversification of the energy supply plays an important role in ensuring security of supply.
The decommissioned German nuclear power plants must be put back into operation if this is technically and legally possible. Research in nuclear-specific scientific disciplines must be supported throughout Europe and restored in Germany in particular.
Research funding must also be made available for pan-European energy research programs. Particular attention must be paid to energy generation through nuclear fusion.
When it comes to environmental protection, keeping the air, soil and water clean, protecting natural areas and the recycling approach, together with the responsible use of natural raw materials, have top priority.
All measures must always be verified according to strict criteria in terms of their effectiveness and their contribution to achieving objectives. Citizens, industry and national economies have a right to expect that the measures adopted are appropriate and target- oriented and that the funds provided are used efficiently.
permanent base-load capable energy supply. Due to the daily and seasonal fluctuations in the available solar radiation and the available wind supply, solar and wind energy only have limited base load capability. This fact must be taken into account when planning the further expansion of renewable energies.
Fossil fuels diversify and secure the energy supply and should therefore be included in the energy mix. If the necessary fossil fuels cannot be produced in Europe itself, long- term supply contracts with more than one supplier should be sought in order to ensure a reliable and base-load-capable energy supply even in times of crisis.
Expanding low-CO2 energy supply through nuclear energy
In the context of the aforementioned diversification criteria, the expansion of nuclear energy as the form of energy generation with the highest energy density and the lowest land requirements is of paramount importance. Small Modular Reactor concepts may offer the possibility of realizing the necessary expansion of nuclear energy in a shorter period of time at lower investment costs.
Projects in the planning stage must be completed in accordance with uniform European safety standards. The decommissioned power plants in Germany, for which a recommissioning is technically and legally possible, must be put back into operation.
26	27
Strengthening research and European cooperation
Research into technologies to secure the energy supply and increase resource efficiency must be promoted throughout Europe. In order to ensure a secure supply of affordable energy for the population and the economy at all times, we are committed to the joint development of sustainable generation and storage technologies at EU level. In this way, an important pan-European contribution to prosperity and competitiveness can be made.
The prerequisite for this is the prioritization of research and development of an intelligent generation infrastructure (i.e. further developments and research in the areas of energy efficiency, control of volatile forms of generation, storage options, control in transmission and distribution grids).
The EU must take up new, cross-thematic and system-oriented research approaches in a corresponding energy research program. This is the only way to tap into additional potential for the innovation process along the entire value chain.
Holistic project funding can p r o v i d e a steering instrument that enables targeted political action. We therefore call for sufficient funds to be made available for European programs for the development of energy technologies.
Promptly expand participation in nuclear fusion research in Europe
Nuclear fusion has long nurtured hopes of a future with virtually unlimited energy availability, while at the same time posing only minimal risks to people and the environment.
However, high scientific and technological hurdles still need to be overcome in order to make nuclear fusion usable in practice. To this end, ongoing, long-term projects (national (Wendelstein 7-X in Greifswald) and international (ITER in France)) should be examined to determine whether Germany's participation could be expanded or further developed.
Some start-ups are trying to realize new concepts with regard to nuclear research at high financial risk. Such projects must be supported in Germany. Every single (qualified) failure is the basis for new findings and developments.
Germany should identify a site for a commercially viable fusion reactor in the next five years and have this site ready, together with financial support for a promising project.
It must be possible to realize a building without delay, without the often decades-long approval procedures preventing the connection to international progress.
Such a location would demonstrate Germany's long-term support for fusion technology.
giving greater importance to environmental policy
Sustainably protecting basic resources such as water and air
Air and water do not stop at borders and are essential goods that are worth protecting. The EU directives on soil, air and water quality are coherent overall and should be transposed into nationally adapted legal standards - if not already in place - and updated on an ongoing basis in line with the current state of knowledge.
No one should be excluded from access to water due to ownership or pricing. Bündnis Deutschland is committed to the effective and sustainable protection of these basic resources at EU level and in Germany.
28	29
Comply with environmental standards when expanding renewable energies
Care must be taken to ensure that applicable environmental standards are observed when promoting renewable energies (e.g. in the production, operation and disposal of energy storage systems, wind turbines and solar panels). Climate policy measures must not jeopardize animal welfare and environmental protection or reduce their importance.
In particular, greater political weight must be given to the protection of forests and wildlife as well as cultural landscapes and protected areas. Wind power development must not come at the cost of the loss of valuable natural areas. The protection of people must also be taken into account by limiting construction heights and distance rules.
Handling raw materials responsibly
Raw materials are finite. Renewable raw materials are also subject to limitations. Raw materials converted into consumer goods are often not recyclable and pollute and burden the environment. For these reasons, the responsible and resource-conserving use of raw materials is essential.
Wherever there are signs of technical feasibility and economic viability, recycling processes should be used in production and disposal. Their further technological development should be promoted.
CLIMATE PROTECTION ALSO WORKS WITHOUT BANS
No to the CO2 tax
With a share of 9.5%, Europe ranks third in global anthropogenic CO2 emissions after China (31%) and the USA (13.5%). The largest CO2 producers by sector are energy production, industry and transportation. It is important for economic development
It is equally counterproductive for Europe's environment and the climate if Brussels forces companies with unrealistic environmental requirements to relocate to countries with lower environmental standards.
In order not to overburden citizens and the economy as a whole, climate protection measures must combine maximum impact with the lowest possible implementation effort and running costs.
A purely European CO2 levy should be scrapped in this context; instead, efforts should be made to ensure that agreements are reached at international level that can be enforced in practice.
Bündnis Deutschland wants to renegotiate the EU's CO2 reduction plans. They are overburdening the German economy in particular and harming Germany. This goes hand in hand with the abolition of the planned European CO2 border adjustment mechanism (CBAM).
Realistic, albeit less ambitious, targets must have clear priority over agreements that strive for an ideal situation that lacks any practical feasibility. Effective limitation of global CO2 emissions is only possible through international cooperation.
Preventing a Europe-wide ban on combustion engines
Alliance Germany is committed to technological openness. A one-sided and blanket ban on technology must not and will not happen with us, especially as the production of e-fuels makes it possible to operate combustion engines in a largely climate-neutral way.
Similarly, we reject the expensive and inefficient subsidization of technologies such as electric vehicles, for which there are still considerable hurdles to widespread use, including the lack of charging infrastructure, recycling options for battery storage or safety risks in the event of a fire.
If technologies actually bring benefits for consumers and for society as a whole, they will prevail via the market economy; the state-orchestrated implementation of politically desired technological approaches is neither necessary nor sensible.
30
Open-ended research on climate change
It must be ensured that the universities and institutes working in the field of climate and climate impact research are able to conduct their research in an open-ended manner and without political influence or expectations. Due to the enormous political and economic impact of the scientific statements made there, this is particularly crucial in climate and climate impact research.
In particular, it must be possible to critically scrutinize scientific findings without social or professional sanctions and, if necessary, adapt them to the state of science and research without ideological blinkers. Dogmatism has no place in the sciences.
Place more emphasis on adapting to the consequences of climate change
Preparations for dealing with climate change must be stepped up. Taking into account the developments to date, it is likely that global warming will continue for the time being. The 1.5-degree target set out in the Paris Agreement can in fact be ruled out.
Accordingly, political measures must be taken now to mitigate the potential negative consequences of climate change as far as possible. This can be achieved by building and maintaining dykes and renaturalizing river courses, for example.
European afforestation with mixed forests must be promoted. The afforestation of mixed forests protects areas from erosion and landslides. It also binds CO2 and releases oxygen in a way that no technical process can do today.

Bündnis Deutschland advocates that the member states should be allowed to shape their national economies and tax legislation as independently as possible.
In order to strengthen the European single market, the European Union, as a link between states, should strengthen trade and the economy and free it from bureaucracy as much as possible. We are opposed to over-regulation and the build-up of bureaucracy in the EU. The aim should be to make the European Economic Area as competitive as possible.
The euro has a central role to play as a common currency. It has been designed to ensure stability as the backbone of the European economic system. To this end, it is necessary to fully comply with the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. The subsidiarity principle of the European Union must be taken into account in all regulations, including in the areas of currency, finance, economy and social affairs.
ENSURING CURRENCY STABILITY WITHOUT IFS AND BUTS
Reforming the euro for success
Instead of introducing Eurobonds, which pave the way for a transfer union, we want a strong euro with full compliance with and enforcement of the Euro Stability Pact and the Maastricht convergence criteria.
The euro was introduced as a common currency to guarantee and promote European integration, peace and prosperity in the participating countries. It was promised to be a stable currency that would form the backbone for healthy economic growth and prosperity.
The decisions taken by the European Union in recent years, on the other hand, have destabilized the euro, particularly through the creation of large rescue packages in response to the unchecked indebtedness of individual EU member states.
We are of the opinion that government liabilities should be secured by higher equity ratios to prevent the debt spiral from spiraling out of control. It must be reviewed whether the system for determining the core capital ratio is still practicable today and whether the determination should be linked to the banks' total assets.
Government bonds are risky and must therefore be backed by an appropriate amount of equity, just like bonds issued by private issuers. The acquisition of government bonds by public bodies such as central banks or EU funds must be prevented.
Counteracting inflation
In recent years, inflation in Germany and Europe has been fueled by supply chain problems due to various corona lockdowns and the associated transport bottlenecks, by the war of aggression on Ukraine in violation of international law and by a misguided energy policy that has led to a massive increase in energy prices.
However, the main cause of the strong inflationary trends currently being observed is the massive expansion of the money supply by the European Central Bank over the last 15 years. During this period, the M3 money supply in the eurozone has more than doubled to 16 trillion euros.
The reason for this exorbitant rise was the lax interest rate policy of recent years and, above all, the purchase of government bonds by the European Central Bank in order to save highly indebted governments from national bankruptcy. The ECB has hardly or not at all fulfilled its actual task of monitoring and stabilizing the euro.
Bündnis Deutschland stands for a central bank that pursues an early and forward-looking interest rate policy and which, with capable staff and the necessary sensitivity, warns of existing risks in good time and can offer solutions.
34	35
The independence of the European Central Bank must be strengthened and its decisions must be protected from political influence.
It must be ensured that the ECB can fulfil its task of stabilizing the value of money instead of primarily providing the member states with cheap money.
Receive cash
Cash is lived data protection and individual freedom. That is why we advocate the preservation of cash as a means of payment and savings.
The current cash system works efficiently and reliably and meets the needs of citizens. Abolishing cash would create additional technological dependencies and could lead to an increased centralization of control over the monetary system, which is associated with considerable risks to privacy and individual freedom. Furthermore, there are considerable concerns regarding data protection and data security. This also applies to the current development of the EU asset register, which we clearly reject as an intrusive political measure.
In the discussion on the introduction of a cash ceiling in the European Union, Bündnis Deutschland has come to the conclusion, after weighing up liberal values and the extended possibilities for combating money laundering and illegal employment in Germany in particular, that it agrees to a cash ceiling of at least 15,000 euros in the eurozone. We are firmly opposed to a lower cash ceiling, as is currently being discussed.
No to the e-euro
We are generally in favor of the development of more modern payment methods and currencies. We reject the actual introduction of the e-euro, as the cost of introducing and monitoring the e-euro is disproportionate to the few advantages. We stand for a liberal financial policy, also with regard to the financial resources themselves. However, it must always be possible for companies to accept decentralized cryptocurrencies exclusively on a self-determined and voluntary basis. We reject compulsory payment.
However, cryptocurrencies are not suitable as legal tender due to their high volatility and lack of government control.
Evaluate and adapt TARGET2 system
The balances of the TARGET2 system (now T2) mean that the central banks of the states have receivables and liabilities with each other. Germany's TARGET2 receivables amount to over 1 trillion euros (as at July 2023). Meanwhile, Italy has accumulated liabilities of over 550 billion euros (as at July 2023).
In order to encourage the states of the European Union to accompany these liabilities and not to build them up further, an improvement in liquidity management must be created. The European Central Bank, which should monitor the TARGET2 system, must intervene more restrictively.
We also demand that the TARGET2 balances bear interest at a uniform rate so that outstanding amounts are treated as a loan. Furthermore, outstanding TARGET liabilities must be repaid by the respective nation state if they exceed the proportionality of its own assets. First-class collateralized government securities or gold may also be suitable for repayment.
In addition, the liabilities of a state must be capped on the basis of the respective financial situation, so that a liability amount that a state can in fact no longer repay is not accumulated in the first place.
Revise the ECB's representation system
We are committed to replacing the rotation principle in the Governing Council of the European Central Bank with a system that measures the effective voting weight of the eurozone countries primarily on the basis of their contributions to the European Union budget.
In our view, a new regulation is absolutely necessary here, as it is not acceptable that significantly smaller countries with significantly smaller budget contributions receive exactly the same voting rights as the largest EU contributor, Germany.
36	37
It is also important to prevent Europe's largest economy from completely losing its voting rights in ECB Governing Council meetings at certain times due to the rotation principle.
YES TO SOUND FINANCES, NO TO EUROPEAN DEBT
No joint borrowing, for a return to financial discipline
Bündnis Deutschland rejects any further communitization of debt by direct or indirect means. Instead of inventing further mechanisms that are directed against the contractual agreements at European level and thus break existing law, we demand that the criteria from the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact be adhered to again in future without restrictions.
If a country violates these criteria over a longer period of time, for example five years, it should be possible for this country to be excluded from the monetary union. Following the model of a breathing monetary union, as once formulated by Wolfgang Schäuble, a country can leave the euro and re-enter at a later date if it demonstrably meets the necessary criteria again and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
Such an exclusion should enable a country to achieve the necessary criteria again, for example by devaluing its own currency. In such a case, the European Union should have plans in place to make an exclusion as easy as possible and at the same time prevent a fiscal imbalance from spreading to other eurozone countries.
No to the EU Finance Minister
Bündnis Deutschland consistently rejects the often-discussed introduction of a European Union finance minister. Budgetary law is a sovereign right of the national parliaments. Transferring this sovereign right to the EU would lead to a loss of national control over their own financial policy and would massively restrict their freedom to shape their own budgetary and tax policy.
We believe that the European Union is based on the principle of subsidiarity and solidarity between free and independent member states. The introduction of a European finance minister and an independent European budgetary policy would undermine this solidarity, which would lead to division between the member states.
Strengthening confidence in the eurozone countries
In order to strengthen confidence in the eurozone countries and to make the most important key figures transparent for all EU citizens, we propose that in future all member states of the monetary union should prepare their national budgets in accordance with the standards of double-entry bookkeeping.
These balance sheets are to be reviewed and certified by an independent body at European level.
PUSHING FOR A RETURN TO A MARKET ECONOMY
Scaling back rescue packages in favor of the market economy
The EU must promote a return to market economy principles. Emergency aid and bailouts were temporarily necessary, but have now been abandoned in favor of competition and a return to market economy principles.
38	39
The innovative strength of companies and founders must be reduced, also in the interests of sound finances.
There must be no development in which the European Community moves from one rescue package to the next. The aim must be to return to an economic cycle that is as subsidy-free as possible. The positive experiences that Germany has historically had with its social market economy should also benefit its European partner countries.
Expanding European trade routes
In terms of European trade routes, the north-south axis on Germany's eastern border must be expanded. This is the basis for a further economic upturn in south-eastern Europe (including Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia), for example in the tourism sector, which will also benefit Germany. The consequences of the division of Europe into Eastern and Western blocs must be eliminated by 1990.
The transport route system of the "German hub" must be supported by the EU with more funds - this applies in particular to the railways. Germany is overstretched here in terms of maintenance and expansion. More freight traffic must be shifted to rail - with positive effects on the climate too.
Ensuring the competitiveness of European companies
Prosperous companies are the prerequisite for high wages for employees and for the financing of state transfer payments. EU policy must create location factors so that European companies are internationally competitive, particularly with regard to administrative costs and access to capital.
Lending to companies must be based on economic criteria. Linking loans to ethical and ecological standards puts companies with traditional business models at an existential disadvantage in international competition. We stand for the abolition of such planned- economy regulations.
Legal requirements that overburden (small and medium-sized) companies should be abolished. Typical examples are the European Supply Chain Act, the CSR directives and CBAM. Bündnis Deutschland also o p p o s e s the planned ban on so-called "perpetuity chemicals PFAS", whose harmfulness is based on assumptions.
Reduce regulation in the financial sector to what is necessary
Following the financial crisis, there has been a significant expansion of regulation in the financial sector in Europe. Bündnis Deutschland believes that regulation is necessary and that the "free play of forces" must be subject to clear rules, especially in the financial sector. A crisis like that must not be allowed to happen again and private investors must know what they are getting into with which investments.
In contrast to other economic areas, however, Europe has once again clearly overstepped the mark and created significant overregulation. This over-regulation has developed into a significant competitive disadvantage for European banks. While banks in America are once again earning record sums, European banks are introducing one structural reform after another to ensure their profitability. In addition, private investors are being patronized, securities have to be checked for their target group and not everyone is allowed to buy every security.
This goes against the principle of personal responsibility, which is a valuable asset for Bündnis Deutschland. The high level of complexity in investment advice (see sustainability) increases the workload of banks, while on the other hand they are to be prohibited from disclosing income, so-called kickbacks, to customers.
In addition, any regulation that we introduce in Europe (financial transaction tax, ban on short selling), like other economic policy measures, will not improve the situation, but only shift the corresponding business to non-regulated foreign countries. The financial transaction tax in particular is a new juggernaut which, on the one hand, will cause considerable expense for the banks when it comes to levying it and, on the other hand, will not actually flush the hoped-for money into the state's coffers.

Once again, it is private investors who are actually affected, while the large companies (hedge funds), which are to be reprimanded as a result, are relocating their business to non-European countries. Bündnis Deutsch- land is in favor of slowing down computer trading - but this only makes sense if all non-European countries follow suit. Otherwise, this well-intentioned rule will put Europe's stock exchanges at a competitive disadvantage.
Bündnis Deutschland is therefore in favor of a review of the existing regulations in the financial sector and is calling for a clear assessment of the benefits and costs before additional rules are introduced.
Reforming the EU right of withdrawal in the interests of small companies
If a tradesman concludes an order outside his business premises, he must inform his customer of the right of withdrawal. Otherwise, the customer can cancel the order without having to pay for costs already incurred - even if the work has already been completed. The European Court of Justice has reaffirmed this in a ruling.
The right of withdrawal opened up by the EU directive places completely excessive bureaucratic demands on tradespeople and service providers. The right of withdrawal has been designed by the EU in such a way that there is a risk of withdrawal by the customer for almost every contract, even though the customer has received the service and thereby achieved an actual and financial advantage.
We call for a reform of the right of withdrawal (Consumer Rights Directive). We a d v o c a t e a return to consumer responsibility and greater legal certainty for tradespeople and service providers.
The principle that contracts must be adhered to has been undermined by completely excessive consumer protection. According to the EU directive, the withdrawal policy must be in writing.
We demand a reduction in bureaucracy and the reliability of contractual agreements. Empowered citizens and contract compliance are the cornerstones of a medium-sized economy.
SOCIAL SECURITY MUST REMAIN A MATTER FOR THE MEMBER STATES
No to EU unemployment insurance and EU pension insurance
Bündnis Deutschland rejects an EU unemployment insurance scheme and an EU pension insurance scheme, as a standardized Europe-wide social insurance scheme would lump together structurally very different labour markets and hitherto very different systems for financing old-age pensions to the detriment of all those involved.
With regard to unemployment insurance, it can be assumed that countries with low unemployment figures will be disproportionately called upon to finance weaker labor markets in other member states. Seasonal unemployment in the tourism sector in the Mediterranean countries, for example, would also have to be partially borne by the other member states.
In addition, the close integration of various social insurance schemes, such as unemployment insurance and pension insurance, argues against Europe-wide standardization. The social systems must be seen as a whole and cannot be regulated "slice by slice".
While an employee in Germany continues to pay into unemployment insurance until the age of 67, employees in other EU countries have long since retired at this age. This inevitably results in unequal treatment when it comes to the generation of the underlying financial resources.
43
The quality and effectiveness of existing European education programs must be continuously reviewed. European education initiatives are essential, not least in view of the ever-increasing shortage of skilled workers.
The English language should be taught in all schools throughout Europe at an early stage. However, in view of the shortage of skilled workers, Germany should also promote the learning of German in other European countries. Vocational training systems must be standardized. Efforts should be made to develop the German dual training system into a Europe-wide standard. In this context, the proportion of young people who complete training in other European countries must be increased.
The European Union can fully exploit its power when science and research network across Europe and take up projects that exceed the financial possibilities of the individual nation states. Partnerships between scientific institutions and the exchange of students as well as the granting of scholarships for STEM disciplines should be promoted.
EU research funding should be made less bureaucratic in order to speed up the application process, and the start-up culture should be promoted throughout Europe.
Research into future technologies must be coordinated, bundled and supported financially and in terms of personnel throughout Europe. This includes, in particular, aerospace technology, artificial intelligence, energy supply technology, especially nuclear fusion technology and the development of a European navigation system.

A HOLISTIC VIEW OF EDUCATION
Intensifying European educational cooperation at a high level
44	45
Promoting vocational education and training in Europe more intensively and holistically
Important initiatives have already been taken in the EU to support vocational education and training, and important principles and objectives have been formulated for the future of vocational education and training. However, in order to make a contribution to the promotion of qualified specialists to support the labor markets in Europe, it must not remain with principles and principles and rather nebulous program initiatives.
EU funding programs such as the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and Erasmus+ have been and continue to be important pillars for education and training, the comprehensive promotion of skills and lifelong learning in Europe.
The funding and resources provided by the EU through Erasmus+ for individuals, organizations and educational policy reforms are already very high, whether for studies, training or the personal development of students, trainees and teachers abroad. This is generally to be welcomed. It is recommended that continuous evaluations be carried out to ensure that funds are allocated appropriately and that the desired quality is actually achieved.
Supporting educational cooperation in Europe in binational and collaborative formats with a focus on learning outcomes
To enable trainees and skilled workers to successfully navigate the European region and the labor markets relevant to them, it is important to develop and expand professional skills as well as technical, linguistic and intercultural competencies. To this end, we want to increase the proportion of young people who spend time abroad during their training.
Key elements for successful educational cooperation in the field of vocational education and training are the focus on learning outcomes (as an instrument for profiling and quality assurance for work-related exchange placements) and orientation towards the ECVET process (ECVET = European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training), which enables certification of the skills acquired (e.g. inclusion in Europass). Taking into account the use of these basic principles, it is important to further develop the proven credit and competence recording system so that new competences can also be acquired,
z. e.g. digital and data skills, can be considered in an integrated manner.
We need to arrive at an agile roadmap that successfully implements good concepts in the EU countries in a timely manner and at the same time takes new challenges - such as the serious changes in the world of work brought about by AI - into account.
In the area of vocational training, we are committed to supporting EU countries in implementing the dual system of vocational training, which has been very successful in Germany, if this is desired there. In this way, we would like to contribute to the standardization of vocational training systems in Europe, which has immense advantages for the mobility of skilled workers, among other things.
Target-oriented evaluation of the electronic EU adult education platform EPALE
The EPALE education platform set up for adult education in Europe has been consuming considerable financial resources for years, but it is not being used sufficiently. It must therefore be put to the test and comprehensively evaluated. A decision must then be made as to how the hoped-for goals can be achieved efficiently.
46	47
PROMOTING SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGE AND SCIENTIFIC TALENT
Intensifying the exchange of scientists in Europe
Germany can only succeed in international competition through joint research and development in Europe. Only in this way can Germany contribute to raising the overall position of the EU member states to a high level in terms of science. This applies in particular to projects that exceed the capabilities of a single country.
To this end, the exchange of scientists between research institutions, universities and companies must be facilitated and bureaucratic hurdles must finally be significantly reduced. Digital exchange between scientists and the temporary exchange of personnel are important. We attach great importance to ensuring that intellectual property rights are protected and copyrights remain untouched in such a European network for science and research.
Securing the transfer of scientific knowledge within the EU
The transfer of new scientific findings to the economy and society must be intensively promoted in Europe in general and in Germany in particular. To this end, regional and thematic cluster structures can be expanded and economic clout increased through stronger European networking.
New instruments must be developed and implemented in Europe in order to realize a better transfer of scientific findings at universities and research institutions into usable services and products.
We also call for the introduction of a high-quality European open access platform for scientific publications. This enables unrestricted access to scientific results and represents an important contribution to comprehensive transfer assurance.
Strengthening and expanding cooperation between universities and scientists in Europe
Bündnis Deutschland would like to achieve a new quality of scientific cooperation in Europe. To this end, German science and research organizations must work together to ensure that their activities are more closely networked with suitable players from the EU.
The mobility of German students and academics must be specifically promoted. The basis for this is the further development of the recognition system for academic achievements in Europe so that more students can gain study-related experience abroad. This can be done with the involvement of the German Academic Exchange Service and suitable foundations that promote Germany as a location for education and science as part of international university marketing.
Promoting scientific talent and practical partnerships in the STEM field
Alliance Germany aims to make Europe the leading continent in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This objective is not only important for prosperity, but also for overcoming future challenges.
The proposal is to establish a European scholarship program for STEM students that rewards talent and commitment. The aim of this initiative is to create a generation of highly qualified specialists who can use their passion for science and technology for the benefit of society. In doing so, Germany could contribute the Highly Talented Students Support Program for Vocational Education and Training.
In addition, the promotion of partnerships between universities and technology companies must be intensified. These partnerships should ensure practical training and facilitate the transition from training to employment.
48	49
With these measures, Alliance Germany is pursuing the goal of bringing Europe to the forefront of technological innovation and strengthening the economy for the age of digitalization and AI.
Upgrading the German diploma
Bündnis Deutschland is committed to ensuring that, in addition to Bachelor's and Master's degrees, the tried and tested German diploma, which is valued worldwide, is permanently recognized and is also accepted as an academic qualification in other European countries.
MAKING EUROPE THE INTERNATIONAL INNOVATION SPEARHEAD
Intensify research for innovation
The next European framework program for research and innovation "Horizon Europe" must be provided with sufficient funding for the coming funding period 2025-2027. This is the only way to develop innovations in Europe through to commercial use.
Bündnis Deutschland expressly welcomes the involvement of German institutions and companies in this area so as not to lose touch and to generate new opportunities for the economy and society.
In order to be successful internationally again, we need to promote innovation. We can achieve this by initiating competitions for clusters of excellence or getting involved in European networks. This will enable us to regain a successful international presence in all lead markets.
Expanding research funding for SMEs in Europe
Small and medium-sized enterprises should be given greater, unbureaucratic access to funding for research and development. To this end, it is important to open up cooperation with universities and research institutions in Europe in a targeted manner. This will support technology-oriented innovation in Germany and at the same time intensify cooperation between companies in Europe.
Optimizing the organization of EU research funding
The economy and society are increasingly facing immense challenges that require the rapid implementation of innovative measures and initiatives based on sound research. In order to speed up the approval process for important research projects, we are committed to reducing bureaucracy in the application process for research funding. It must be ensured that research funding can be approved within around six months.
The administrative hurdles for European projects in particular are extremely high and almost impossible for applicants to overcome. Scientists are specialized experts with good ideas and concepts on which they should concentrate. Increased support from the approval and coordination bodies, such as the project management agencies, is therefore necessary for the time-consuming administrative tasks of project applications and financial management.
Ensuring a level playing field for basic research in the EU
Successful basic research often requires international cooperation, for example through the establishment of larger research networks. German research institutions are often unable to keep up with EU standards, for example due to high energy costs, bureaucratic requirements or ideologically motivated restrictions.
The aim here is to create a level playing field in Europe and to ensure that this is appropriate in international comparison and does not decouple Europe from international developments.
50	51
The following examples illustrate where to start: many large-scale research projects and
-Experiments such as those in high-energy physics or in materials or process research with synchrotron radiation sources as well as high-vacuum and X-ray devices require a large amount of electrical energy as they have to be operated continuously.
The affected research centers in Germany must therefore be supported in such a way that research remains possible without restrictions despite the high energy costs. Otherwise, the relevant research areas in Germany will be irretrievably lost.
Understanding the strategic role of aerospace research for Germany and Europe
Aerospace research plays an important strategic role for Germany as a business location. Self-determined, independent access to space is becoming increasingly important.
Aerospace research is also a cornerstone of European cooperation and a pioneer in the development and testing of new technologies. Technology transfer acts as a driver of innovation in other sectors of the economy. Germany should consistently develop its national funding structures and participate in new space research programs for Europe.
The mass transportation of smaller satellites, e.g. for navigation or communication purposes, has become increasingly important. Reusable systems can be used successfully and cost-effectively for this purpose. In order to become competitive within the EU, it is necessary to develop missile systems that can return to water and land multiple times.
Start-ups for the development of carrier systems with a lower load-bearing capacity should be supported. This would be an important, motivating impulse for training, research and technology in this future area. Suitable launch sites must be made available in Europe, including in Germany. Mobile platforms in the North Sea should be pursued.
The realization of the European Ariane 6 launcher is continually being delayed and is becoming more and more expensive. Due to the decision to discontinue the use of Ariane 5, the EU now lacks the corresponding transportation options into space. Dependence on transportation options provided by non-EU countries is not acceptable at any time.
Establishing an ambitious start-up culture in European research
Alliance Germany emphasizes the importance of big ambitions and risk-taking for a thriving startup culture that fully exploits its innovation potential. It is important that the EU supports a change in mentality throughout society that encourages budding entrepreneurs to pursue big ambitions. This is the only way to unleash entrepreneurial potential and fully promote innovation.
By supporting projects that promote startup culture and an open attitude in society, the EU can strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Europe and contribute to economic growth, job creation and a culture of progress and innovation. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
PROMOTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, TAKING RISKS SERIOUSLY
Develop a high-tech and innovation strategy for the EU and implement it promptly with "roadmap ping"
The successful use of innovative technologies requires a holistic high-tech and innovation strategy for Europe. It is important to integrate existing EU strategy developments in the digitalization and data environment in a timely manner. Only in this way can a holistic roadmapping be realized, taking into account the diverse megatrends and disruptive technological developments.
52	53
In cooperation with European partner countries, Germany must shape these future tasks in collaboration with science, society, business and politics. Above all, it is important to use trend and technology radars to focus on technological and social innovations and then initiate and implement application projects in a timely manner.
The aim must be to maintain our own technology platforms and production lines in the European alliance for key technologies and core competencies in the areas of energy supply, information and communication technology, digitalization, data and analytics as well as artificial intelligence (including machine learning), cyber security and quantum computing.
Establish technology clusters in Europe for technologies of global importance
We call for the formation of technology clusters in Europe that explicitly claim global significance and strengthen Europe in international comparison. Technology areas that open up a future-oriented application in nation states should be mentioned:
Seawater desalination, optimized production of green hydrogen and e-fuels, CO2 storage, use of geothermal energy, high-temperature superconductors for loss-free electricity transport, 3D printing of houses including thermal insulation and protection against natural disasters. Other examples include the development of new, environmentally friendly thermal insulation materials, e.g. based on aerogels, as well as intelligent window systems for heat regulation with integrated power generation.
Using intelligent technologies such as AI and machine learning (ML) as an opportunity
Artificial intelligence (AI) and other intelligent technologies - such as hyperautomation, robotic process automation and machine learning (ML) - are currently experiencing an immense surge in applications in almost all areas of life. AI and ML will bring about significant innovations in the coming years: examples include self-driving vehicles, chatbots in e-commerce and technologies in medical research.
The EU must face up to the opportunities and risks of these innovative developments by undertaking joint application-related efforts by science and research institutions to ensure that these innovative technologies are successfully anchored in the economy and society.
AI is being used to drive and accelerate innovation in various industries and areas. By using AI technologies, companies and organizations can improve their processes, develop new products and services and gain a competitive advantage. It is therefore imperative that we in Europe see developments in intelligent technologies that enable machines to perceive, understand, act and learn as an opportunity.
No frivolous bans or restrictions should be imposed here, such as the planned AI Act, which the EU Parliament has already initiated - this would quickly set Germany and Europe far behind in international comparison. Overregulation by the EU Parliament must be prevented so that the AI Act does not become a software act that would then regulate almost all software.
In view of the investments made by international competitors, including China and the USA, in the development of AI, international competitiveness must be maintained in order not to lose the market leadership that still exists in individual areas in the near future.
On the other hand, the emerging fields of application must also be accompanied and safeguarded by the EU in terms of ethics and data protection. Data protection is important, but must not hinder dynamic development in this area from the outset. Personal applications of AI for e.g. recruitment procedures, university admissions or applications for certificates must be subject to expert review. It must be ensured that a human decision-maker verifies and takes responsibility for such results.
Overall, the EU should therefore place particular emphasis on the development and promotion of data skills (so-called data literacy) among all age groups.
By establishing ethical guidelines and testing systems, artificial intelligence is to be further researched and promoted in order to serve the well-being of people.
54	55
However, the EU must refrain from establishing additional authorities and centers to promote and control innovation. A lean and open market gives innovation enough incentive to establish itself on the European market.
Evaluate application potential for quantum computing in a timely manner and promote its widespread use in the EU
Quantum computers make it possible to solve complicated problems incomparably faster than the fastest supercomputers. Applications can be found, for example, in cryptology, materials research and quantum chemistry, which is important for pharmaceutical research. Falling behind in this area would have fatal consequences for Europe's science and economy.
We expect university education in the field of quantum computing to be promoted in Germany and Europe. This is the only way to enable researchers to develop new chemicals and materials, for example for fuel cells, batteries and catalysts.
Driving forward European projects on navigation systems
The expansion of the European Galileo navigation system must be driven forward. Positioning and time determination with very high accuracy is the basis for high technology, e.g. for autonomous driving systems. This must be absolutely reliable and independent of other systems such as GPS, Glonass and Beidou, and must be available autonomously and fail-safe under European sovereignty. Europe must not be dependent on the satellite systems of other nations.
Reliable communication and a fail-safe Internet worldwide are fundamental to the survival of free, democratic states. The consequences of the failure of international fiber optic connections between the continents would no longer be controllable. Satellite-based systems must be available to at least partially compensate for a failure and make Europe less vulnerable. The technology for this must be developed and made available.
Promoting technology and innovation transfer
Bündnis Deutschland emphasizes the importance of technology transfer from universities and research centers to the economy for social progress and innovation. We see start-ups and innovation centers as key players for economic growth and job creation.
It is therefore essential to support researchers in founding technology companies in order to transform research results into useful products.
The EU should provide financial incentives, resources and advice to make it easier to start a business. Bureaucratic hurdles must be clearly reduced. Additional measures include the promotion of mentoring programs for collaboration between start-ups and established companies as well as investment in technology parks and innovation hubs as places for collaboration and innovation. Alliance Germany is determined to promote a strong technology ecosystem in order to establish Europe as a global leader in the technology industry.
57
Bündnis Deutschland is committed to strengthening rural areas. Europe's rural regions in particular are cultural pillars that deserve more appreciation and political attention for their contribution to our society.
In agriculture, care must be taken to ensure that legal standards - especially in the area of animal husbandry - apply throughout Europe so that they do not become a burden for our farmers. Products from non-EU countries must be priced accordingly in order to compensate for the competitive disadvantages of domestic products due to stricter requirements. Overall, care must be taken to ensure that EU requirements do not become an insurmountable hurdle, especially for small-scale agriculture. We reject a general obligation to set aside land or the extension of industry standards for emissions to the agricultural sector.
More must be done in the area of animal welfare and there must be greater commitment. Standards must rise in livestock farming, in animal testing and in the keeping of pets. It is important that animal welfare regulations are agreed at European level so that they remain economically viable.

No to set-aside regulations for agriculture
Currently, one in ten people in the world suffers from hunger. The situation is particularly precarious in African countries.
Strengthening rural areas
Rural areas in particular are often neglected as a source of culture. Existing EU funding should be increasingly invested in agricultural areas with a low density of local public transport, healthcare and public maintenance services.
In peripheral locations, voluntary work and associations often play a key role. Without volunteer fire departments, many communities would be defenceless in the face of fire and natural disasters. Associations and voluntary work are also extremely important for local cohesion. The allocation of funding must also be based on this.
REVISING EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL STANDARDS
EU agricultural subsidies awarded according to differentiated criteria
The practice of European subsidy policy indiscriminately favors farms with large areas of land. We call for subsidies to be awarded in future according to more differentiated criteria that also take into account the aspects of regionality, security of supply, regional identity and the positive environmental contributions of agriculture, without agricultural policy being understood unilaterally as part of environmental policy.
At the same time, German farmers are to take 4% of their arable land out of production each year in future. According to the European "farm to fork" strategy, this set-aside area is to be increased to 10% in the coming years.
We reject the current version of the "EU Farm to Fork Strategy" as it jeopardizes the long-term supply of local food, will make a future-proof orientation of agriculture impossible and patronizes citizens in their nutritional behaviour.
These measures will further reduce the European Union's level of food self-sufficiency and increase dependence on further grain imports. The grain that we buy on the world market is therefore not available to the poorer countries of the global South and significantly exacerbates the hunger problem in these countries.
We as Alliance Germany have great confidence in our highly trained farmers. These farmers have always made a major contribution to environmental protection and, in particular, to biodiversity in our country. We therefore reject EU regulations that effectively force farmers to stop their work.
No further tightening of EU industrial emissions directives in agriculture
As a result of the tightening of the EU Industrial Emissions Directives, in the future, pig and poultry farms and, for the first time, cattle farms with more than 150 livestock units will also fall under the regulations of the directive.
Such an extension of directives, which are basically designed for industrial companies, leads to a high level of additional bureaucratic and financial expenditure for farmers.
60	61
Now that many farmers have recently converted their barns to improve animal welfare, farmers are once again incurring costs. Especially in a situation in which the costs for farms are rising sharply anyway (feed, energy, diesel, etc.), such decisions are an enormous burden.
Despite the justified interest in reducing emissions, the agricultural sector must not be pushed to the brink by political requirements; the capacity for further requirements has already been exceeded.
Alliance Germany calls for the inclusion of further agricultural businesses in the Industrial Emissions Directive to be stopped.
MORE ANIMAL WELFARE, MORE COMMITMENT
Enforce and monitor harmonized animal welfare standards at European level
Our animal welfare policy is based on a holistic vision that combines animal welfare, biodiversity conservation and raising awareness of animal welfare issues in society. We firmly believe that Europe can and should be at the forefront of animal welfare and are committed to achieving this goal.
An important area for this is the promotion of ethical practices in European agriculture and livestock farming. We are committed to ensuring that animals throughout Europe are kept under appropriate conditions and are protected from mistreatment. The long-term goal must be to phase out factory farming.
However, it is important to ensure that higher animal welfare standards do not force livestock farmers to choose between animal welfare and their own livelihood. Animal welfare cannot be enforced against agriculture, but only in harmony with it. We therefore advocate that high animal welfare standards apply uniformly throughout Europe.
In addition, all imported products must be priced in such a way that less stringent rules in other economic areas do not result in any competitive disadvantage for our domestic agriculture.
We also advocate the increased use of alternatives to animal testing in research, for example through simulations.
Another focus of our European animal welfare policy is the protection of endangered animal species and their habitats in Europe. The preservation of natural diversity on our continent is of great importance to us.
Educating and raising awareness of animal welfare issues among the European public is also important to us. We promote the responsible treatment of animals throughout Europe and support educational projects to raise awareness of this issue.
We are also committed to responsible pet ownership and the fight against cruelty to animals and illegal animal trade at European level. Bündnis Deutschland is therefore calling for the mandatory acquisition of certificates of competence for the keeping of exotic pets in order to ensure species-appropriate husbandry and the professional handling of these animals.
Furthermore, dangerous and endangered animals that are successfully bred in private ownership must have appropriate qualifications. These should be demanded and promoted with funds from the European Union, as pets are not just companions, but beloved family members who deserve our full attention and care.
62
MORE TRANSPARENCY CONSUMERS, MORE PROTECTION AGAINST FOOD FRAUD
Putting the responsible citizen at the center of consumer protection
Our consumer protection policy focuses on the responsible, informed citizen, who is free to choose the best offers for material and health consumer protection in a self-determined and ideology-free manner without European or state paternalism. The legal standardization of consumer protection rights must be strengthened in this direction.
Consumer protection rights in the online trade of goods, services and foodstuffs must be strengthened through extended legal and efficient IT-based regulations. To this end, the supervisory authorities must also be adequately staffed and technically equipped.
The increasing international food fraud caused by mislabeling, health-threatening substitute products as raw materials and illegal transport routes must be countered by decisive action on the part of customs and police authorities.
The labeling of food should ensure the supra-regional origin of the food, the distinctiveness of conventional, vegetarian and vegan foods and the labeling of artificially produced foods as a basis for consumers' decisions. The names of animal-based foods must not be falsified by inadmissible, ideology-based word formations, e.g. vegan sausage, oat drink, vegan fish fillet, etc.

Alliance Germany is committed to a European foreign policy that takes account of German interests, based on the Basic Law, the UN Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights, embedded in the European security architecture. Our liberal way of life in Europe, our prosperity and our security are best guaranteed if our neighbors and partners are also doing well.
We rely on good relations with our neighbors and partners and the expansion of our common foreign, security and defense policy, within the framework of the EU, the Council of Europe, NATO, OSCE and beyond.
Alliance Germany believes that the principle of unanimity in existing sensitive areas (e.g. CFSP (Common Foreign and Security Policy), CSDP (Common Security and Defense Policy), taxes, admission of new member states) within the EU must remain in place. Any relaxation of the principle of unanimity would weaken the acceptance of the EU as a whole in the case of outvoted states and increase the power of the EU vis-à-vis the nation states too much.
The European states must increasingly be able to guarantee their national defense independently, even if the USA remains our most important ally. We want to become more European and remain transatlantic at the same time.
The EU should focus its development policy in particular on poverty reduction (including water, health, education), the advancement of women and environmental and climate protection.
THE EU AS A RELIABLE AND VALUE-ORIENTED PARTNER
Securing stability and peace - maintaining existing institutions and agreements
Alliance Germany advocates the preservation of existing international institutions and agreements at national and EU level that promote peaceful coexistence and the resolution of conflicts within and outside Europe (e.g. UN, Council of Europe, OSCE, arms control and CSBM agreements).
The EU must become capable of global politics and a reliable global player
The EU must sharpen its profile as a reliable, respected global player, as a resolute defender of fundamental democratic values in the global competition between systems, also with a view to current challenges such as sustainable security, environmental protection and climate change.
China, Russia, India, South Africa and Brazil (BRICS), Middle East countries and others are pushing forcefully onto the world stage. Only together do we have a chance of defending our values and our prosperity in global competition in the long term. The interests of around 450 million EU citizens must not be crushed between non-European power blocs. A neutral stance or an "ostrich policy" are not an option for us. Europe must therefore focus on its own strengths and build on them.
The EU's close relationship with the US remains of fundamental importance for the prosperity and security of both sides and must be maintained.
66	67
Lasting peaceful solutions for Europe
The EU's relationship with Russia must be characterized by vigilant realism and prudent openness. Since the attack on Ukraine in early 2022 at the latest, it has been clear that we have to organize our security without Russia for the time being.
The restoration of cooperative relations with Russia within the framework of a common security order in Europe presupposes Russia's return to the principles of the UN Charter, including respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, and to the peaceful settlement of disputes. Russia has a responsibility - not least as a veto power on the UN Security Council - to put an end to its aggression and invasion without further ado.
Bündnis Deutschland's primary concern in the Ukraine conflict - as in general - is always the people directly affected. We therefore welcome the extensive humanitarian aid provided by Germany and the European Union (EU) for the Ukrainian population and the temporary admission of war refugees.
Based on Article 51 of the UN Charter, Ukraine has the right to defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. Based on the same provision, other countries have the right to provide it with appropriate support. Arms deliveries to Ukraine and other aid of a political, humanitarian, military and financial nature must be quantitatively and qualitatively designed in such a way that Ukraine can effectively defend itself against attacks.
Germany and the EU must work together with the US, the UK and other key players, such as NATO member Turkey, to achieve a balance of power and thus facilitate a ceasefire and negotiations on an equal footing to find a lasting peaceful solution.
Gradually becoming less dependent on China
Europe's relationship with China must take into account its new self-image as a world power with global leadership aspirations. China is becoming ever more aggressive externally and ever more repressive internally: repression by the party apparatus, threats against Taiwan, expansion in the South China Sea, restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of movement.
rights in Hong Kong and the systematic human rights violations against the Uyghurs represent serious obstacles to rapprochement.
Economically, the EU, like Germany, must gradually become less dependent on China; in particular, we must protect our critical infrastructure and intellectual property from Beijing's well-known encroaching ambitions.
Strengthen and expand EU relations with countries such as Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Brazil
We want to further strengthen and expand EU relations with other important countries such as Japan, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Brazil in our mutual interest.
Expanding rules-based free trade through further agreements
In trade policy, the EU must once again actively promote rules-based free trade, including the conclusion of further free trade agreements (most recently: with Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South America/Mercosur, etc.). However, European and German standards must be observed and must not be undermined.
To this end, the EU must counter protectionist tendencies and take a leading role in fair trade and investment agreements, while always safeguarding German and European security and property interests (sensitive infrastructure, brands, patents, etc.).
WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE EUROPEAN DEFENSE
Ensure European national defense increasingly independently, even if the USA is to remain our most important ally
68	69
Yes to NATO's northern enlargement
NATO's northern enlargement to include Finland and Sweden, which we welcome, will further strengthen the alliance. In addition to acceptable challenges, this step offers opportunities for Europe and NATO. Escalations in the global context must be prevented. Peacekeeping must be at the forefront.
Maintaining the common EU security and defense policy
The EU must increasingly take on the protection of its territory as its own task, even if the USA is to remain our most important ally. It is true that the overwhelming majority of EU member states are also NATO member states. Nevertheless, it is in the EU's interest that the EU member states can, in principle, defend EU territory without US support, which is currently not the case.
Germany in particular must do greater justice to its security responsibility for Europe as a leading nation, as is expected of us by our European and transatlantic partners, who for their part have been contributing to our protection for decades. Developments over the last 30 years have shown that there is no such thing as a "peace dividend" to be distributed in the form of social benefits.
Push European interoperability more strongly
Security risks of various kinds, the dynamics of global conflicts and geographical factors demand effective responses such as uniform, interchangeable weapons systems within the Alliance and, in general, a stronger push for European interoperability.
In this context, we also welcome the initiative launched by Germany to coordinate air defense across Europe (European Sky Shield Initiative, ESSI for short), which around twenty countries have joined so far, including neutral countries such as Austria (EU member) and Switzerland (non-EU member). European states are thus creating synergies step by step, both within and outside the EU and NATO, in order to be able to deal with threats in a coordinated manner in the interests of European interoperability.
The intergovernmental EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP) as an integral part of the Common Security and Foreign Policy (CFSP) must remain an important pillar of our EU agenda.
The EU Defense Initiative for Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO - Permanent Structured Cooperation), which has been coordinating dozens of defence policy projects since 2017, should be further expanded.
Yes to European cooperation, no to a European army
We are critical of the idea of establishing a "European army". The costs would be enormous, the organization complex and the benefits, alongside NATO, minimal.
The concept of the "EU battle groups" as temporary multi-national formations of the EU crisis response forces, for example for UN missions, has proven its worth, as have the Eurocorps as a multi-national headquarters and the Franco-German brigade.
As the armed forces of the member states suffer from a maximum of inefficient and at the same time particularly expensive fragmentation, we want to further promote the expansion of such EU battle groups within the framework of European defense cooperation.
European inspiration for the resumption of basic military service
Only a well-positioned and trained reserve can guarantee the army's credible ability to grow in the event of tension and defense. Many European partners can present sensible models of basic military service geared towards national defense for reserve formation. Germany should adapt tried and tested concepts in line with requirements.

DEVELOPMENT POSSIBLE
Using EU development policy for sustainable development
EU development policy (Art. 21 I TEU) must focus on poverty reduction, the expansion of basic infrastructure (water, education and health), the advancement of women, sustainable economic development as well as environmental and climate protection. In accordance with the proven principle of "helping people to help themselves", all people worldwide should be helped to live in dignity by linking sustainable poverty reduction projects with economic, ecological and social development.
Such projects must be implemented by professional organizations, such as the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit or KfW, with transparent accounting. Budget support, i.e. direct financial allocations to governments in developing countries, should be avoided as a matter of principle in view of the considerable risk of misuse. Disaster aid should also always be provided via professional organizations (Red Cross, Caritas, THW, etc.). The cooperation and funding of NGOs must be monitored with regard to political influence and prevented if necessary.

The European Union should decide as much as necessary and as little as possible centrally in the area of health policy - within the framework of the principle of subsidiarity.
The national level must have sole competence in areas of political action that can be meaningfully dealt with at national level. Centralized structures promote inefficient regulations and over-regulation and thus lead to even greater disenchantment with politics among citizens.
We therefore call for the responsibility for national health policy to remain in the parliaments of the respective EU member states. Responsibilities in the health sector must not be transferred to third parties such as NGOs or other private organizations. We strongly oppose a centralized and global health policy (e.g. by the WHO).
We reject the introduction of a digital vaccination certificate planned by the European Union, as this could have a negative impact on the civil liberties enshrined in the Basic Law.
Conversely, European cooperation should be expanded where it can be shaped in the interests of citizens and high-quality healthcare throughout Europe.
For example, cooperation in the area of joint evaluation of health technologies needs to be expanded in order to avoid repeating the same costly research activities many times over. The stockpiling of medicines and the expansion of production capacities to ensure effective healthcare provision in times of crisis, which can hardly be achieved by individual countries, is a task for which the European Union is predestined.
We are committed to ensuring that stricter uniform requirements apply, particularly in the area of animal husbandry, in order to put a stop to the further spread of antibiotic resistance across Europe. European data protection must also apply to highly sensitive health data in particular, unless patients explicitly consent to its use.
In the care sector, strengthening Europe-wide cooperation could be one way of tackling the persistent staff shortage.
In the field of sport, European funding models are worthy of support, provided they are not embedded in bureaucratic requirements and plans that inhibit rather than promote sporting activities.
EU PROGRAMS WHERE THEY INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN HEALTHCARE
Evaluating health technologies jointly at EU level
Bündnis Deutschland welcomes a strengthening of cooperation at EU level in the area of health technology assessment - as currently planned by the EU Commission - and proposes an expansion in terms of content.
This is because more and more people are placing their hopes in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) when it comes to medicines, medical products and measures to prevent diseases as well as diagnostic and treatment procedures.
Bündnis Deutschland is therefore committed to ensuring that these services are also included in the procedures for evaluating health technologies. This will allow the benefits and harms of all available health technologies to be presented in an evidence-based manner for the benefit of patients.
Strategically stockpiling pharmaceuticals and producing them in the EU
The supply difficulties, including for medicines during the coronavirus pandemic, were a warning sign. Efforts must be made to ensure that a basic supply of critical medicines, food and consumer goods is guaranteed even in times of international crisis.
74	75
Alliance Germany calls for the safeguarding of supply chains through strategic stockpiling of medicines and more investment in the production of medicines in Europe. The internal market for medicines must be de-bureaucratized and digitalized in order to avoid supply bottlenecks. Overall, independence from imports from outside the EU must be increased.
Inexpensive medicines (e.g. generics) generally cover the supply, but innovative medicines and therapies are sometimes offered at extremely high prices. This overburdens even financially well-equipped healthcare systems such as the German healthcare system.
Bündnis Deutschland is therefore calling for cooperation at EU level on pricing and reimbursement policy and for the pharmaceutical industry and the state to be made responsible for ensuring that modern medicines remain affordable in the long term. This is not a matter of "de-economization", but rather of quickly removing bureaucratic hurdles and creating political and economic framework conditions that are conducive to innovation and investment.
Resolutely leading the fight against antibiotic resistance
Bündnis Deutschland pursues a precautionary approach in the fight against antibiotic resistance. On the one hand, we rely on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in medicine and more restrictive use in agriculture, and on the other, we call for better infection prevention measures.
Various stakeholders must be made responsible for this: Every single EU citizen should be made aware of the problem (e.g. through campaigns as part of the European Antibiotic Awareness Day). Health and care facilities should guarantee hygiene measures based on best practice examples throughout. Practitioners and farmers should use antibiotics appropriately and according to the current state of knowledge.
With the "One Health Approach" of the German Antibiotic Resistance Strategy, the minimization concepts for the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and the specifications on reserve antibiotics for exclusive use in humans must be consistently advanced in addition to the required measures in the health sector.
Research into the possible transfer of antibiotic resistance from animal husbandry and animal foodstuffs to humans must be significantly intensified.
We are also committed to supporting and expanding the development of new antibiotics and combinations of active substances.
Ensuring data security when collecting health data
Every EU citizen must always have control over their own health data (e.g. from electronic health records, registers, apps and medical devices). We call for an opt-in regulation (consent regulation) for both the primary use and the secondary use of health data.
Only with the consent of the person concerned can the data be passed on to healthcare professionals of their choice quickly and in a simple, transparent and common format as part of primary use.
If consent is given for secondary use, the data can be passed on to researchers and innovators, political decision-makers and regulatory authorities after anonymization.
Revocation (in full or in relation to individual elements, e.g. with regard to certain diagnoses and interventions or with regard to certain user groups) must be possible at any time in a straightforward and barrier-free manner.
MORE EUROPEAN 
76	77
USING THE INTEGRATIVE 
COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF CARE
Creating Europe-wide programs for young people with an interest in nursing professions
Care facilities are important social institutions that can enable people to live a dignified and comfortable life in their last phase of life. They should not be subject to the profit motive, but should serve the common good. This requires sufficient funding as well as a qualified and motivated workforce. This cannot be guaranteed in the event of permanent overload due to staff shortages.
Unfortunately, the shortage of qualified specialists will become even more acute in the coming years. One possible way to tackle this problem is to promote the immigration of workers from other European Union member states who are willing to work in the care sector.
This involves not only the recruitment of trained nursing staff, but also the integration of auxiliary staff who can work in areas such as the kitchen and housekeeping. These assistants could relieve the burden on nursing staff by taking over routine tasks, thus allowing them to spend more time caring for patients.
It must be a task of the European Union to explore possible capacities here as part of a Europe-wide care plan and to make these available to member states with corresponding needs.
However, Europe must also be open to qualified nurses from other parts of the world and support them with language training in their own country for deployment in EU member states.
THROUGHOUT EUROPE
Maintaining sports promotion programs at European level
The EU should continue to promote sporting events at grassroots level through a simplified form of financial support, e.g. through existing programs such as Erasmus+. In any case, it makes sense for the respective sports associations to exchange experiences in order to learn from each other and improve their own structures.
No to a bureaucratic European sports model
We reject the standardization of a European sports model. Money should flow into sport and not into additional bureaucratic requirements that hinder the actual running of sport.
79
Our image of humanity is that of a free and self-reliant person who can build his or her life on the basis of proven cultural patterns, knowledge and traditions. We therefore oppose all attempts to devalue or even deny the foundations of human identity, be it the region, the country, the common cultural heritage or gender.
Bonding with others - whether in the family, among friends or in the home environment - strengthens people's satisfaction, joie de vivre and resilience. Politics should promote bonds between people and not hinder them. People's involvement in communities and institutions - for example in the family, the church, the volunteer fire department, a sports club or a political party - has an intrinsic moral value.
Such commitment is conducive to Europe's prosperity. However, it also promotes and stabilizes the well-being of the individual, who is enriched by others in their various roles and enriches others. Volunteering thus prevents the increasing isolation of people and the associated increase in mental illnesses.
We recognize rural areas as cultural assets and want to further strengthen their quality of life. The preservation of our formative cultural landscapes is of great importance to us. Bündnis Deutschland would like to promote the natural interdependence of our towns and villages with their rural environment and also steer the construction of suburban belts according to this criterion.
Culture is created anew every day - we promote this. Culture is also lost every day - we slow that down. We stand for diversity instead of ideological simplicity.

The appearance of cities around the world is currently being harmonized by concrete buildings. Bündnis Deutschland would also like to breathe new life into the cultural diversity of our continent in construction.
We therefore advocate the promotion of regional architectural styles. As a result, Brussels funding should in future be used preferentially for construction projects that fit in with the local appearance and regional architectural tradition. In this way, Europe will remain diverse, varied and worth living in.
Promoting regional media offerings - ensuring diversity of opinion
We consider diversity of opinion in the Member States to be a valuable asset. The countless private regional press products and radio and television stations make an elementary contribution to this. The survival of these offerings is desirable in terms of pluralism of opinion in our democracy. We therefore want to encourage the member states of the European Union in Brussels to improve the tax position of regional media providers.
support the EU language policy as a direct expression of the friendly relationship between the peoples of Europe. Foreign language teaching is an important part of education in order to open up new horizons for young people.
It must not (only) be about the direct economic benefit; the exchange between cultures must remain a central aspect of foreign language teaching. For this reason, we advocate that foreign language teaching throughout Europe should not be limited to English alone, but should include at least one other European language.
Preserving European regional languages, supporting linguistic minorities
We also support measures aimed at preserving and passing on the numerous European regional languages, such as Sorbian and Danish in Germany. We are particularly in favor of promoting the German language among the German-speaking minorities in neighboring European countries, such as Poland, Romania and Belgium.
The European Union should work to ensure that the Member States take their obligation to preserve such regional languages seriously and that they do not fall victim to linguistic centralist tendencies.
NO TO SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION FROM ABOVE, YES TO THE FAMILY
Stop EU plans for the EU Parental Certificate
82	83
DIGITALIZATION AS A CHALLENGE & OPPORTUNITY
Digitalization as a challenge
A family traditionally consists of a father, mother and children. Women and men each bring individual gender-specific aspects to parenting that complement each other.
Families are the nucleus of our society and the state is committed to actively protecting and promoting them.
People are communal beings for whom the family forms a firm anchor in the stages of their lives, from birth, through school, working life and starting their own family, to retirement and the end of their lives.
We are clearly opposed to the EU's current plans to introduce a parenthood certificate. Such a certificate is intended to force EU member states to accept the socio-political ideas prevailing in other EU countries and to implement them within the framework of national administration.
We reject the transformation of social realities by EU bureaucracy and thus bypassing democratic processes.
The digitalization of society enables more efficient and user-friendly processes. In addition, internet users have almost unlimited opportunities for information and participation. At the same time, however, digitalization also presents us with major ethical challenges that are being neglected in the current debate.
In this and recent years alone, several administrative processes relating to digitization have been massively advanced at European and national level, mostly without sufficient discussion in society and the media: the European digital identity, the digital euro, the digital medical record, the digital vaccination certificate.
Immediate consequential problems of these measures arise in the area of data protection. The rampant collection of personal data is accompanied by an expansion of state control and access options. There is a threat of the transparent individual.
The issue of social participation is also affected by digitalization. It is important - not only for older people - to enable spaces for personal encounters. We all know that digital video conferencing cannot replace a real conversation. We firmly believe that public administration, healthcare, education and all other areas of human life require physical encounters. On the one hand for reasons of inclusion and participation, and on the other to limit state control options and safeguard civil privacy.
There are also other aspects: The omnipresence of search engines, social media and artificial intelligence not only leads to dependencies and even addiction, but also demonstrably inhibits social behavior, curiosity and creativity. All characteristics that make us human in the first place!
84	85
The human social being must not be understood exclusively as a digital entity. If humanity slams the door on the analog world, there may be no turning back.
Digital offerings such as social media, video games or the recently propagated meta- verse are not bad per se. However, they are also not, as their proponents would have us believe, good per se and beneficial for humanity. The aim cannot be to make us dependent on digital systems. Instead, we need to actively shape this process. The focus must be on people as social beings.
Bündnis Deutschland is therefore calling for a "right to digital self-determination". Essentially, it is about preventing the analog reality from being pulled out from under the feet of human life. Progressive and fundamentally helpful digitalization must not lead to a loss of humanity. If we do not face up to this problem, it will have grave consequences for our social coexistence and democracy as a whole.
Under no circumstances should we allow ourselves to be degraded to digital objects and become dependent on digital corporations that pursue their power and business interests.
In addition, the state, with its bureaucratic administrative processes, must not be tempted into control mechanisms that appear "efficient" on the surface but actually restrict the freedom of citizens.
Digitalization as an opportunity
Digitalization has brought about major changes worldwide in recent years and influences almost all aspects of our social lives. In this context, the role of citizens plays a key role.
In order to fully exploit the benefits of digitalization and at the same time overcome potential challenges, it is essential that citizens are trained and open to digitalization.
Germany must develop into a leading digital metropolis and this will only succeed if citizens are placed at the center of the digitalization strategy. This includes training programs that enable citizens to learn and use digital skills. These training courses are far- reaching and cover all age groups, from young children to senior citizens, and are offered both in schools and in community centers.
Only by involving citizens in our country's digitalization strategy can Germany create an open- minded citizenry that actively supports digital progress and preserves its own digital sovereignty. Whether we like it or not, the digitalization of the world is happening and if we do not actively shape it, Germany will be the loser.

Preamble
Leading Europe to new security and strength
For us, a united Europe is a project of peace and freedom. Integrated into the transatlantic partnership, Europe has given the peoples of the continent, and us Germans in particular, the security that a free and good life needs.
Europe is proof that we can learn from history; that we humans are not trapped in a cycle of war and peace, but that a better future is always possible. A united Europe is the basis for a life in freedom and prosperity.
The CDU and CSU are the German European parties. It was largely personalities from our ranks who made European unification possible through their intelligent and courageous actions. A united Europe is a valuable legacy for us. We are taking on this responsibility for the people of Germany and for future generations: They too should be able to live in freedom and security in Europe.
We need Europe and Europe needs us.
The upcoming European elections are groundbreaking. The European security space is under threat from outside and within, and with it Germany's security. Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine is a daily reminder that peace is fragile and freedom must be defended. The rise of China is fundamentally changing the balance of power in the world. The digital transformation, artificial intelligence and the fight against climate change are changing the economic world dramatically.
The transatlantic partnership with the USA is strong, but we need to do more for it. The rise of extremist, anti-liberal forces and anti-Western parallel societies threaten the foundations of the European project and liberal democracy. These challenges demand our full commitment to our Europe. We are convinced that the European Union can do better. In order to continue its success story in the future, the EU must focus on the central common tasks. It must be there for the people. It must offer our companies and employees concrete added value within the framework of the social market economy.
For a Europe of common security.
The European Union, supported by strong nation states, offers all the prerequisites to reliably protect us Europeans. We make policy for a strong Europe that delivers on this security promise. We want a better common foreign and security policy that makes Europe a capable actor and a strong voice in the world. We are doing everything we can to protect Europe's borders against irregular migration. We advocate a policy that brings together the economy, energy, climate and social cohesion and ensures that Europe can be a world leader in technology. We are committed to a policy of sound finances.
Europe, united in diversity and secure: on the basis of a common spiritual, religious and cultural heritage, Europe has founded a unique "European way of life". Respect for human dignity, peace and freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, social and ecological responsibility - that is what makes us Europeans special. That is what we are working for. We want to lead Europe to new security and strength.
I. Peace and freedom for Europe with security
Only those who live in security can be free. Ensuring freedom and security is the most important task of Europe and Germany. This involves both internal and external security.
1. Defending Europe and securing peace
The security situation in Europe has changed fundamentally in recent years, particularly as a result of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. It is clear that we need to do much more for Europe's security and resilience. We need a comprehensive security agenda for the EU.
Renewing the promise of peace and security for Europe. We want to remain transatlantic and become more European. Europe needs an effective common foreign and security policy. Our goal is a security and defense community. We want to strengthen European defense cooperation within the EU and NATO. The national armed forces should work together more closely in a strong European defense union. The United Kingdom, as a leading European military power, should also be integrated in the best possible way. We pursue the goal of European armed forces in the sense of a strengthened European defense union, embedded in the structures of NATO, in order to be jointly capable of defense.
Create a genuine defense union. Europe must take more responsibility in NATO and expand its own military capabilities. The threat from Russia is real. It affects the whole of Europe and will permanently challenge our defense capabilities. The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine at the latest has revealed that too little has been invested in defense. We need a single European market and not national pettiness. This applies to military equipment just as much as it does to common export rules in arms production.
We want to develop and procure military equipment such as combat aircraft, battle tanks, drones and aircraft carriers together with European partners. We need a defense industrial strategy so that the European defense industry grows and key industries for Europe's security remain in Europe. With the EU's next long-term budget (Multiannual Financial Framework/MFF), we want to significantly increase funding for innovation and for the fulfillment of our military
needs in order to complement the defense efforts of the Member States.
We are in favor of building a joint missile defense shield. Europe must make a greater contribution to deterrence through the NATO alliance as a whole. We want to improve the existing civilian and military planning and management structures in the EU. We need a comprehensive security agenda for the EU. It must be developed in close cooperation between member states and NATO. We need an EU Commissioner for Defense - even in a reduced Commission.
Giving new impetus to Franco-German cooperation. Franco-German friendship is and will remain a decisive driving force for European integration. We do not see it as exclusive, but as an initial spark for courageous steps in the EU. Our other partners in Europe know how important it is for Germany and France to provide impetus and direction with commitment and passion. Together with the new Polish government, we want to revive the Weimar Triangle - the special cooperation between France, Poland and Germany.
Cooperate more with the Central and Eastern European states. The enlargement of the European Union 20 years ago was a historic step and a milestone in the history of European unification. We want to promote cooperation with the Central and Eastern European member states in particular. We need fast train connections to Poland and the Czech Republic. We are focusing on expanding the transport infrastructure and scientific cooperation. Cooperation in the border region is particularly important to us, as it allows people to experience Europe first-hand.
Full support for our partners - especially in the event of a crisis. Ukraine must continue to receive our full support in the fight for its freedom and territorial integrity. A Russia that is waging this criminal war of aggression cannot be a partner. War crimes in Ukraine must be punished by a war crimes tribunal. We hope that a different Russia, which adheres to a rule-based international order, can one day be won back as a calculable political and economic partner.
Supporting the reconstruction of Ukraine. As Europeans, we feel a responsibility to support Ukraine's reconstruction with all our strength. To this end, we also want to enter into reconstruction partnerships, for example in the raw materials and energy sectors, with the involvement of private capital. We want to examine whether Russia and Russian assets can be used to cover the costs of reconstruction.
Strengthen Europe as a geopolitical player in global systemic competition. In an increasingly uncertain world, Europe must take more responsibility for itself. We want to achieve an EU position in the Common Foreign and Security Policy more quickly. policy (CFSP) and will therefore vote by qualified majority in future. This respects the fundamental balance of power in the EU. In addition, the position of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is to be expanded. We want to strengthen the role of the European External Action Service.
The USA is and will remain our close partner. The transatlantic friendship must remain a cornerstone of our foreign policy. Israel is an important and friendly partner of Germany and Europe. We stand by Israel's right to exist without any ifs or buts.
Europe's relationship with China must be based on a rules-based order. We support the "Global Gateway Initiative", which aims to contribute to the development of the
EU partner states, particularly in Africa, by activating private capital. It is therefore also a response to China's "New Silk Road". We want to strengthen Europe's relationship with the global South and in particular with Latin America, the Indo-Pacific region and our direct neighboring continent of Africa through economic and trade partnerships and development cooperation. We also need a security strategy for Africa and the Mediterranean region.
2. Ensuring security, fighting crime
Organized crime, crime and terrorism are challenging internal security throughout Europe. We need to better protect our citizens in their everyday lives.
Fighting cross-border crime. We want to strengthen and further improve Europol's cooperation with the police forces of the Member States. This is how we fight organized crime and, in particular, drugs and
smuggling, cybercrime and terrorism more effectively. We want to better network the data systems of national and international security authorities in order to disrupt the flow of money from criminals, for example. We want to strengthen the instrument of the European arrest warrant.
We are declaring war on extremists, Islamists and anti-Semites. Anti-Semitism in all its forms has no place in Europe and must be resolutely combated at all levels.
Stopping violence against women across Europe. Violence against women is one of the least prosecuted and punished crimes in the world. This must change. To this end, we want to consistently punish violence against women throughout Europe. In particular, the aim is to improve the coordination of criminal prosecution (e.g. combating human trafficking, restrictive prostitution policy). The "Istanbul Convention" on combating violence against women and domestic violence must be implemented.
Better protect children with a European action plan. We want to better protect our children from child sexual abuse. Crimes of this kind are abhorrent. All instruments of the rule of law to protect children must be used consistently. We advocate the storage of IP addresses for all serious crimes, especially in the fight against child abuse in accordance with the requirements of the European Court of Justice. Traces must also be secured at the digital crime scene. We also want to better protect children online from cyberbullying and grooming. To this end, cyberbullying should be treated as a criminal offense throughout Europe. We reject a general chat control.
Better warning of new scams. We want to increase Europol's added value for citizens: criminals use the same tricks everywhere, such as shock calls, grandchildren tricks, WhatsApp scams or all forms of fraud, especially online. We want Europol to evaluate these scams across Europe and use apps, for example, to raise public awareness and warn people about them.
Improve cyber security, fight hate speech online. We want to further develop the EU's cybercrime management and improve cooperation in the fight against cyber threats and disinformation. Europe must become more independent when it comes to cyber security technologies. We want a European cyber brigade
build up. We will also take more intensive action against incitement, hatred and disinformation online. We are countering this insidious poison.
3. Limiting migration through humanity and order
We cannot do without the legal immigration of skilled workers who want to work here and lend a hand. We are firmly committed to our humanitarian obligation to help persecuted people. At the same time, irregular migration poses considerable problems for the EU as a whole and Germany in particular. We want to stop this immigration. That is why we support the new European migration pact. The results are important steps in the right direction and must be implemented as quickly as possible. We will continue to pursue this path consistently.
Facilitate the immigration of qualified skilled workers. Germany must become more attractive for skilled workers and procedures must be processed purely digitally. The relevant work visas must be issued quickly if all the requirements for working in Germany are met. However, we want to stop the sale of visas and EU passports by member states.
Protect external borders, strengthen Frontex. We need better surveillance of the EU's external borders and - wherever necessary - structural border protection. After all, it is the state authorities and not criminal networks of people smugglers that should decide who enters the EU. The European border protection agency Frontex must become a genuine border police force and coast guard with sovereign powers and 30,000 border guards that can effectively stop irregular migration. Until the external border guard functions, border controls at internal borders must remain possible. The border controls with Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland introduced in autumn 2023 and the controls with Austria that have been in place for years show that internal border controls, while maintaining freedom of movement, lead to a decrease in irregular migration. It is clear to us that the border control-free Schengen area is a major European achievement.
Implement the concept of safe third countries. Everyone who applies for asylum in Europe should be taken to a safe third country outside the EU and undergo a procedure there. It must be made possible for asylum procedures to take place in safe third countries that meet all constitutional requirements. If they are recognized, the safe third country should grant them protection. We are in favor of
We assume that, following the successful implementation of the third country concept, a coalition of the willing within the EU will take in a contingent of people in need of protection from abroad each year and distribute them accordingly. We want to harmonize social benefits in the EU for asylum seekers and persons entitled to protection, taking into account the purchasing power of the member states.
Effectively combating the causes of flight. Many refugees make their way to Europe for humanly understandable reasons. The primary goal must be to provide assistance in the countries of origin and transit and to open up prospects for people in their home countries.
Conclude agreements with transit countries and countries of origin. We welcome the fact that the EU has entered into a partnership package with Tunisia. We need more such agreements with Egypt, for example, and a renewed EU-Turkey agreement.
II. With security, prosperity and competitiveness
Germany can only be a strong business location in a strong Europe. Our country owes a considerable part of its economic success to the European single market with the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. Our prosperity cannot be taken for granted. It has to be earned again and again.
A successful economy needs good framework conditions. We want to strengthen the competitiveness of companies in Germany and Europe through a smart location policy. We therefore promote research, innovation and digitalization. We want intensive free trade and a deepened EU single market. Our goal is for Europe to be a global leader in the technologies of the future.
1. The European single market is our lifeline
Deepening the EU internal market. The internal market is the engine of integration in Europe and a key pillar of our economic success. We want to make the further development and completion of the EU internal market a central project for the future of the EU. This applies in particular to the future areas of energy, health, digitization, telecommunications and the capital market. Remaining obstacles in the
cross-border trade in goods and services as quickly as possible.
Strengthen Europe as a location for industry and SMEs. Our companies need the best framework conditions. This includes, in particular, secure and affordable energy. We will consistently reduce dependencies on key technologies and critical raw materials. Our goal is to establish raw material and energy partnerships with reliable partners. In this way, we want to support the framework conditions for the automotive industry, basic materials industry, SMEs and the skilled trades, aviation and energy-intensive industry, among others. We advocate a risk-based approach to chemicals policy and oppose blanket bans on entire classes of substances.
Giving SMEs their own voice in Europe. We want to strengthen the European SME Envoy for our SMEs. In future, he should also be involved in all European legislative procedures and be obliged to check the application of the SME tests.
Right of way for more competition and good jobs. We want to facilitate entrepreneurial activity with a European competition strategy. It is particularly important for competition with other regions of the world that intellectual property continues to be effectively protected. We advocate a review of the taxonomy and the Green Deal in terms of their practicality and also with regard to international competition. We reject the current draft of the EU Supply Chain Act. To this end, we want to carry out a success and efficiency review. Measures towards a more sustainable
economic model must be designed in a practical way and must not slow down economic dynamism.
Declare a freeze on new regulations. We want to put an end to the overregulation of the economy by imposing an immediate freeze on new and ongoing EU initiatives. We want to consolidate complex EU legislation, consolidate reporting obligations for companies and abolish superfluous EU rules such as those on whistleblowers. In addition, we want to create an independent European Regulatory Scrutiny Board that measures the costs of bureaucracy and also takes into account the experience in the member states with the application of EU law. We want to enforce the "1 in, 2 out" principle - for every new burdensome regulation, two old ones must be abolished - and thus noticeably reduce bureaucracy. We need an EU
Competitiveness check and an action plan to reduce the regulatory burden. New rules may only be transposed 1:1 into national law.
Making Europe the center of performance. We want to strengthen cooperation between the innovative regions in Europe on the one hand and the regions in the transformation process on the other. Europe should become the number 1 location for start-ups. They need low-threshold market access, less bureaucracy and better access to available capital.
Launch new European free trade initiatives. The EU needs a strategic trade policy that promotes mutual access to open markets, guarantees security of supply and reduces dependencies in key areas. We want to conclude more free trade agreements, especially with the USA and South America, without overburdening them with extraneous issues. The same applies to agreements in the Asia-Pacific region, for example with India, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand. In future, free trade agreements should only be concluded as EU-only agreements. There is also a need for better access for European companies to foreign digital markets, particularly with regard to interoperability. The World Trade Organization (WTO) must be further developed. The security of trade routes is also part of functioning trade. Where necessary, we must also protect trade routes militarily against piracy or violent attacks.
2. Research, innovation and digitalization for a sovereign Europe
Strengthening research, innovation and modern infrastructure. With an offensive for research and innovation as well as a strong EU research framework program, we will achieve a pioneering role for the EU in the development of key technologies. We focus on innovation leadership and openness to technology. Research funding must be awarded primarily according to the criterion of scientific excellence. Our goal is for a total of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) to be invested in research and development in the EU. We want to invest more in the expansion of trans-European transport networks
- also to strengthen military mobility.
And Europe needs sovereign access to space and independent satellite-based communication in Europe. This must be underpinned by a long-term strategy.
Strengthen technological sovereignty. We want a Europe that understands, develops and produces key technologies. It is necessary to reduce dependencies and therefore diversify supply chains. In addition, we must be more cautious when exporting sensitive technologies and when importing and using security-relevant components. Chips and battery cells are and will be
In the 21st century, chips are central components of more and more products. To ensure that more chips are produced in Europe and Germany, we want to quickly fill the European Chip Act with life. To this end, we will use the European Semiconductor Alliance ESRA to further promote economic and scientific cooperation.
We want artificial intelligence, not artificial bureaucracy. Europe should become the center for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital innovation based on our ethical principles that serves people. We want to promote and accelerate research, support the development of applications and enable freedom. In this sense, we want to enable AI and use it for economic growth and progress for society, e.g. in the healthcare sector. We must manage its risks, but under no circumstances should we miss out on the opportunities and benefits of AI through over-regulation. The new regulations must not stifle innovation in AI.
Driving forward the digital single market. We want a genuine digital and data union with modern competition law and first-class digital infrastructure, in particular a European cloud, as well as European storage and data capacities. We need nationwide access to 5G and 6G in every region. Our goal is a sovereign and competitive European digital economy that can set recognized technological and legal standards worldwide in coordination with our international partners. Digital markets and technological developments need as much freedom as possible and only as much regulation as necessary. We want to break down data silos, facilitate data sharing and create data spaces. We are making the internet a safer, more transparent and fairer marketplace.
Making data protection simpler and more innovation-friendly. The privacy of citizens is and remains a valuable asset. But data protection law is too complicated in Europe. Data is the raw material of the 21st century. We therefore want a much simpler and more uniform data protection law that is also applied in the same way throughout the EU. This requires a reform of the General Data Protection Regulation. The following applies
the principle that due diligence obligations belong in sensitive areas. We welcome the fact that the EU wants to enable data spaces such as the European Health Data Space. In these data spaces, the sharing of data is to be facilitated in compliance with data protection law.
Simplify public procurement. Above a certain order volume, international and above all European law prescribe how federal, state and local authorities must award contracts. The threshold values above which a Europe-wide invitation to tender is required have not been adjusted to inflation for years. We therefore want to raise them significantly to enable more straightforward contract awards. Overall, the entire public procurement law needs to be reviewed and significantly simplified.
Simplify planning law and abolish the right to sue associations. Our aim is to review all applicable environmental guidelines relevant to infrastructure projects. In addition, planning must not be delayed by excessive participation and late submission of objections in legal protection proceedings.
3. Thinking economy, energy and climate together
We do not see the economy, energy and climate protection as opposites, but as one. Without a competitive economy, there can be no sustainable climate protection, and without climate protection measures, there can be no sustainable modernization of our economy. That is why we want a secure supply of energy and raw materials. We shape climate protection with people and companies, not against them. All sectors should be supported in converting their production methods to be climate-friendly. In doing so, we rely on innovation and research as well as market-based instruments. We also support the regions in climate protection and climate adaptation.
We are committed to technological openness in the economy, energy and climate protection. We are committed to the goal of climate neutrality in Europe by 2050. On the way there, we rely on innovative concepts and market-based instruments: with emissions trading, social compensation, the expansion of renewable energies, energy efficiency and a circular economy. Our aim is also to unlock investment in innovations for clean technologies. We want to support this and gain more strategic sovereignty in the field of future technologies. This is how we want the Green Deal in the
to become more business-friendly. With innovative technologies, Europe will set an example for international climate protection.
Promote all renewable energies equally. Renewable energy is an essential factor for successful climate protection. We therefore want to promote photovoltaics, wind power, geothermal energy, hydropower, liquid and solid biomass (e.g. wood) equally and create a level playing field.
Achieving energy security and sovereignty with the Energy Union. Germany and Europe need a secure and affordable energy supply. We want to strengthen the single market for energy, develop and expand cross-border infrastructure and promote Europe as an energy location with research that is open to all technologies. In the case of hydrogen, we need a rapid ramp-up of European and international production and a functioning transport infrastructure with a cross-border pipeline network. We stand for an ambitious and swift implementation of the EU hydrogen strategy. In order to secure the necessary future demand for hydrogen imports, we want to establish more energy partnerships with reliable partners. We want to intensify research in the field of energy, climate and materials research and promote Europe as a research location for innovative nuclear technologies suchas nuclear fusion. For us, the energy mix includes all renewable energies as well as nuclear power - we cannot do without this option at present.
Driving forward the circular economy, using raw materials responsibly. In addition to the recycling of waste, the circular economy also includes the circular use of water and heat. We want to close material cycles and improve the longevity of products.
Establish a circular CO2 economy across Europe. We want to strengthen natural sinks (e.g. moors, soils, forests), technical sinks (i.e. industrial capture and storage) and, above all, the use of CO2 throughout Europe. Only with CCS and CCU technologies can we achieve climate neutrality through negative emissions. To achieve this, we need a reliable framework and a Europe-wide CO2 infrastructure. In addition, direct CO2 capture from the air must be supported with the first ambitious pilot projects and integration into emissions trading.
Creating a future perspective for the clean combustion engine. We stand by the car, regardless of the drive type. We want to abolish the ban on combustion engines and maintain Germany's cutting-edge combustion engine technology and develop it further in a technology-neutral way. Synthetic fuels play a central role in this. We do not prescribe any technologies.
Safeguarding natural resources, adapting to climate change. Protecting biodiversity and precious resources such as water and forests is our insurance for the future.
Climate adaptation and sustainable management are core European tasks. To this end, we want to find best-practice examples, particularly in coastal and flood protection measures.
4. Securing regional food production
Our farmers produce high-quality food and make an invaluable contribution to food security as well as environmental, climate, species and resource protection. They guarantee value creation in the regions with valuable jobs and sustainable production and use of raw materials. They deserve appreciation and recognition for this. We want our farmers to be able to continue to operate well in the future. That is why we are committed to improving the framework conditions in agriculture. In doing so, we focus primarily on incentives and support rather than bans.
Focus on food security and the economic prospects for farmers. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) must have a strong economic pillar that offers farmers protection in volatile markets and allows them to farm sustainably and earn a sufficient income. Direct payments should be a genuine reward for the diverse services provided by agriculture and be greatly simplified.
Shaping the future together with agriculture. We stand by the side of our farmers. The strategic dialog initiated by the President of the EU Commission should be continued and expanded: We want to shape the future together with all farmers.
Secure livestock grazing - lower the protection status of the wolf. Herd protection measures alone are not enough to ensure a future for livestock grazing in Europe. In many areas, we need a wolf management system that limits the number of wolves and allows wolves to be shot when densities are high. Comparable adaptations are also needed for other large predators.
Investment in agriculture as a high-tech sector. We want a strong impulse for precision agriculture, new breeding technologies, integrated pest management and the use of robotics in agriculture.
No excessive requirements for our farmers. This applies in particular to new rules on the sustainable use of pesticides, set-asides and bureaucracy. The EU obligation to set aside 4% of agricultural land will be abolished. There needs to be an immediate stop to burdens on agriculture.
Developing rural areas into regions of the future. With us, rural development will remain a focus of EU policy. In addition to agriculture and forestry, we want to strengthen the bioeconomy, renewable energies and tourism in rural regions and take advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalization.
5. Improving health and the supply of medicines
The coronavirus pandemic has clearly shown that even the best national healthcare system can never protect against a pandemic on its own. The pandemic has also clearly demonstrated Europe's dependence on other countries for the supply of medicines. Europe must therefore join forces to make important progress in the fight against serious diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. We want to create a health union, but one that does not lead to the standardization of healthcare systems. Future technologies such as artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to make decisive progress in health and the fight against cancer.
These potentials must be exploited to the full in a European alliance - taking ethical issues into account.
Creating a Health Union. Our goal is a European Health Union for research and innovation, where cutting-edge research and first-class applications go hand in hand and intellectual property is protected. We need a European Health Union that enables and exchanges knowledge and innovation. To this end
we want to drive forward the initiatives for a genuine European Health Data Space. We want to implement the digital European patient file. We are committed to prevention and the Europe-wide outlawing of drugs. We firmly reject social experiments such as the legalization of hashish or other drugs for recreational use. We therefore do not want cannabis to be legalized.
Europe must once again become the pharmacy of the world. We want to create investment-friendly framework conditions for the pharmaceutical industry so that more medicines, such as antibiotics and children's medicines, are once again manufactured in production facilities in Europe. This includes comprehensive patent protection and more diverse supply chains. This is how we counter the shortage of medicines and take precautions.
Fighting serious diseases together and fully implementing the European Cancer Plan. Europe must join forces to make important progress in the fight against serious diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. We are in favor of a European plan for cardiovascular health and an EU action plan for mental health. Europe must also continue to expand its leading role in vaccine development in order to be best prepared for a possible next pandemic.
Further develop health policy. We support the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as well as EU activities for better health security and international crisis preparedness.
Develop a European care strategy. We need improved networks and innovative structures for the best care and less loneliness. We reject a shift of responsibilities to European level. Instead, we want a better exchange in the field of care, better research funding and better recruitment of care workers.
Shaping driving license law with sense and reason. Mobility is individual freedom - especially for people in rural areas. Our aim is therefore to maintain the current validity period of driving licenses. We reject the introduction of medical tests for older people.
6. Ensuring secure finances and a sound budgetary policy
The guarantee for a strong EU is a reliable and stability-oriented financial policy. It is central to the lasting cohesion of our community of states and the prerequisite for attractive framework conditions for private investment.
For a genuine stability union, against a debt union. We want a responsible fiscal policy in Europe. Each member state is liable for its own debts. We clearly reject all forms of German liability for the debts of other states or for savings deposits in other states (deposit guarantee). To ensure sustainable budget management, instruments must also be created to ensure compliance. Borrowing to finance the Corona Reconstruction Fund in the emergency situation of the pandemic must remain an exception. We call on the Commission to draw up a concrete roadmap for the repayment of the recovery fund. European funds must not be allowed to flow into the social programs of the Member States.
Preserve the Stability and Growth Pact. This pact is about a precautionary budgetary policy. Both the debt ratio of 60 % of GDP and the annual deficit criterion of 3 % of GDP must remain binding for all Member States. Violations of the stability criteria must be consistently sanctioned.
structural and investment funds to improve competitiveness. We support a cohesion policy that promotes the equal development of all European regions, especially rural areas, and structurally strengthens Europe's competitiveness. The eastern German states owe their development primarily to the efforts of their citizens and solidarity within Germany, but also to support from the EU. For the next funding period in structural and cohesion policy, we want to ensure continued support for the eastern German states, structurally weak areas and transition regions throughout Germany.
The European Central Bank (ECB) must maintain monetary stability and combat inflation. We are committed to the independence of the ECB and to its mandate, which is limited exclusively to monetary stability and banking supervision. Monetary and financial policy must remain separate. We must oppose the planned enlargement of the EU to the
This is an opportunity to change the distribution of votes in the ECB Governing Council. Our goal is a voting weight in relation to the size of the economy and the liability risk of the individual country. We are keeping the euro stable as a currency. In addition to the adjustment of interest rates by the ECB, budgetary discipline and a reduction of excessive debt levels by the member states are essential steps to effectively combat inflation.
Preserve cash. The important fight against money laundering must not be confused with an unnecessary fight against cash. We are committed to the preservation of cash.
Further develop the capital markets union, reduce risks in the banking system. We want to make Europe and Germany a strong financial center that sets international standards and provides European companies with the capital they need. We want to deepen the Capital Markets Union and strengthen the single market for financial services. We reject taxpayer-funded bank bailouts and the communitization of liability assumption within the framework of the European deposit guarantee scheme.
Regulate financial markets in the service of citizens and businesses. The financial economy must play a serving and stabilizing role for the real economy. The financial markets should not become independent. Our German three-pillar system of private banks, public-sector banks and cooperative banks has proven its worth. We are in favor of strict regulation of the global financial market, which nevertheless takes into account the differences in our banking system.
7. Securing a sustainable working world
A well-functioning economy with a sustainable labor market is an important prerequisite for people to live independently. Work is valuable because it guarantees material security, creates identity and participation. At the same time, good tax revenues and social contributions enable the member states to finance their welfare state with secure pensions, a good healthcare and care system and help for the most vulnerable.
For a modern working world and a socially secure Europe. We want a strong labor market with many employees covered by social insurance and fairly paid jobs. We are committed to labor law and social protection standards for all employees. We stand for a social Europe in which people work, the economy is booming and the member states can finance an efficient welfare state with their tax revenues. This is how we help people in need. A high level of employment ensures strong social security systems. We want to increase collective bargaining coverage. However, we reject a European unemployment insurance scheme.
Improve the free movement of workers. We want to improve employee mobility in Europe and quickly standardize the social security and labor law regulations for the posting of employees (e.g. so-called A1 certificates). We want to make business trips and cross-border work easier. This will help people in border regions in particular. However, we will put an end to employment relationships that are only entered into or maintained in order to r e c e i v e abusive social benefits in Germany.
Tackling the skills shortage in Germany on a European scale. We want to get more people into work. By improving the compatibility of family and career, we want to enable women in particular to switch from part-time to full-time work. We want to increase the proportion of women in science, research, mathematics and engineering. At the same time, the skills of young people from all over Europe must be promoted and used to combat the shortage of skilled workers in Germany. In particular, all obstacles that still exist with regard to the freedom of movement of workers must be removed.
Create fair working conditions, including for platform work. There must also be fair working conditions for cross-border employees. We want to ensure that the important standards for employee protection also apply to the many employees on digital platforms and that they are adhered to.
Strengthen education and training mobility to combat youth unemployment. The Member States should further simplify recognition procedures and transparency instruments for vocational education and training.
Introducing the European Disability Card. We welcome the decision to introduce the European Disability Card, which will simplify barrier-free travel in the EU as an additional document. An information portal for barrier-free travel is needed. We support the EU in supplementing national measures for people with disabilities.
Supporting the European cultural and creative sector. The cultural and creative sector is an important part of our society and a profession in its own right. As such, we want to support it in its sustainable and digital transformation and protect it from the misuse of content. We are therefore committed to protecting copyright, particularly in the music, film and literature industries.
III. Certainly more cohesion in Europe
We want a Europe that is regionally rooted, nationally supported and legitimized at European level and that is there for its citizens. At the same time, we advocate an EU that works better and focuses on the essentials.
Our aim is to strengthen the European community of values and thus also cohesion among Europeans. Especially in these difficult times, strong cooperation is indispensable. We are committed to a leading European culture that is characterized by respect for human dignity, freedom, the rule of law, tolerance and solidarity with one another. At the same time, our aim is to promote social cohesion between the generations. In doing so, we focus on marriage and family as the nucleus of our society and honor the life achievements of older generations.
1. For a Europe that inspires young people
Our Europe stands for the "European way of life". Young people are the future of Europe. That is why we want to promote and further intensify encounters between young Europeans.
Promoting the mobility of young people. We want to strengthen youth exchanges and volunteer programs in Europe and provide more comprehensive support for young people's mobility, for example by expanding "DiscoverEU".
Strengthening exchange in vocational training. Our goal is for more trainees in particular to participate in exchange programs with other EU countries. To this end, the advisory and support services in Germany must be expanded and brought together under one national umbrella.
Supporting young people through Erasmus+. We are committed to the expansion and financial increase of the Erasmus+ program, which enables students, trainees and pupils to complete part of their education abroad in Europe.
Recognize certificates and diplomas in the European Education Area. We want to develop criteria that ensure the comparability of educational qualifications in all areas (schools, universities and vocational training) - without undermining established structures.
Protect press and media freedom. A framework is needed that does justice to the developments in the modern media world. The European Media Freedom Act is a clear step forward for pluralism and better combating disinformation. Especially in times of hybrid external threats, we must strengthen press and media freedom at EU level.
2. Strengthening the EU's ability to act
The EU must become more capable of acting - both internally and externally. This requires reforms to the EU institutions and the way they work. Only in this way can the EU provide answers to the challenges of the future.
More Europe where Europe can do more. We need an EU that concentrates on those tasks that can be performed better at European level than at national, regional and local level. This applies above all to internal and external security, migration, the economy, trade, energy and climate protection. The instrument of "enhanced cooperation" in the sense of a Europe of pioneers should also be used more frequently.
EU enlargement and reform must go hand in hand. In future, the EU should reach united positions on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) more quickly and therefore vote by qualified majority in future.
This respects the fundamental balance of power in the EU. The EU Commission also needs to be restructured and streamlined. We will strengthen the European Parliament through its own right of initiative and the principle of discontinuity, according to which all unapproved drafts must be reintroduced in a new legislative period. We support the EPP's lead candidate, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, for re-election as Commission President in 2024. For an EU enlargement to be possible at all, the EU must first reform itself. We want to take the necessary measures to make the EU fit for the future and develop it further.
We stand by the principle of subsidiarity, and the EU must return to this. We want a catalog of competences and a check for institutions in order to identify common main objectives. However, this must also take into account the competences that are the responsibility of the Member States. We reject an increase in the number of EU staff. We must create a greater awareness of local realities in the EU authorities.
Defending the rule of law. The existing procedure for protecting the EU's fundamental values in the EU Treaty and the new EU rule of law mechanism offer the necessary scope for action to sanction serious violations of fundamental values by individual Member States. We must make use of this.
Enhancing the diversity of the regions as a strength of Europe. Europe's strength lies in the diversity of its regions, where people feel at home. That is why we want to strengthen the Committee of the Regions. At the same time, our goal is to expand and promote greater regional cooperation across national borders - also by enabling cross- border pilot regions and further developing the European legal framework. For us, regionality also means ensuring that the provision of essential services, such as drinking water supply, remains in municipal hands.
3. Reorienting EU enlargement and neighborhood policy
Europe is bigger than the EU, but the EU is Europe's heart. Because the EU is constantly being challenged by new crises from outside, it is more important than ever for Europe to grow together. The accession of the six Western Balkan countries, Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova to the EU is in the security and geopolitical interests of Germany and Europe. Before accession, all accession criteria must be fully met.
EU accession candidates a concrete perspective. To this end, we propose intermediate stages for candidate countries towards EU membership. This can
z. For example, participation in individual EU programs, gradual access to the internal market or the granting of the four fundamental freedoms.
deepen cooperation with the United Kingdom. The British have recently opted for a path outside the EU. However, it is in our mutual strategic interest to work together closely and in a spirit of trust - also and especially in security policy. Cooperation must always serve the long-term European interest; this applies, for example, to the UK's rejoining the Erasmus+ program.
Utilizing the potential of the European Political Community. This format has created a new forum for exchange and cooperation between the EU countries and 17 other European states, which can strengthen cohesion throughout Europe. We reject duplicate structures with the EU.
Maintain good political and economic relations with Turkey. Turkey is also of strategic importance for Europe. We regret that it is currently moving away from the EU's values and is therefore unable to join the EU.
CDU and CSU as part of the European People's Party
As the CDU and CSU, we are part of the large Christian Democratic and Christian Socialist family in Europe: the European People's Party (EPP). It brings together around 50 parties from the member states of the European Union and dozens more from European countries outside the EU. Our ambition is to once again become the strongest political group in the European Parliament. Together we fight for our European way of life and our common convictions:
Our European way of life: stronger and safer together!
Europe is our home. As the EPP, we have built a Europe in which human dignity, freedom and security always come first. We, as Europeans, are more than the sum of our national identities. Our history, our heritage, our Judeo-Christian roots and our cultural diversity define us. "United in diversity" makes us strong together and enables peace and prosperity for
all Europeans. In the face of a complex world, some dream of being a "citizen of the world" without roots. Others want to close all doors and retreat into national egoism. We reject both. We are proud of our roots and optimistic about the future. We do not want to dictate to citizens what they should believe in or what they should fear.
Instead, we listen to them, respect them and stand up for them. We are bridge builders. The EPP invented our social market economy, which reconcileseconomic freedom with social responsibility. The EPP stands for a strong democracy based on the rule of law. In our Europe, the citizens decide.
We believe in our European way of life. Freedom is crucial, but there is no freedom without security. Our citizens expect a Europe in which they can live safely in all areas of life. They want secure jobs that guarantee a good life and enable a fulfilling family life. They expect a Europe that is committed to a life of freedom, justice and democracy.
We stand for a strong Europe that speaks with one voice on issues of democracy, the rule of law and freedom. A Europe that confidently opposes autocrats and stands by those who fight for our free basic order, as the Ukrainians are exemplarily doing every day against Putin's aggression. A Europe that protects its borders and fights illegal migration.
We stand for a competitive Europe that boosts its economy and creates quality jobs while enabling a good economic future for all. We stand for European leadership in environmental and climate protection, not only to protect our planet, but also to ensure economic prosperity and food security. We will further ensure this with less bureaucracy and a future-oriented energy union. We want Europe to shape and lead the future by investing in state-of-the-art infrastructure, innovation and digital technologies. At the same time, we stand for an open Europe that also protects its own interests. We want to give our citizens and our businesses access to global markets by concluding smart, reciprocal trade agreements with like-minded partners.
We stand for a Europe that is close to its citizens, supports families, creates opportunities for all and promotes equality between women and men and solidarity between the generations. A Europe that protects the most vulnerable in our society - online and offline. A Europe that ensures that people are at the center of every technological innovation. A Europe that turns "brain drain" into "brain gain". A Europe that invests in health research, guarantees high standards of health and care and fights disease.
We stand for a democratic Europe in which the citizens decide. A Europe that upholds its fundamental values within and beyond its borders. A Europe that guarantees that all citizens are equal before the law. A Europe that regains the trust of all those who feel unheard or left behind.
Europe has every opportunity to shape its own future in the best possible way. Just as the EPP has done over the past decades, we will now keep Europe together, defend our European way of life on the basis of freedom, pluralism, subsidiarity, solidarity, democracy and the rule of law, and promote sustainable economic growth and development. Only with the EPP will
Europe will be stronger and safer together.
Time for justice. Time for attitude. Time for peace.

INTRODUCTION
Dear voters,
Your vote is crucial in the upcoming European elections. Will we manage to emerge from the many crises, end the social imbalance and no longer leave decisions about our future to corporations and powerful interest groups? After all, many important decisions have long been made at European level. How can we make food and energy affordable? How can we restructure the economy in Europe in a socially just way? How can we stop the environmental and climate catastrophe, the mass deaths in the Mediterranean and the brutality at the EU's external borders? How to protect our democracy and create peace?
The Left is making a clear offer in this regard: We must regulate the market across borders and expand democracy. We are picking up on the anger of many people and exerting pressure for fundamental change. We want to finally hold the rich and corporations to account and make them pay in order to invest massively in a social, climate-friendly and environmentally compatible future - instead of leaving Europe to corporate lobbyists and the right.
The Left wants a Europe of social justice in which all people can live in dignity and free from poverty. A democratic EU in which human rights apply to all. An EU that is committed to peace. Our vision of a united Europe is one that is independent of the bloc confrontation between the USA and China and focuses on social security, climate justice, diplomacy and disarmament. A Europe of global justice that stops exploiting the Global South through free trade agreements and in the interests of corporations. An EU in which people and nature matter more than profit. We are asking for your support. We invite you to do so.
The last few years have shown that a strong left-wing voice in the European Parliament makes a difference. In the past legislative period, we have achieved a lot in the European Parliament: on our initiative, the European Parliament decided to release vaccination patents. We contributed to the introduction of a statutory minimum wage in Europe, which will lift millions of workers out of poverty or significantly reduce their poverty. We exerted decisive pressure in the European Parliament for the law to protect over 28 million workers on digital platforms. This shows that a strong left strengthens social security in Europe and expands what makes life and everyday life better.
The vision of a united Europe as an antithesis to fascism and war became strong after the Second World War. For many, the European Union embodies the hope of peace and freedom. At the same time, the EU was built to remove barriers to competition and profits, to create a common market and to strengthen capital. While governments and large companies have pushed for economic union, the development of a social union has lagged miles behind. Where the troika raged after the euro crisis, Europe is not a hope for peace and freedom, but the reason for social cuts and privatization. In the name of the common market, rules have been standardized, trade barriers dismantled, the movement of goods and commodities liberalized and the free movement of workers enforced - too often at the expense of hard-won social security and public infrastructure. An EU that dismantles social security at national level without creating it at European level will not have a majority in the long term.

Our fight for a socially and ecologically just, democratic and peaceful Europe moves between these hopes and interests, between these contradictions.
Despite all its shortcomings and misconstructions, there can be no going back on the political success of European integration, no going back to the nation state. We know that the fight for social guarantees, for climate justice, against energy poverty and against the power of transnational corporations can no longer be waged with any prospect of success at the national level alone. To be successful, we need cross-border cooperation. As democratic socialists, we therefore oppose both the proponents of a market-radical EU and the nationalist concept of a "Europe of fatherlands". Conscious of the constitution of the EU and the existing balance of power, we will not leave the European level of conflict to neoliberals and the right. Our idea of democratic socialism is international and therefore encompasses the struggle for a more democratic, more social European Union.
The EU urgently needs change. Large companies are often supported with tax money, while everyone else is expected to tighten their belts even more. Running, toiling, racing for the profits of banks and large corporations should be the way forward.
Instead of social security, we are supposed to be satisfied with either a slightly friendlier coat of paint, the mending of the previous path or the treading of the bottom.
Inequality in Europe is growing, the wealth of the few is constantly increasing - all the more reason for a strong left in the European Parliament to take action against these abuses. The Maastricht criteria prohibit borrowing for long-term public spending. As a result, there is a lack of public money in the EU for education, affordable housing, care and health, for functioning municipalities and for the eradication of poverty. One in four children in the EU lives in poverty.
Many healthcare systems in the EU have been brought to their knees by the coronavirus crisis. Nursing staff have worked far beyond their limits. But the profits of care and pharmaceutical companies have risen rapidly. Public schools and universities are dilapidated and there are far too few teachers. In many cities, there is a housing shortage for people on middle and low incomes. Rents are exploding, but housing corporations and investment funds are making huge profits. The rules to promote competitiveness and the internal market have driven the privatization of public property and public services. Services have become more expensive and worse.
Pensions are being speculated on the financial markets. Large digital corporations pay far too little tax. The market and the pursuit of profit determine areas of life that should first satisfy people's needs and requirements. We are a long way from equal living conditions within the EU and in this country. This will not get us through the crises. This is not the way to achieve the necessary socio-ecological transformation.
This is not the way to save democracy.
The EU is not only failing because of the social issue. It will crash through its self- imposed, far too low climate targets - meanwhile the climate catastrophe with forest fires, droughts and heavy rainfall is also escalating in Europe. The path of reducing CO2 emissions through higher prices and tax incentives will not stop the climate catastrophe. "The market will sort it out" is the credo. But the market prefers to make a profit! Those in power in the EU declare that they want a climate-neutral economy. But they shy away from conflict with the corporations that exploit fossil fuels and do not want to break with an economic policy that puts the interests of the rich and corporations first. Their focus on "strengthening the
|7
For people and the environment, "competitiveness" and competition between locations means inequality, poverty and destruction. Ecosystems are collapsing and natural resources are being plundered. The EU Commission's "Green Deal" does nothing to change this. The greatest overexploitation is caused by corporations and the rich. Their profit logic has put us all in a situation where "business as usual" is impossible.
Is everyone responsible for this? No! In its latest report, the Club of Rome points out that the richest people consume the most resources without bearing the necessary consequences. He is right. The wealth generated by ruthless environmental destruction must not remain private, but must be used for social tasks as part of a responsible policy. We need to adapt to the new environmental conditions, energy transition and heat transition. We need an economic policy suitable for grandchildren.
We want to put an end to lobbying and corruption. Strengthening democracy and cohesion - that can't be done with words. This is only possible if the interests of the rich and corporations are restricted instead of pitting those with little money against those with even less. We want guidelines that corporations must adhere to. We want renewable energies and a sustainable economy to be massively promoted: with public money, which then leads to public ownership or public shareholdings. Employees and trade unions must be able to play a significant role in shaping the transformation, which requires more co-determination rights, employment guarantees and the strengthening of collective bargaining. A publicly owned energy supply system must offer affordable and socially staggered prices. We are fighting for an investment offensive that will make Europe fit for the future, improve everyday life for people in structurally weak and disadvantaged regions in East and West, restructure industry and strengthen our municipalities: more and reliable bus and rail transport, free public transport, renewable energies, a strong regional economy with good wages and shorter transport routes. This is how we create social security in times of change - and millions of well-paid industrial jobs with a future!
The social and climate-friendly restructuring of the economy and society is an epochal challenge. It requires more cross-border cooperation and international exchange.
However, the EU is drifting apart both politically and socially. The USA, the EU and China are increasingly competing with each other. The global power blocs are shifting. The world has become more confusing and dangerous, and the bloc confrontation between the USA and China and Russia is coming to a head. New trade wars and a gigantic arms race are the result. In alliance with the USA and NATO, the EU has been arming itself for years and supplying weapons to dictatorships. In times of a reorganization of the global balance of power, the EU could become an anchor of stability: For a fair world trade order, for international law and human rights, for the diplomatic settlement of conflicts, for the rule of law and for an ecological economy. As an independent actor, it must therefore under no circumstances join the chorus of imperial states such as the USA or Russia. Turning back globalization by dividing the world into zones of influence and trade instead of finally shaping it fairly exacerbates bloc confrontation, trade conflicts and armament. We are fighting for a radical transformation of the EU so that it can play its part in solving humanity's problems.
Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, continues. It is a crime. Millions of people are on the run, the death toll continues to rise, homes and infrastructure are being destroyed. The war must end immediately and Russian troops must be withdrawn from Ukraine. To this end, the European Union should step up its diplomatic efforts instead of
8|
Fueling the war of attrition. The EU must consistently enforce sanctions against the Russian power apparatus, the oligarchs and the military-industrial complex. Together with Brazil, India and China, it can build up diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire and a peaceful solution. The cornerstones for this must be: withdrawal of Russian troops, restoration of Ukraine's territorial sovereignty, security guarantees and minority rights. Civilian alternatives to military tunnel vision and more and more weapons are urgently needed.
Numerous wars are raging around the world in which - as in Ethiopia or Yemen - hundreds of thousands of people are being killed, often with European weapons and Western support. In some cases, NATO partners such as Turkey are breaking international law. Vladimir Putin's brutal attack on Ukraine also serves as an opportunity to massively increase arms spending in EU countries. In Germany too. The Bundeswehr alone is receiving 100 billion euros in special funds - despite the nursing care crisis and lack of education, housing shortages and missed climate targets. This does not create more security: the arms expenditure of the EU states has long been many times that of Russia. The profits of arms companies are going through the roof and shareholders are enjoying high dividends. Instead of wasting more and more money on arms companies, we need massive investment in the future and the climate-friendly restructuring of the economy and society - this will create energy independence and sustainable security.
The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have shown how vulnerable global capitalism and the production and supply chains that extend across many countries are. Energy prices have been driven up during the crisis. The regulation of the European electricity market is misguided and has exacerbated the situation. The profits of energy companies are exploding. Prices, especially for food, are bringing people all over Europe to the brink of existential crisis. In view of the high inflation, companies are talking about a wage-price spiral, but it is actually a profit-price spiral. Wages are systematically lagging behind inflation. The profits of large companies and digital corporations such as Amazon are rising massively throughout Europe. Corporations and the super-rich are becoming richer and more powerful, not least because their lobbyists are helping to write European laws.
The result of this crisis capitalism: uncertainty is growing throughout Europe. In many countries, we are witnessing the rise of the far right, which is denigrating democracy and engaging in inhuman agitation. In the EU, too, democracy is already under pressure in many cases, with right-wing parties in government in many member states and tearing down the foundations of democracy. Even so-called centrist parties are increasingly subordinating human rights and democracy to authoritarian measures and sacrificing them to short-term economic interests. They are moving ever closer to the right. We are taking a clear stand against the right and the grand coalition of isolationism. We are the only political group in the European Parliament to oppose attacks on the right of asylum without compromise.
The EU shares responsibility for widespread poverty, increasing hunger and a lack of prospects in many regions, particularly in the Global South. It is disgraceful how the EU, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, treats people who risk their lives to flee. Human rights and humanity are indivisible. In view of the increasing militarization of the EU's external borders and a discourse that is drifting to the right, we stand up for the fundamental values of international solidarity, humanity and human rights. We demand: No deals with dictators!
Defend human rights and fight the causes of flight - not refugees.
Democracy is not just a matter of professions and fine words. For us, democracy means more equality: in terms of wealth and living conditions in Europe
|9
and in Germany, in the decisions that affect the lives of everyone. Our democracy is under threat from the super-rich, corporations and lobby groups that evade democratic rules. It is under attack from right-wing parties: Where they are strong, fundamental rights such as those of women are at risk. Democracy is endangered by policies that roll out the red carpet for the rich and the right. We stand in the way of the enemies of democracy everywhere and fight for equal rights for all people. No one should be disadvantaged because of their gender, sexual orientation or identity. Public services and social provision must no longer be destroyed by the pursuit of profit, speculation and the market. They are the foundations of democracy.
We know that: It is not true that there is no money for social policy and investment. Cuts and the "debt brake" are political (mis)decisions that can be changed. Money can be collected from the super-rich and corporations. Because the exploding wealth of the few is based on the exploitation of the many. We want to reclaim the wealth and use it to fight poverty in Europe, to create good jobs with the energy transition, to improve living conditions for everyone instead of having Europe's low-wage and poverty zones facing tax havens. We are fighting for the primacy of politics over the economy! A community that wants to preserve democratic sovereignty must tax wealth in such a way that it does not become a problem for democracy. A community that wants to defend its democracy cannot allow its future to be ruined by financial speculation.
Where there is a will, there are special assets!
Time is pressing. Corporations, conservatives and liberals are preparing for the "Agenda 2030" is already preparing the next attack on social rights, employees and the welfare state. This shows that If you want Europe, you have to take it away from the rich and corporations and give public ownership priority over privatization, speculation and market faith. Our economy needs a strong public backbone and massive investment so that we can overcome the numerous crises. We want the EU to work for the people. That is why we want to change the EU.
The neoliberal policy of cuts is still inscribed in its institutions: through the Fiscal Pact, the Maastricht criteria and the investment brake trivialized as a "debt brake". It doesn't have to stay that way.
We need the courage to regulate the market and break the power of the corporations. Then a different, fair and hopeful Europe is possible.
We stand up for this everywhere - on the streets, in parliaments, in companies, in neighborhoods. We are not alone in this. The protests in France against the unsocial pension reform, the trade union struggles in Germany, initiatives for better healthcare in Spain or the struggles of the feminist movement for the right to abortion in Poland and the struggles for the coal phase-out all over Europe show this: Courage is also growing. We want to build on this: with our partners in the Party of the European Left (European LEFT), our parliamentary group (THE LEFT) and other European allies.
Together with trade unions and social movements. Together with the many people who are active for affordable housing and climate justice, against power cuts, for nature conservation, for good wages and working conditions in the health sector. Many oppose free trade agreements, demand safe escape routes and provide for refugees.
They are preventing the privatization of water or producing green electricity cooperatively. They take to the streets for peace and in
10|
ternational solidarity. The people who are active in social movements and often live solidarity and democracy in their neighborhoods - they are ambassadors for a different Europe, a just European Union.
Positive changes are possible. The disputes over the reform of the fiscal pact and the implementation of the results of the EU Conference on the Future could be an opportunity. The inclusion of common bonds, the easing of state aid rules, the extension of the deadlines for debt reduction and the creation of investment funds show that this is possible: Neoliberalism in the EU is under massive pressure. At last. But it will not fall by itself. We must and we can overcome it. The upcoming elections are therefore about nothing less than the future of the EU - and therefore of us all.
We are standing up against a Europe of the rich, the right and lobbyists - and for a Europe in the interests of the employed and unemployed, all those on low and middle incomes. These are our people. We make policy for them.
We want a European turnaround for justice. That is why we want the EU to become a force for social justice, environmental protection, international understanding and peace. An independent Europe that is committed to people, not profit.
We are not for sale and are the only party in the Bundestag that does not accept donations from companies and corporations. Together with many, we have initiated important improvements. With your support, we can strengthen social justice in the EU. In the midst of all the crises, the European elections are therefore also an opportunity. For this we need your vote.

Chapter 1: Redistribution for social justice
Inequality in the EU has grown and the gap between rich and poor continues to widen. The promise that the European Union would bring Europe closer together has not been kept. The EU's treaty principles put the unhindered movement of capital and goods before the social interests of the population. This creates more and more inequality between the owners of large companies and employees, pensioners and their families. Inequality is the opposite of social justice. It excludes millions of people from fair participation in society. The injustice can be felt in everyday life: working to exhaustion in care, at the checkout and still barely making ends meet, higher energy costs - but corporations are enjoying record profits. Inequality undermines democracy and destroys social cohesion in the EU. The EU is committed to equal living conditions.
However, inequality between regions is growing. Inequality means unequal wages for the same work in different places in the EU; women still get less for the same work. If you are rich, you pollute the environment many times over. Poor people fall ill more often and die earlier. Those who are rich can hide from taxes more easily and have a better chance of lobbying their own interests in parliament.
If you want Europe, you have to take it from the rich. The left fights for a redistribution of social wealth so that there is enough for a good life for all.
? We want to shift wealth from profits to wages: Corporate profits in Europe have gone through the roof, wages and salaries are being eaten up by price increases. Inflation is being driven by corporate profits. Companies are investing less and less of their profits in innovation and shifting more and more to dividends. They want innovations to be financed by government investment without having to use their own profits and cooperate in any way.
? We want to p u t employees at the center of economic decisions. The management of investments, modernization and general working conditions must be determined by the employees themselves. They create the wealth of the company through their work - not the management.
? We want to shift private wealth to the public sector: High net worth and corporate profits must contribute more to the financing of public services throughout the EU. For social security and reliable public services and structures, for investments in the climate-friendly and social restructuring of our economy. This is also a contribution to equal living conditions in the EU.
? We want to redirect wealth from the top to the bottom: we want to enforce minimum social standards and abolish poverty in Europe.
We are committed to good social benefits and to ensuring that people are not dependent on social benefits: because wages and pensions are sufficient for a good life; because public services are free of charge; because housing is affordable; because energy costs are socially staggered. Social participation and protection against poverty are not just a question of social policy. They rely on strong trade unions that fight for good wages. Loyalty to collective bargaining and the right to strike are central to this. Good wages must lead to pensions that enable people to maintain their standard of living and protect them from poverty. Participation is based on a socially just economic policy and the allocation of public funds: If the
12|
Wealth in the regions where production takes place? Do the big companies pay taxes where they generate turnover?
Does public funding also result in public ownership? Are public ownership shares used to influence the type of economic activity and social prices? We want to shift the balance: Services of general interest must work for the common good, not for profit. For a greater say for employees in all companies and sectors that receive state funding and investment!
Redistribution for good work
We are fighting for good wages throughout Europe that everyone can live well on. Companies must not relocate their operations or their headquarters in order to engage in wage and social dumping or change their legal form in order to undermine employees' co-determination rights. We want good standards for everyone in a democratic Europe. We want people to be able to move freely in Europe - but they should not have to emigrate because there is no work in their country of origin or only under poor conditions. We do not accept that they are misused as cheap labor when they come to work in Germany or other countries. We have fought for a minimum wage directive in the European Parliament. Now we are fighting to ensure that it is properly implemented in Germany.
Wages are high!
At least 20 million people in the EU are at risk of poverty despite having a job. With the Minimum Wage Directive, the EU obliges the member states to enact laws for an appropriate level of statutory minimum wages and their regular adjustment by the end of 2024. According to the EU, an appropriate minimum wage is at least 60 percent of the mean (= median) hourly wage. In Germany, this would be 14.12 euros in 2024! The EU calls for national action plans to increase collective bargaining coverage if less than 80 percent of employees are covered by collective agreements. In G e r m a n y , this figure is only around 50 percent - every second employee in this country is not protected by a collective agreement. With collective agreements, employees earn more and are better protected. We want to ensure that collective bargaining coverage increases!
? The statutory minimum wage in Germany must rise to at least 15 euros and be automatically increased annually in line with the inflation rate.
? Public money only for good work. To ensure that public contracts are no longer awarded to wage squeezers and companies without a collective agreement, compliance with collective bargaining agreements must be made a nationwide requirement for public contracts, including for subcontractors.
? We want collective agreements to be generally binding: Collective bargaining coverage in Germany is also so low because it is easy for companies to evade collective agreements. Collective agreements must become generally binding at the request of the trade unions.
? Collective agreements must continue to apply when outsourcing to subcontractors.
? We want to regulate contracts for work and temporary work more strictly in order to prevent wage dumping and insecure working conditions.
? We want to ban memberships without a collective agreement (OT) in employers' associations.
? We want to include the obligation to respect collective agreements in EU public procurement law.
|13
? We know that 60% of the median wage is not enough to cover living costs in all EU countries. That is why we are committed to ensuring that the minimum wage in all EU countries is also based on actual living requirements (living wage).
? We are committed to ensuring that unsafe working conditions with subcontractors and temporary work are banned in the EU.
Shorter working hours: Time for leisure and family
Business associations in many European countries are pushing for longer working hours for employees. They want 12-hour days and 60-hour weeks and are mobilizing against protective laws that stand in the way. They are trying to sell this as a gain in freedom. But freedom means that we can decide for ourselves how and for what we spend our time - and not management according to its profit interests. That is why we are fighting for shorter working hours so that we have more time for family, friends, hobbies and relaxation. Article 2 of the European Social Charter also stipulates the obligation to "progressively shorten the working week". In many professions, employees are already at the limits of their strength. This particularly affects care workers, educators and employees in social institutions. Many therefore work part- time, even if this means less money and a low pension for them - and exacerbates the shortage of skilled workers. Shorter working hours and higher wages will make care, education and other "shortage occupations" more attractive. In this way, sufficient skilled workers can be found and retained. Shorter working hours facilitate an equal division of labor in household and care tasks, which have so far mainly been performed by women.
? A 4-day week is enough: short full-time working hours for all with full pay and the necessary staff compensation. We propose a reduction to around 30 hours per week (or a 4-day week): to be chosen flexibly over the professional biography. We want to promote model projects for this. A reduction in working hours must not lead to an intensification of work!
? Germany must finally implement mandatory working time recording for all employees in line with the ruling of the European Court of Justice. Employees are cheated out of part of their wages due to unrecorded working hours and unrealistic performance targets.
? Waiting times during work must be paid. They are not free time for employees!
? We need EU occupational health and safety directives to protect against stress and physical overload to ensure good standards throughout the EU.
Equal pay for work of equal value
Women in Germany are still paid almost a fifth less than men for their work. This is one of the highest pay gaps of all EU countries. With the Pay Transparency Directive, the EU obliges member states to take measures to change this by 2026. We don't just want transparency, we want equality: the German Pay Transparency Act must be an equal pay law. We not only need a right to information, but also stronger enforcement rights in order to actually achieve equal pay. In addition, wages in so-called women's occupations must rise - to this end, outsourcing by public employers must be ended and public services must be adequately funded. (See Chapter 1, "Taxes against inequality and for a good future")
14|
? All companies must provide their employees with information on wage levels for comparable jobs.
? We want a right of action for associations to enforce equal pay so that women no longer have to sue for their rights alone.
Protecting employees in the digitalization process
The digitalization of production processes, the use of computer systems and artificial intelligence applications are giving new urgency to the protection of employees. Digital processes leave behind data that allows comprehensive conclusions to be drawn about the workers. Performance and behavior can thus be monitored and controlled. We want to protect the personal rights of employees, prevent unauthorized controls and limit behavioral control. This is the only way we can maintain and develop a humane working environment in which digital applications are a support for employees and not just a means for companies to increase their profits. Digitalization should make life and work easier, not make it more difficult or be used to undermine labour rights.
? Data protection for employees must be comprehensively regulated. The EU has expressly made this possible in the General Data Protection Regulation!
? We want to ban the use of keyloggers and other surveillance technologies.
? Digital surveillance of works councils must be ruled out.
? Works councils and employees must be given the right to information on where artificial intelligence (AI) is used. It must be made transparent which algorithms are being used so that works councils can review their working methods and decision- making processes.
? No personnel selection by AI! It leads to discrimination because different experiences are given less consideration.
? We want the EU to regulate the use of AI in the world of work across Europe. Particularly in the digital sector, working conditions do not stop at borders.
28 million people in Europe work for digital platforms such as Uber, Lieferando or Amazon, often under precarious conditions. By 2025, this figure is likely to rise to 43 million. They are often bogus self-employed and receive their orders via non- transparent algorithms. With the Platform Work Directive, the EU wants to ensure employee rights and social protection for these workers. The business associations are trying to deny these rights to as many employees as possible. We want the directive to be fully implemented for all employees so that minimum wages, working time regulations, social security protection, employee participation rights and the right to unionize are not undermined or circumvented.
? The terms "company" and "employee" must be adapted to the reality of capitalist platform work. Platform workers are entitled to the same labor rights, social security protection and co-determination rights as workers in conventional companies.
? A right to information about the awarding of contracts by algorithms must be created. Works councils need the right to inspect the algorithms.
|15
Protecting the solo self-employed
The European Commission has adopted guidelines that enable collective bargaining for solo self-employed workers by exempting them from competition law. We welcome this, but we also need a European regulation to improve working conditions for solo self-employed workers.
? Clients must also pay social security contributions for solo self-employed persons.
? Industry-wide minimum fees must be regulated.
Restrict outsourcing to subcontractors
The outsourcing of contracts to legally independent subcontractors is increasing. Companies - and also public employers! - to circumvent labor and wage standards in the main company. Such social dumping is particularly common in the construction industry, logistics, the IT sector, the travel industry, public transport and agriculture.
? We want a European regulation on general contractor liability, as exists in the construction industry in Germany, for example. Clients must be liable for the working conditions and remuneration of the subcontractors they commission.
? If the EU treaties are amended, the areas of public services must be excluded from liberalization and privatization.
Making companies responsible for the entire supply chain
The EU wants to establish due diligence obligations for companies with their foreign suppliers. It is not a law of nature that companies source preliminary products from subcontractors in other countries whose working and manufacturing conditions they cannot control. This is a corporate strategy to reduce the costs of manufacturing and storing their products. Social and environmental dumping and the violation of labor and human rights are usually accepted. It is not true that entrepreneurs do not know and cannot influence the conditions under which their low-cost suppliers produce. We are committed to ensuring that all manufacturers are held accountable.
? The thresholds for company sizes must be significantly reduced.
? We want to extend the information and co-determination rights of works councils. (See Chapter 4, "Socially just worldwide")
More rights for mobile and seasonal workers
Labor mobility within the EU must not lead to workers being exploited and social security being undermined. Even today
"Letterbox companies" are used to organize a dumping competition with mobile workers for the lowest wages and worst working conditions. This undermining of labor standards must be stopped. The EU wants to strengthen the social protection of workers posted abroad by revising the Posting of Workers Directive. The following must apply:
? Full social security protection in every employment relationship from the first day, including for seasonal workers. "Marginal employment" must no longer be misused for social dumping!
16|
? Social security contributions must be paid where the value creation takes place in order to prevent abusive posting.
? Unemployment insurance claims must be offset across borders.
? Placement agencies must comply with minimum standards and provide good working conditions.
? We are fighting for binding, humane standards for accommodation for mobile workers.
? Occupational health and safety controls in the member states must be expanded in the interests of employees: Customs must stop creating success by detecting "illegal residence" in cases of doubt instead of taking action against companies. This is particularly important for foreign employees and to strengthen occupational health and safety.
? The EU must provide permanent and adequate funding for Europe-wide advice centers for mobile workers, such as the DGB's Fair Mobility Network.
Strengthening co-determination and democracy in companies and the economy
Companies like to see democracy end at the factory gate. The European single market makes it easier to play employees off against each other and to threaten to relocate to countries with lower wages or social standards (and to carry out the threat). They change the legal form of their companies in order to circumvent employee co- determination of company policy in the supervisory boards. However, the EU's Transformation Directive allows a much stronger limitation than the German government has implemented. We are committed to strengthening the rights of employees and works councils and oppose the erosion of democracy by companies.
This is of crucial importance for a socio-ecological restructuring of the economy.
? We demand a right of co-determination on economic issues such as investments, plant closures, relocations and redundancies. Employees and society must have a say in what is produced, where and under what conditions. This must not be left solely to the profit interests of shareholders.
? German co-determination laws must be extended to foreign company forms and also apply in full to the European Company (SE) in order to prevent co- determination flight. We want to strengthen European works councils.
? The right to strike must be guaranteed for all employees in Germany, including employees in church institutions and civil servants. We want to establish a right to political strike action at European level.
? Where public funds flow to companies, they must be combined with an extension of employee co-determination rights or public co-ownership.
? In the event of relocation, public subsidies for the relocation must be repaid. The period for which this applies must be extended.
? We want to promote cooperatives and collective ownership of companies.

Social security for all in Europe: redistribution from top to bottom
Abolishing poverty and combating social exclusion
We are declaring war on inequality: The outrageous wealth of the few is the poverty of the many. We want to put an end to this. We want to strengthen the welfare state everywhere in Europe and make companies more responsible for financing social security systems.
More than one in five people in the European Union are at risk of poverty, that is over 140 million people. This includes one in four children under the age of 18. Inequality between regions has increased. The EU's "social pillar" was intended to counterbalance neoliberal policies and their consequences. But more than 100 million people work in the low-wage sector, in precarious employment and are poor despite and with work.
We oppose impoverishment and de- security with our vision of a socially just EU in which all people can live with social security, good work, adequate pensions and a poverty-proof livelihood. Social security is a prerequisite for a dignified life. If corporations and the rich are made responsible, it can be financed.
? European minimum standards: Social standards in EU countries must only be harmonized upwards, not lowered (upward convergence). Instead of institutionalizing cuts (as with the Maastricht criteria and the fiscal pact), we call for an automatic social protection mechanism for the EU. If wages and incomes, employment and social spending fall below a threshold, appropriate countermeasures must be introduced.
? We want a European minimum income: It should secure the socio-cultural minimum subsistence level if sufficient financial resources are not available. This minimum income must provide secure protection against poverty in all circumstances. In March 2023, the European Parliament adopted a binding directive at our request; now it must be implemented!
? We want to implement a European unemployment insurance scheme. To this end, a framework directive is to be created that sets guidelines for the member states. It must set minimum standards for entitlements, the level and duration of entitlement and the coverage rate (i.e. how many unemployed people receive benefits from unemployment insurance).
? If social rights enshrined in the European Social Charter are violated, we want to create a collective right of appeal (right of association). This is provided for in the "EU Protocol on an optional collective complaints procedure" of 1995. Germany has neither signed nor ratified this protocol to date.
? Institutionalize social progress: We call for a social progress clause to ensure the fundamental primacy of basic social rights, in particular the right to strike (regardless of the sector), over the freedom of the internal market.
Secure pensions!
We are fighting for old age in social security everywhere in Europe. One in five pensioners in the EU is at risk of poverty. Pensions must not be speculated on the financial markets and pension benefits must not be dependent on share prices.
Companies want to raise the retirement age. We stand up
18|
against this! The price increases have caused hardship for many pensioners. We are fighting for effective compensation for pension inflation!
? We want a Europe-wide minimum pension that guarantees that all people in old age are safe from poverty. It must be above the poverty risk threshold of the respective country. It should be income and wealth-tested.
? The statutory pension must secure the standard of living achieved in working life throughout Europe. We also call for low pensions to be topped up until they provide secure protection against poverty (solidary minimum pension).
? European pension funds are among the largest investors in fossil fuels worldwide. The expansion of funded pension systems has turned them into yield-driven investors who not only harm the environment, but also take risks. We want to reduce the power of pension funds by strengthening statutory and pay-as-you-go pension funds across Europe.
Fighting child poverty across Europe, strengthening children's rights
In the EU, almost one in four children under the age of 18 lived in poverty in 2019 (22%). That's almost 18 million children in need. In Germany, too, one in five children is affected by poverty. The European Child Guarantee aims to combat child poverty and the social exclusion of children in the EU.
? We want the European Child Guarantee to be implemented in such a way that all children and young people have socio-cultural participation and equal and non- discriminatory access to free education and upbringing, healthcare, healthy nutrition and age-appropriate accommodation.
? Children and young people must be involved in the implementation so that their perspectives are taken into account.
? The introduction of a basic child guarantee must be a central component of the European Child Guarantee.
For a strong European community: Redistribution from private to public
We want an EU that stands for social progress. One that strengthens the bargaining power of employees with a policy of full employment and is able to meet the financial challenges of the socially and ecologically just restructuring of the economy. The EU budget and the national budgets must meet these requirements. The problems of neoliberalism are becoming apparent. The EU is increasingly being forced to break with the neoliberal principles on which its own treaties are based. We are fighting for a strong, independent EU that organizes the social and ecological restructuring of the economy and society. The EU budget must reflect this.
To overcome the corona crisis, the EU has adopted the "NextGenerationEU" program together with its multiannual financial framework 2021 to 2027. For the first time, the EU has taken out its own loans, known as Eurobonds, on the financial markets at favorable conditions. However, this is not enough to tackle the existing crises in the EU.
The Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact stipulate that countries may not incur annual debt of more than 3% of their gross domestic product and that their overall debt level may not exceed 60%. The fiscal pact even tightens the new debt ratio for euro countries to a maximum of 0.5 percent. These rules prevent the EU from pursuing an active fiscal policy. They lay down
|19
The EU and its member states are committed to a neoliberal policy that prioritizes increasing corporate profits. The EU can only find broad and lasting social acceptance if it no longer follows neoliberal dogma and is not associated with personal deprivations decided "by Brussels".
The European fiscal rules - like the German debt brake - have prevented sensible and necessary public investment. They were suspended in the course of the coronavirus crisis because they failed in the face of reality. The EU Commission and the member states are currently negotiating their tentative reform. However, the 3 percent deficit criterion and the 60 percent debt-to-GDP ratio remain in place. The member states are merely to have more flexibility in reducing debt. The 3 percent deficit limit and the 60 percent ceiling are arbitrary and there is no economic justification for them. We demand that they be lifted and the European treaties amended accordingly to enable effective social policy and long-term socio-ecological investments!
The first step can be taken without changing the treaties: We want net public investment to be financed through loans. Public investment strengthens and improves public infrastructure and public assets and creates sustainable economic development. Public investments may therefore not be included in deficits and debt levels.
Investments in armaments and military expenditure are excluded from this, as they do not contribute to increasing social welfare.
? The EU budget must be twice as large in order to overcome the numerous crises in the EU and enable balanced regional development.
? Where does the money come from: We want to introduce new taxes for transnational and multinational corporations. A financial transaction tax and overall taxation of corporations at EU level through direct taxation of 25 percent of corporate profits will help to harmonize taxes in the EU.
? We want to use EU structural funds specifically for socio-ecological restructuring (European Green New Deal) in order to support people and regions in converting: Conversion of the economy and transport, energy and agriculture.
? We do not want to spend money on Frontex, Pesco and similar arms programs. Instead, money is needed to strengthen civil conflict resolution - including knowledge and research.
? Too little is still being spent on achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and on gender equality, and we want to change that.
? Funds from the EU budget must not be tied to social cuts or the restriction of social and labor rights in the member states. This is detrimental to social and economic development.
? We want to reform the EU: It must be able to take on its own debt for which it is liable.
? We want the neoliberal Maastricht criteria, the Stability and Growth Pact and the Fiscal Compact to be fundamentally revised and the treaties amended. Cosmetic corrections are not enough!
? The European Central Bank should be allowed to finance the EU budget.
20|
? The EU budget and the democratization of the EU belong together: The European Parliament has so far had no independent control over the EU budget. We want to change that!
More public wealth: right of way for the public sector
Public services of general interest include education, mobility, energy, care, health, housing, water, waste and much more. In all these areas, we want to establish a cost- effective and ecologically fair supply. In the EU, public services have been at the mercy of the market for decades and have been cut to the bone. The obligation to invite tenders throughout Europe and the restrictions o n publicly owned companies have damaged the quality of public services. Numerous municipal companies have been privatized. The focus on non-competition and austerity has left deep scars throughout t h e EU: There is a shortage of teachers in schools and a lack of money to refurbish buildings. Hospitals are facing a nursing crisis and a shortage of beds, and not just during the coronavirus crisis.
Energy companies are making billions in profits, while the majority are s u f f e r i n g from high energy prices. More and more people know that privatization does not lead to lower prices and better services - on the contrary.
The provision of services of general interest is a class issue: those who can afford it send their children to private schools. If you can buy a condominium in a big city, you don't need public housing. If you drive a luxury car, you don't need public transport. If you have a swimming pool, you don't need public swimming pools. Good public services are the glue that holds society together. They are crucial for people's quality of life. EU treaties and directives must no longer push for profit and privatization! The Left fights for rich public services with good services and working conditions instead of private wealth and public scarcity. Strengthening public services of general interest means creating public wealth. We are t a k i n g back public services of general interest and creating the conditions for a good life for all.
Our vision of public services includes:
? Public transport is well developed and free of charge throughout the EU. (See chapter 3,
"More mobility with less traffic")
? Everyone has access to locally produced, non-profit and affordable energy supply through municipal utilities and energy cooperatives with socially staggered prices. (See Chapter 3, "Socially just energy transition instead of energy market")
? Affordable housing for all! More public housing and more public benefit on the housing market - our goal is at least half in public hands! (See Chapter 1, "Right to housing, climate-friendly and affordable for all")
? Instead of big profits for hospital and care corporations, we want an organization and financing of the healthcare system that covers the costs: hospitals and care homes back in public hands! (See Chapter 1, "Good health and care")
? Municipal care centers: Accessible social services such as health advice, educational advice and administrative assistance are created here. The care centers also provide spaces for exchange, communication and self-organization. In this way, they strengthen solidarity in the neighborhoods.
|21
? Create social centers! We propose that vacant commercial premises be transferred to communal or cooperative ownership and used as social centers. These places should serve as meeting places and offer basic services such as a post office and bank. They can provide spaces for civic initiatives, communal coffee mornings, discussion groups, cultural events, advice and much more. We want to promote models in which several generations live together. Village stores with access to ordering platforms for regional producers are also possible.
? Welcome needs structures: Refugees arrive in the municipalities - we support them in creating a welcoming culture and providing for the refugees. We are calling for an EU-wide fund that ensures freedom of movement for refugees and helps welcoming municipalities and cities that show solidarity. (See Chapter 5, "Welcome needs structures")
? Public water dispensers like in Rome, sun cream dispensers like in Holland and free public toilets everywhere: We want local authorities to be able to provide more than what is absolutely necessary.
We say how we want to pay for this: with appropriate taxes on high assets and corporate profits and with a strong, fair EU budget.
The money is there: let's get the wealth back!
The EU has been working towards dissolving public ownership and introducing the market We want to strengthen public ownership and the orientation towards the common good in services of general interest. Public ownership must also mean socially acceptable prices and economic activity oriented towards the common good.
? We want a municipalization fund at EU level from cohesion policy resources. It should provide financial support to municipalities that want to (re)transfer their privatized companies into public ownership, be it housing stock, hospitals, water supply, local public transport or waste management.
Models with different forms of ownership must be promoted: Ownership by municipalities, by employees or by citizens - from the classic public utility to municipal utilities and cooperatives. A common condition for funding is a non-profit orientation: surpluses and profits may not be withdrawn, but must be reinvested. In the case of municipal sponsorship, a transfer to the public budget of the municipality is possible.
For strong municipalities
Public services of general interest must be guaranteed locally and regionally. Many public services of general interest are provided by local authorities. They are obliged to put services out to tender across Europe. European subsidies are tied to additional funding for local authorities - which is often lacking because local authorities receive too little tax revenue from companies and the wealthy and receive too little support from the federal government for the costs of social services. The result: the cheapest offer is often accepted or the services are privatized or discontinued altogether. We want to tie contract awards to social, collective bargaining and ecological criteria and give priority to short distances and regional services. Many local authorities want to transfer their outsourced businesses and services back into their own ownership. The Left supports them in this process with the municipalization fund.
Our vision of public services of general interest requires that municipalities have the scope to meet the needs of citizens in a way that is geared towards the common good. The
22|
Local authorities are subject to the corset of the EU internal market in their economic activities - we want to change that: Hospitals, museums or energy suppliers should not be seen as companies that have to compete with each other for the highest profits.
? Public services of general interest without the compulsion to maximize profits should not be the exception, but the desirable rule. Municipalities as providers of public services of general interest must not be hindered in their function of providing goods for the common good. The treaties and directives of the EU, especially in procurement and state aid law, must be amended accordingly.
? The direct award of public services to municipal bodies should not only continue to be possible, but should once again be the norm. Attacks on direct awards by corporations must be fended off. The ban on privatization that was fought for in the area of water by the European citizens' initiative "Right2Water" is a good step that should also be applied in other areas.
? We reject the current EU-wide tendering obligation for municipal services. When awarding contracts to public or private bodies, high social (collective bargaining obligation) and ecological criteria are needed. To this end, we are calling for a further relaxation of state aid regulations and an end to or at least exemptions from the European debt brake: municipalities and federal states need financial leeway to organize socially and ecologically just public services of general interest.
? EU law now allows member states, federal states and local authorities to set their own criteria for awarding contracts. We want ecologically compatible and, where possible, regional economic activity with collective bargaining agreements to become a legal requirement for awarding contracts in the EU as a rule.
? Many municipalities in the European Union and in Germany are chronically underfunded. Municipal revenues must therefore be strengthened and stabilized. The crisis in municipal financing becomes apparent when municipalities are unable to access funding because they have too few staff in the areas relevant to planning (e.g. building authorities) to apply for it.
? To date, EU funding has been tied to co-financing from local authorities. This means that municipalities with financial problems - which are particularly reliant on funding - can apply for less funding than financially strong municipalities. We want to reverse this: Municipalities in crisis and with budget security should be able to submit applications with priority.
Right to housing, climate-friendly and affordable for all!
We are campaigning for the right to housing: affordable, climate-friendly and dignified. The EU has not yet contributed anything to the right to housing - this must change. With the support of The Left, the European Parliament has passed a resolution that everyone has the right to affordable housing. The right must become binding and go further: In order to enforce the right to housing, social control over the housing sector is needed. It must not be left to the interests of real estate groups or the uncontrolled growth of Airbnb. Together with the European tenant movements, we are fighting for rent caps and consistent tenant protection, for European funding for non-profit housing construction and against homelessness.
|23
Our home, not your profits
We want to put an end to the financialized housing industry. Real estate funds are currently being provided with EU subsidies: Vono- via, for example, received 600 million euros from the European Investment Bank for energy-efficient refurbishments without transparent conditions. No state subsidies for profit-oriented housing groups without clear social conditions and transparency!
? The funding policy of the EU and its member states must be geared towards realizing the right to climate-friendly, affordable housing.
? Tax advantages for real estate investors and companies, such as share deals, must be abolished across the board.
? Pension and other funds as well as large institutional investors are investing billions in housing and speculating on high returns. This further fuels the spiraling rents. We want a ban on funds investing in housing and housing companies. No profits from rent!
? We support initiatives to socialize large real estate groups: In Germany, we are transferring housing into public law institutions, while other countries have different legal bases for this. The EU must not prevent the expropriation of housing groups.
? We want to take the ground away from Airbnb and co. Everywhere in Europe, living space is being misused for vacation accommodation. We want to prevent this. We want to create a fair alternative ("Fairbnb") for non-commercial home sharing from private to private. We want to prohibit the misappropriation of entire apartments or houses. This will secure living space where it is particularly scarce: in cities and regions where there is high demand.
? Against real estate and land price speculation: Vacancies and speculative properties must be made available for renting, as is the case in Spain.
Strengthen non-profit housing!
We want to strengthen investment in social and non-profit housing across Europe. Non- profit housing is created locally on a decentralized basis: Municipalities, cooperatives and self-managed housing projects must receive legal and financial support from the EU. We are changing EU state aid law so that the EU no longer hinders the preferential treatment of non-profit housing. We stand alongside Deutsche Wohnen & Co in expropriating - in cities with a dysfunctional housing market such as Berlin, we want to transfer real estate groups with more than 3,000 apartments into public ownership.
? We want to support local authorities financially in acquiring decentralized housing and managing it on a non-profit basis. We want to create a European municipalization fund for this purpose. Local authorities can access this fund and thus bring public services of general interest into public hands. In Germany, this would allow housing portfolios to be taken over by real estate groups. In other European countries, homeowners who are threatened with eviction due to rising interest costs can be supported.
? Social housing must not be used to subsidize private investors. The construction of social housing must be placed permanently in the hands of non-profit actors.
? Once subsidized, always socially bound: Publicly subsidized housing must remain permanently socially bound.
? We are creating support programs from the European Investment Bank for non- profit housing and adapting the regulations in the Stability and Growth Pact,
24|
so that investments in non-profit housing are not offset against debts.
Rent cap and affordable housing
It has become the norm in the EU for people to spend more than 40 percent of their income on housing, while real estate companies use inflation, index-linked rents and energy modernization to increase their profits. The problem has become even worse in many European cities. Whether in Milan, Madrid, Mannheim or Dresden, life is becoming unaffordable for more and more people.
? We want binding rent caps and a ban on index-linked rental contracts throughout the EU. This will also slow down the construction of luxury apartments - we need more affordable housing!
? A large non-profit housing sector keeps rents affordable - as in Vienna, for example. In order to finally counteract the housing crisis, investment in affordable, social housing must be massively increased and flow into the development of a non-profit housing sector.
? Safe from dismissal: We demand permanent tenancy agreements throughout Europe as effective protection against dismissal.
Creating living space to combat homelessness
Around 700,000 people are homeless in Europe. Over the past ten years, their number has risen by 70 percent. Homelessness is a symptom of failed housing and social policies. Too little is being done about it in the European Union - in Hungary, homelessness has even been criminalized since 2018.
? The most important means of combating homelessness is an EU-wide ban on forced eviction: no one should be put out on the street! The fundamental right to housing must be implemented by the EU and all member states.
? An EU-wide strategy to combat homelessness is needed. It must enable equal access to help, healthcare and social services. Homeless people with foreign citizenship must not be discriminated against!
? Housing First! Homeless and homeless people should be given their own rented accommodation first. This lays the foundation for other social services such as addiction support or job search.
? Apartments instead of camps - no inhumane accommodation of refugees in collective accommodation! Decentralized accommodation in one's own home must become the standard throughout the EU! (See Chapter 5, "The limits of democracy: No Fortress Europe")
Socially just ecological modernization
The building sector is responsible for a large proportion of CO2 emissions: refurbishments and the heating transition are therefore urgent. Social control is needed for a socially just heating transition - otherwise real estate companies will always find ways to increase rents.
? In Germany, the modernization levy must be abolished so that the costs cannot be passed on to tenants.
? No public money to real estate sharks: We want subsidies to be linked to clear social and ecological criteria. A non-profit housing sector guarantees a socially just heating transition.
|25
? The inclusion of the building sector in the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) 2.0, because flat-rate pricing is socially unjust. Tenants have no influence on the heating and refurbishment of their homes. The proposed social climate fund is underfunded and must be increased. We want to use the money to expand the non-profit housing sector.
? In the amendment to the EU Buildings Directive (EPBD), we support EU minimum energy performance standards (MEPS), under which the buildings with the worst energy standards and insulation must be renovated first. An above-average number of low and average earners live in poorly refurbished houses. In such refurbishments, the reduction of greenhouse gases can be practically combined with improvements in everyday life for those who need it most.
? Solutions in existing buildings instead of new buildings! "Build, build, build" is not only ineffective against excessively high rents, but also unecological: excessively expensive apartments are being built and land is being sealed. Priority must be given to solutions for existing buildings. Where living space is scarce, it must also be affordable in new buildings. Sustainable building materials should be used in new builds. This includes recycled materials and wood.
? The heating transition must be implemented locally as a community and is part of public services of general interest. Local authorities are drawing up heating plans and implementing solutions at the settlement level - with heating networks operated by cooperatives or municipal utilities. The focus of the heating transition must be on heat pumps and heating networks. "Green hydrogen" is inefficient and expensive in the heating sector and therefore cannot be a solution.
? We want to create an EU fund for the heat transition that local authorities can access and use to carry out and support local heat planning and energy refurbishments together with citizens.
? Socio-ecological modernization can become a job engine and create hundreds of thousands of jobs: We are committed to good working conditions, higher wages and a training offensive instead of EU-wide dumping of craft wages.
We not only want to modernize our homes, but also our neighborhoods. The energy- efficient refurbishment of urban districts offers the opportunity to redesign public spaces and promote social infrastructure. We make urban policy together with the people: Democracy and participation in urban development, such as in Barcelona, can become the driving force behind socio-ecologically just urban policy.
? The socio-ecological conversion of urban districts is a class issue, because the green districts are the districts of the rich. This is why the focus of redevelopment and funding policy must be on neighborhoods with many social housing units.
? We want to revitalize town centers and put an end to the unecological consumption of land through new greenfield developments! To do this, we need to redesign public spaces - let's take back the villages! We demand that care centers be set up in empty shopping arcades to become the focal point of the villages.
? We want to promote youth centers, community gardens and cultural and urban open spaces without consumer pressure.

Good health and care
All people in the EU must have a right to and access to good healthcare. In reality, however, access to health is unequal: the poor are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases and disabilities. People in poorer member states die almost 10 years earlier on average. With a high level of education in Italy, you can expect to live 17 years longer on average than in Estonia with a low level of education. The market and the pursuit of profit are poor organizing principles in health policy. EU legal acts in health policy must not be based on the principles of free trade and competition. The health policy of the Member States must not be restricted by these principles. As part of public services of general interest, we want to remove care and health from the internal market and EU competition law. (See Chapter 1, "More public wealth: right of way for the public") We want care that is based on people's needs, not on the profitability of their treatment.
We want to transfer hospital and care groups into public ownership. The medical technology and pharmaceutical industries must be geared towards the common good.
? EU policy must set binding minimum standards that are guaranteed to all people living in the EU. These minimum standards should determine the scope and quality of care. Member States that have difficulties in achieving this must receive EU support. Non-profit. Healthcare must be given priority.
? Special needs, for example of people with disabilities, senior citizens or people with language and learning difficulties, must be taken into account. Easy-to-understand language and comprehensible patient information must become a matter of course.
? The Left is committed to cross-border healthcare for all people in Europe. Patients can be left to pay for healthcare services in other EU countries. In Germany, people without a residence permit are excluded from benefits. We want to change this.
? Anyone who is in another member state and needs healthcare there must receive it
- regardless of whether they are employed, unemployed or retired. Access to the healthcare systems of other EU states must be guaranteed via the EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) in a low-threshold and non-discriminatory manner.
? EU citizens who move to another EU country must not be excluded from benefits. This must be prevented by EU law. Die Linke is calling for this discrimination to be abolished in Germany.
? Information, advice and clearing centers must be set up throughout Europe to explain health services and health insurance requirements and ways to obtain health insurance.
? Health care centers must be set up at rest areas throughout Europe. They should primarily offer truck drivers and bus drivers health advice and treatment for job- specific complaints.
? Healthcare services are particularly necessary in disadvantaged urban districts. These services should be interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, i.e. include various medical disciplines. They should also provide access to medical care, geriatric care and obstetrics as well as social work.
? Outpatient care for people with mental illness must be expanded throughout Europe.
|27
Learning from the pandemic
The corona pandemic has shown that a healthcare system geared towards profit and without reserves is overwhelmed in an emergency. Hospitals are already working at their limits during normal operations. The best way to prevent a pandemic is therefore to fund the healthcare system adequately and in line with demand and end the nursing crisis. People living in poverty, on low incomes, children, the elderly and the sick have suffered particularly badly during the pandemic. This must not happen again. Better prevention is therefore also needed at EU level. Regional cooperation across national borders should be expanded. This will also make our supply systems more responsive in the event of a disaster.
? We want well-organized stockpiling of protective masks, clothing and hygiene products throughout the EU. So that everyone, regardless of income, can be protected as well as possible and doctors and nurses are equipped with the necessary equipment.
? We are committed to EU-wide monitoring in the event of a pandemic, in accordance with uniform standards.
? The pandemic is not yet over for many people: Long Covid and post-vac syndrome need further research and support for those affected.
? A European pandemic council, in which representatives of civil society and trade unions are also represented, is needed to ensure the proportionality of state action in the event of a pandemic. This includes developing strict criteria for border closures and restrictive measures that take fundamental rights into account.
? The Left is committed to fighting global pandemics with global solidarity and supporting poorer countries. To ensure that the World Health Organization (WHO) is independent, it must be better financed by the member states. Stricter rules are needed to prevent influence from corporations and lobby groups.
? Patents can be deadly. We want publicly funded vaccine research with intellectual property rights (e.g. patents) in public hands so that vital vaccines are available to everyone at low cost. The production and distribution of life-saving vaccines must not be subordinated to the profit interests of individual pharmaceutical companies.
Good and affordable care with fair working conditions
The need for care is growing all over Europe and there are too few carers everywhere. The gaps in care and care insurance are giving rise to border-crossing exploitation on the one hand and profits on the other, for example in 24-hour care. The Left is
committed to affordable and good care and to good and fair working conditions.
? We need European minimum standards for wages and working conditions in the care sector with binding staffing ratios (staffing levels).
? Everywhere in Europe, comprehensive long-term care insurance must cover the entire long-term care costs of those insured. The need for long-term care must no longer be a risk of poverty.
? We want to transform 24-hour care into regular employment with social insurance cover, statutory working hours, vacations and a minimum wage.
? We are calling for a public investment offensive for more facilities with good and affordable care, fair working conditions and more staff.
28|
? No profits from care: We want care companies to be prohibited from distributing profits. Surpluses must flow back into care. We want to revoke the listing of care companies on the stock exchange.
? We want to strengthen public and non-profit care providers through more state investment.
? We want to promote local, non-profit care platforms that provide well-trained, collectively paid and socially secure care workers to private households - an alternative to 24-hour care workers.
? Carers should receive additional pension entitlements from their unpaid care work throughout Europe, regardless of their employment status. We want to improve support services for family care throughout the EU.
? Caring relatives also need a vacation. Social long-term care insurance therefore covers the care costs for the person requiring care in Germany for six weeks. We want German long-term care insurance to also cover the costs of foreign long-term care services for vacations in EU countries.
? The training of midwives must be promoted throughout Europe. Outpatient delivery structures and inpatient obstetrics must be strengthened throughout Europe.
? A Europe-wide coordinated training program for healthcare, nursing and obstetrics is needed. The topics of poverty, social disadvantage and social medicine must be essential components of the content in all areas of training.
Free and qualified psychotherapy
Over 200 million people in the EU suffer from a mental illness. That is almost 40 percent of EU citizens. Only half of them receive adequate treatment. There is not enough psychotherapeutic care in any EU country.
Marginalized groups such as the poor or migrants are particularly affected. They have a higher risk of becoming mentally ill due to social conditions. Multiple crises increase this risk for many people. They fall into poverty and hardship as a result of the illness. In the EU, there is neither a uniformly regulated professional title for psychotherapists nor consistent cost coverage by health insurance companies.
? We want uniform standards in the EU for the qualification of psychotherapists. The name should become a protected professional title throughout Europe with comparably high quality standards.
? Psychotherapies must be able to be billed as health insurance benefits throughout the EU.
? We want to put non-physician psychotherapists on an equal footing with physician psychotherapists.
Safe and cost-effective supply of medicines
Bottlenecks in the supply of medicines have been a daily occurrence, and not just since the coronavirus pandemic. One cause is the pharmaceutical industry's strategy of relocating the production of medicines and additives to India or China, for example, for economic reasons. When supply and production chains break down, this creates gaps in supply. We want to strengthen regional economic cycles.
|29
This makes the supply of medicines in the EU safer and the EU as a whole more independent.
? The EU pharmaceutical strategy must focus on ensuring supply. If a supply bottleneck occurs, pharmaceutical companies must demonstrate that the bottleneck was unavoidable for them.
? In the negotiations on the EU Community Code relating to medicinal products for human use, the Left is committed to ensuring that the safeguarding of the supply of medicinal products is defined as an important public service task of the Member States. This public service task must be given priority in EU law over the free internal market.
? Incentives to relocate production capacities to the EU or Germany must be flanked by clear requirements for greater security of supply (diversification of manufacturing and supplier companies, robust supply chains, etc.).
? Pharmaceuticals are often imported from low-price countries to high-price countries, which jeopardizes the security of supply in the exporting countries. EU member states must be empowered to prevent this.
European Health Data Space (EHDS)
A European Health Data Space (EHDS) is being created in the EU. Health data from over 500 million EU citizens is to be collected in national electronic patient records (EPRs).
The collection of data can facilitate and improve medical research and healthcare for citizens throughout Europe. To this end, it is crucial that our data is protected in the best possible way and not released for commercial exploitation. In the global health data market, mass data is coveted by insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry and big tech companies as the "oil wells" of the future. (See Chapter 2, "Using our data for a better life instead of for profit")
? Together with German and European data protection and patient organizations, Die Linke is calling for the EU regulation to be revised so that medical confidentiality, individual personal rights such as the protection of privacy and the right to informational self-determination are protected.
? The Left rejects any commercial use of EU health data. The data stored in electronic patient files must not be traded for profit. Their use must be oriented towards the common good and serve non-commercial health research. Patients must be able to decide for themselves whether and how their data is used ("opt-in").
? The European Health Data Space must serve exclusively to further develop and improve healthcare for citizens throughout Europe. This is in line with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the General Data Protection Regulation.
Decriminalize drugs
The Left is committed t o a Europe-wide paradigm shift in drug policy: away from criminal prosecution and towards prevention, counseling and help. Only a good health and social policy can reduce risks and harm - a ban on drugs cannot do this. It neither prevents drug trafficking nor does it effectively reduce consumption. At the same time, repression ties up large amounts of financial resources:
30|
Several billion euros are spent on criminal prosecution, but only a fraction of that on aid and prevention.
? The EU should support measures in its member states that focus on prevention, help, harm reduction, decriminalization and regulation of drugs.
? The Left is campaigning for EU law and the Schengen Agreement to be amended so that they do not stand in the way of the comprehensive legalization of cannabis in the Member States. Our goal is to legalize cannabis in the EU as a whole.
Taxes against inequality and for a good future
The privatization of public property and services has been driven forward in the EU, which has increased inequality. In the search for quick profits, many rich people and corporations have poured their profits into speculation in real estate, land and care, enriching themselves at the expense of the majority of the population. Rents are shooting through the roof, care costs are rising. Food and energy companies raise prices so high in times of crisis that they make enormous extra profits.
At the same time, many governments in the EU have reduced taxes on companies' assets and profits - including in Germany. People with lower and middle incomes are being taxed more heavily. Corporations are always looking for ways to avoid paying their taxes: The EU states lose around 46 billion euros a year through tax evasion alone. This is unfair and comes at the expense of us all.
The Left says: We can no longer afford the rich! We must involve corporations more in the financing of the common good in order to abolish poverty in the EU, transform the economy socially and ecologically and strengthen public services of general interest.
This requires additional investment through loans (see Chapter 1, "For a strong European community: Redistributing from private to public") and additional revenue through taxes. We believe that the EU and its member states can steer the direction of the EU through taxation. The EU should assume responsibility where national options for action are limited, for example in the taxation of internationally active companies. Where member states have more control, the EU should ensure implementation in the countries. The EU's unanimity principle must be abolished in the area of taxation.
Otherwise, low-tax countries such as Hungary or Ireland will torpedo any progress.
Taxing high assets and inheritances fairly
Fairer taxation of wealth, inheritances and high incomes reduces economic and political power, reduces social inequality and thus strengthens democracy. We can use the higher tax revenues to pay for urgently needed teachers, educators, nurses, social workers and lifeguards at the local swimming pool. We want a Europe-wide corridor for coordinated regulations in the EU member states in order to set minimum taxation for high assets, inheritances and gifts.
? In Germany, we are campaigning for the wealth tax, which has been suspended since 1997, to be levied again. It should apply to assets (minus debts) of 1 million euros or more.
? The tax loopholes in inheritance tax must be closed. The Austrian entrepreneur's son and Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz inherited 25 billion tax-free last year. The tax rates for these super-rich should be
|31
for inheritances and gifts will be increased and the personal allowances lowered.
? The special costs of the crisis must not burden the current budget and lead to cuts.
? We want to levy a one-off capital levy to tackle the burden of the crisis.
Global minimum tax rates for companies and groups
The finance ministers of the G20 countries have agreed on a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent in 2021. However, this is not enough to effectively prevent tax competition between countries and corporate tax evasion.
? We demand a global minimum tax rate for companies of 25 percent in order to take serious action against tax competition and profit shifting
Taxing crisis profits
Companies such as Total, Shell and RWE have made record profits in the wake of the war in Ukraine thanks to enormous price increases. Such excess profits, which are significantly higher than those of previous years, cannot be attributed to increased performance or innovation, nor to increased added value for society. On the contrary, they show that corporations are exploiting crisis situations to enrich themselves at the expense of the general public. A few benefit and the vast majority have to struggle with the increased prices. We want to redistribute the extra profits to the general public. The Left demands the introduction of an EU-wide excess profits tax of 90 percent for all crisis profits. The excess profits tax should be introduced retroactively and apply permanently. The positive experiences of other countries such as Spain and Greece confirm this: Excess profits can be successfully skimmed off.
? In Germany alone, the taxation of excess profits in the energy sector would have generated up to 102 billion euros in 2022.
? The excess profits tax must be extended to other sectors that profit from war and crises. These include, for example, the arms industry, the banking sector and large online retailers such as Amazon.
Taxing speculative profits
We are fighting for a European financial transaction tax to give speculators a greater share in the financing of the community. The financial transaction tax primarily affects large short-term transactions with small profit margins. It shrinks and stabilizes the financial markets. Computerized high-frequency trading in particular has no benefit for the real economy and consumes vast amounts of energy.
? A tax rate of 0.1 percent is to be levied on every financial transaction. The aim is to introduce this tax worldwide. Until then, a uniform financial transaction tax is needed at EU level. According to the EU Commission, this tax would generate 50 billion euros a year.
? We want to abolish the flat-rate withholding tax in Germany. Instead of a cheap tax on capital gains, they should be subject to normal income tax. Those with high incomes must pay correspondingly higher rates. Minimum tax rates should be agreed in the EU.

Disempowering banks and financial markets
Not enough has been learned from the financial crises: this has been shown by the recent shake-up of the banks, the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse and the collapse of individual financial service providers such as Wirecard. Even 15 years after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers, many of the measures promised during the financial crisis have still not been implemented. A crisis in the financial sector can bring entire countries and social systems to ruin - or "only" investors or customers are damaged and defrauded of billions.
During the financial crisis, many of the banks' debts were transferred to state budgets and "socialized". When the economy is running, profits are privatized. Highly complex financial instruments (e.g. higher-grade derivatives) continue to pose major risks - there is no benefit for the community associated with them.
? The left wants to reduce the financial sector to a serving function for society. The financial markets should be slowed down and their volume massively reduced. Speculation in foodstuffs should be banned. Stricter and lower position limits must be created for trading in agricultural commodity derivatives.
? If ever larger parts of public services are organized privately, high returns must be generated and the financial market takes control. We want to prevent this. We want hospital, care and real estate groups to be delisted from the stock exchange.
? In future, only those financial transactions, services and instruments that also create a macroeconomic and/or social benefit will be permitted. Instead of permitting all financial practices that are not expressly prohibited, as has been the case to date, financial instruments will in future have to be expressly approved by a financial MOT before they can be put into circulation.
? So-called shadow banks such as hedge funds and the "gray" capital market operate outside of conventional regulations. They harbor the risk of new financial crises and are a threat to the global economy. This is why Die Linke advocates strict regulation and financial supervision of shadow banks.
The large investment banks with their risky business can s t i l l r e l y on being rescued at the taxpayer's expense. The newly created instruments for resolving banks in the event of a crisis, including the bank resolution fund, are not realistically designed to deal with acute difficulties in practice. This was already evident in 2017 in the case of the liquidity crisis at Spain's Banco Popular. The rules have no preventive effect in preventing future banking crises. European banks are still too large and too closely linked to other sectors to go bankrupt like any other company that has not done well.
? Banks must be downsized and investment banking must be wound up. As a first step, investment banking should be isolated from the other business areas. Following the example of savings banks and cooperative banks, banks must be transferred to common ownership and democratically managed and controlled.
? All banks should commit to a business model that serves the needs of society and the real economy: 1. payment services, 2. simpler and more secure savings instruments and 3. financing of public and private investments.
|33
? The Left is fundamentally in favor of a European deposit guarantee scheme, but only for institutions and depositors of banks with a similar structure and risk profile in Europe. Savings banks and cooperative banks should not have to answer for the speculative losses of international investment banks.
? We call for the Basel III capital adequacy rules to be fully implemented in order to improve the financial stability of banks.
Making wealth and concentration of power visible
? We want to increase the transparency of assets and are calling for the establishment of an EU asset register (European Asset Registry).
? Europe needs effective transparency rules to be successful in the search for dirty money from crime, corruption and (not only) Russian oligarchs.
? A provision is needed under European law that grants the public access to data from the national transparency registers.
? The blind spots in the international exchange of tax information must be addressed. A first step is increased transparency through public, country-specific reporting (public country-by-country reporting). Corporations must disclose turnover, profits and taxes paid for each country in which they do business.
Drying up tax havens and prosecuting financial crime
At least 90 billion euros in tax revenue is lost every year because profits and assets are "parked" in tax havens. We want to combat money laundering and subsidy fraud more effectively and dry up tax havens - including those "Made in Germany".
? An end to tax avoidance: The race to the bottom must be stopped. If profits are shifted to low-tax jurisdictions, they must be taxed in the individual countries in which the group is active. Corporations must be taxed (more) at the place of their economic activities and sales (withholding tax). This applies in particular to the taxation of excess profits.
? Cut links to tax havens: We want to levy a withholding tax of 50 percent on all payments (dividends, interest and license fees) from companies that flow into non- cooperative states. This will make tax evasion unattractive. Companies may only deduct the tax if all tax-relevant information is disclosed.
? The Left Party is calling for the establishment of a European financial police force to investigate and combat criminal corporate practices such as tax evasion, tax fraud, money laundering and corruption.
? The Left is committed to stricter money laundering regulation for the cross-border online gambling market. There has been a long period of hesitation here and much has been overlooked.
European monetary policy
The Left is calling for the democratization of the European Central Bank (ECB). In addition to the goal of price stability, its mandate should also be extended to full employment and economic development. The ECB must also be allowed to finance government spending so that the artificial insolvency risk of euro states can be eliminated.
34|
is prevented. Even a guarantee for government bonds would de facto make them risk- free. This is because the ECB, as the creator of the euro currency, can never go bankrupt. Only it can be the lender of last resort. There is no inflationary risk because the ECB remains committed to its inflation target of 2 percent.
The UK and Canada provide proof that this works without any problems: The finance ministers there also sell bonds directly to the central bank.
? The EU treaties must be amended to allow the ECB to finance the state.
? In the short term and in accordance with the treaty, this function could also be fulfilled by the purchase of bonds from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and national development banks.
? We want the ECB to be democratically controlled by the European Parliament and no longer subject to the influence of financial lobbyists. Especially in times of financial and economic crises, central banks are key political actors.
? We want democratic control of the ECB. The governing bodies of the ECB - such as the Governing Council, Executive Board and President - should be elected by the European Parliament. The fundamental and long-term objectives of monetary policy should be discussed and decided in Parliament. Especially in times of financial and economic crises and in the socio-ecological transformation, central banks are key players and must be politically controlled.
? The instrument of euro bonds is to be expanded to finance the great need for public investment, including the economic reconstruction of Europe after the coronavirus pandemic and the energy price crisis. If the ECB guarantees these bonds, there is no liability risk. (See Chapter 1, "For a strong European community: Redistributing from private to public")
? In the inflation crisis, the ECB is trying to combat inflation by raising the key interest rate. This does more harm than good: Urgently needed investments are being slowed down and prices are not falling. Part of the inflation is profit-driven and must be combated through fiscal policy. Excessively high corporate profits must be skimmed off with an excess profits tax. (See chapter "Taxing crisis profits").
? We want to link the interest rates for savers to the interest rates of banks so that they can pass on the rising prime rate and not make money from savers.
? We are calling for a cap on overdraft interest rates: the interest rate for overdraft facilities and overdrafts may not be more than 5 percentage points above the ECB's key interest rate. In this way, we protect people who are on the edge of subsistence and have to use their overdraft facilities frequently.
No power to the internet giants: Putting BigTechs in their place
Money and currency must remain part of state sovereignty; we reject creeping privatization. Internet giants (Amazon and Co) and financial technology companies (e.g. PayPal or N26) must be subject to the same rules and laws that apply to conventional financial service providers (e.g. banks and insurance companies).
? The Left is in favor of the introduction of a digital euro by the ECB. The digital euro should be a legal tender guaranteed by the ECB, which private individuals can hold to a limited extent and without interest in current accounts at the ECB. Only with a public alternative to the payment systems of the major
|35
We can counteract the enormous financial technology and data power of Internet companies and credibly enforce a European level of data protection. The technical conditions must be created to ensure anonymous payments, at least for small amounts.
EU taxonomy and sustainable investments
The Left Party advocates a binding evaluation and classification system (taxonomy) for financial investments at European level so that sustainable investments can be identified transparently. In addition to climate protection, social aspects must also be given greater consideration and mapped using strict criteria. The guiding principle should be the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
? Investments in nuclear or gas energy are not sustainable and must be removed from the EU taxonomy. We reject greenwashing with the EU taxonomy: for example, the inclusion of conventional ships and aircraft or offsetting measures for biodiversity loss.
? Public banks, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Kreditanstalt für den Wiederaufbau (KfW), should only be allowed to make sustainable investments. The ECB must not continue to buy up bonds from companies with high CO2 emissions and thereby undermine climate protection. It needs strong social and ecological standards and must live up to its responsibility in promoting climate protection.

Chapter 2: Restructuring the economy in a socially and ecologically just way
The economy must serve the people. It should satisfy our needs and not the greed of shareholders for profit. Decisions on investment and production must finally be made democratically and not be left to a few super-rich in society. After all, we have to tackle the greatest challenge facing humanity this century: the ecological crisis caused by climate change, the destruction of nature and the scarcity of resources. The EU is responding to this with a green-liberal modernization strategy: tax breaks for the climate-neutral conversion of companies and technological innovation are intended to create new green profit opportunities. New green markets are to be created. But the costs are borne by the citizens.
This is opposed by national conservative and extreme right-wing parties. They deny the ecological crisis and promise "business as usual" in fossil capitalism, with oil and gas imports from dictatorships, dirty brown coal and an industry that can continue to make a profit at the expense of people and nature.
We do not want a green-painted capitalism that further exacerbates social injustice. The coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine have shown the vulnerability of supply chains and transnational networks (such as pipelines and the SWIFT international payment system). The globalized economy is extremely susceptible to crises. The USA, China and the EU are vying for supremacy in the production of green technologies and are trying to divide the world into spheres of influence. Intensified competition, trade wars, rearmament, violent conflicts and even wars are further exacerbating the ecological crisis. Scarce resources and financial means, which are urgently needed to restructure the economy, are also being squandered in an economic arms race. Each power bloc is trying to become the market leader for green technologies and outdo the competition. As a result, we are losing time and resources in the fight against the climate catastrophe and putting human lives at risk.
We say: The way out of climate catastrophe, international escalation and social inequality begins with a fundamentally different economic policy. Cosmetic corrections are not enough. Our society needs a socially and ecologically just economic turnaround. We put people's well-being before profits!
In its economic policy, the European Union has so far focused on more profit for companies, more market and more competition. It has limited public ownership, public management and public control. Every local authority is aware of the need to put contracts and services out to tender in such a way that any provider in the EU can apply. The winners are usually the lowest bidders at the expense of people and the environment. The socio-ecological transformation also requires a change in tendering policy that not only creates standardized products and services. The opportunities to obtain tenders for new, innovative solutions must be expanded.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us the shortcomings of the market: too few masks, vaccines and air filters for schools. Supply chains collapsed because there were too few regional economic cycles, too little regional production and it took too long to have urgently needed things produced. We want to change that. A strong, independent economy in the EU must mean that we steer industry towards a socially and ecologically just future with good work
|37
and good wages and we strengthen regional economic cycles: we want to produce primarily where things are consumed. We are driving forward the sustainable raw materials transition and the agricultural transition.
For Die Linke, it is clear that the economic turnaround can only succeed together with employees. Only with an expansion of democracy and co-determination, with new perspectives on sensible and climate-friendly (industrial) production, with social security systems that protect against poverty, can courage and hope for a better life grow out of fear of change. Transformation then means a gain in quality of life. Our goal is a good life for all - not profit for the few.
Transforming the industry fairly
The economy can only be restructured in a climate-friendly way with state intervention. It is time for economic policy to move away from neoliberal myths and focus on public investment for a socially and ecologically just economy.
With the NextGenerationEU investment programme, the EU has taken out loans on a large scale for the first time (750 billion euros), which are to be invested primarily in greening and digitalization. The EU's "Green Deal" is intended to be a key driver of innovation and growth for industry and the economy and secure Europe a leading role in the competition for the green technologies of the future. The EU Commission has responded to the USA's major investment program (the Inflation Reduction Act) with its own legislation (the Net Zero Industry Act). However, the EU's "Green Deal" is not even sufficient to achieve the climate targets it has set itself. The EU's investment programmes are primarily aimed at improving the competitiveness of corporations and maximizing their profits.
The EU's goal is green-painted capitalism. Nothing should change in the distribution of profits and wages, of private and public and of social wealth. The EU's industrial aid is not linked to labor law and social criteria - this is even different in the USA.
Instead, the Left is committed to the social and ecological restructuring of industry in the EU. There will be no "green capitalism". We need an industry that preserves the planet for our children, that strengthens democracy and co-determination in the restructuring process and does not dismantle them, and that makes everyday life better for everyone. We can achieve this with an active industrial policy that creates good jobs, protects the climate and focuses on sensible and sustainable production. We want an industrial policy that builds, rebuilds and dismantles. And at the same time strengthen public ownership and co-determination. We want to close tax loopholes and levy a minimum tax on transnational corporations. (See Chapter 1, "Taxes against inequality and for a good future") Subsidies and investment aid for a CO2-free industry must be linked to social conditions for good work, collective bargaining, concrete employment figures, training quotas and location guarantees. Companies that cut jobs must pay back subsidies. No companies in tax havens outside the EU should be subsidized. Industrial subsidies must be tied to clear social, ecological and labor law criteria. Dividend payouts must be prohibited when state bailout money is used.
? With the help of contracts for difference and climate protection contracts (CCfDs), we want to promote climate-friendly technology in the conversion and equipping of production facilities and protect employment: Energy-intensive industrial companies receive financial aid for
38|
the conversion to low-carbon production in the amount of the difference between the CO2 avoidance costs and the CO2 certificate price. In this way, industrial companies remain competitive during the transformation and employment can be protected.
? European state aid law will be amended: The Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF) already adopted by the EU must be extended and made permanent. Procedures must be accelerated overall.
? In particular, the competition and state aid regulations in Articles 101 and 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) must be amended: Exceptions under antitrust and subsidy law must be permitted if the aid serves the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). And/or if the aid makes a significant contribution to the social and ecological transformation of the economy.
? The rules for awarding public contracts must be changed so that municipalities and other public clients are allowed to tender and make decisions based on social, labor and environmental criteria. Public money will only be awarded for good work and compliance with collective bargaining agreements. (See Chapter 1, "For strong municipalities")
? We want to introduce an intra-European solidarity mechanism to support the industry of financially weaker member states if the law on state aid is relaxed. The solidarity mechanism is intended to prevent economic imbalances in the EU from becoming even more pronounced because countries such as Germany or France can organize higher levels of financial aid.
? The European Commission's strategic funding projects, IPCEIs (Important Projects of Common European Interests), must be expanded and at the same time linked to stricter environmental and social criteria. In addition to semiconductors, green hydrogen and batteries, new industrial conglomerates and clusters must also be established for wind and solar power. Research into leap innovations in nanotechnology and climate technology in particular must be closely linked to these locations. An IPCEI project must also be put out to tender for a European rail and local transport network as well as for the production and maintenance of the necessary trains and buses.
? Funds for research and development to strengthen a regional industrial structure are to be controlled by regional economic and transformation councils in which, in addition to the regional government and companies, trade unions, environmental and social associations also have equal voting rights.
Many companies in the EU do not have the size and financial resources to cope with the tasks of transformation. For this reason, direct state participation in companies must also be made possible under European law with the aim of accelerating the socio- ecological transformation and implementing new forms of economic democracy.
? The Left Party is calling for the establishment of a European industrial foundation. Financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the foundation should specifically acquire shares in companies that play a key role in the transformation and steer the climate-neutral transition. European public control will undermine the neoliberal logic of competition in the EU, in which corporations are positioned against each other as "national champions". Stronger public control through ownership shares can also counteract the formation of monopolies.
? The establishment of a socio-ecological public industrial structure ensures that not only the costs of the transformation are borne by the people of Europe, but that the profits flow back to the public purse and thus
|39
be subject to democratic control. The workforce and society as a whole can have a greater say in investment and production decisions.
Structural change on site together with the people
The socio-ecological restructuring of industry affects European regions differently. In particular, regions where coal is mined or cars are produced are facing major challenges. The change will be at the expense of employees and local people if no countermeasures are taken. There are a large number of support programs at EU level. We are simplifying them and focusing on a uniform transformation strategy.
Transformation funding benefits people in the regions and is linked to social and ecological criteria. Companies must offer their employees new job prospects when they reorganize their production structure. They must be given the opportunity to transition into "green" jobs and occupations that are in demand (for example in care or public transport).
? We call for the Just Transition Fund to be expanded: Not only coal regions, but all regions affected by the transition should be supported. This applies in particular to regions affected by the necessary restructuring of the automotive industry. (See Chapter 3, "More mobility with less traffic")
? In the regions affected by structural change, we want to set up economic and transformation councils that have access to the money from the transformation funds and shape the transformation on the ground. (See Chapter 2, "Transforming industry")
The European structural and funding policy is intended to achieve social equality between the regions. However, the EU Cohesion Report of 2022 shows that this is hardly measurable. Funding must be aimed more consistently at greater social equality! This is possible if funding is geared more towards public and non-profit- oriented services of general interest. Although Germany pays a lot into the EU, the (eastern) German regions also benefit in particular from EU cohesion policy and the EU structural funds. Without the European funds, many projects in the municipalities could not have been realized.
? We want to better equip the EU Structural Funds. This will strengthen local authorities and public services of general interest as the foundation of a socially and ecologically just society.
Strengthening regional economic cycles
We want to reduce the distance between producers and consumers: Preference should also be given to production where consumption takes place. This will make supply chains shorter and more ecological. Instead of sending industrial components across Europe to exploit the cheapest wages, we want to strengthen integrated production processes. This secures local jobs and strengthens the regions away from the metropolitan areas. The following applies: production as local as possible, as global as necessary!
By promoting regional tourism, we save on traffic. With the energy transition, we produce electricity locally instead of turning Spain into a photovoltaic park for Europe. The agricultural transition will create and strengthen local supply structures instead of promoting industrial agriculture.
? We strengthen social and ecological criteria in public tenders, procurements and subsidies: We take into account transportation emissions as well as local training and employment rates, thereby supporting local companies.
40|
? We strengthen regional products and distribution structures by linking production and distribution cooperatives. Grassroots movements that want to establish regional value creation structures should benefit from EU regional funds.
? Revitalize the town centers: We promote social centers everywhere in the EU! Social centers are the starting point for new neighborly communities and serve as meeting places. They are spaces for basic services such as the post office and bank, civic initiatives and drinking coffee together. We want to revitalize marketplaces and strengthen the retail sector. We want to promote weekly markets with local producers to provide healthy and sustainable products close to home.
In principle, we want to strengthen public investment in non-profit services and public services of general interest. The idea of a community with public spaces and services for social inclusion and integration must be strengthened in the European social model.
For the socio-ecological raw materials transition
The socially and ecologically just restructuring of our economy must use raw materials more sustainably. Metal production has almost tripled worldwide since 2000. More than 93.5 percent of the metal extracted from the earth worldwide is iron, primarily for energy-intensive steel production. Resource extraction is reaching its natural limits.
The production of green technologies is also dependent on many raw materials that are not available in sufficient quantities in the EU o r that have not yet been extracted in the EU. The dependence on imports of rare earths and metals is particularly high. By 2050, for example, the EU will need 60 times more lithium than it does today. The consumption of raw materials such as graphite or cobalt could increase 15-fold by 2050.
There is a threat of increasing geopolitical conflicts over dwindling resources. At the same time, more and more energy is needed to extract the resources. Mining often takes place under unacceptable conditions: Human rights are violated, water is contaminated and the environment is destroyed. This is the price we pay for our hunger for raw materials. To protect the climate and the natural limits of our ecosystem, the extraction of raw materials must therefore be reduced.
? The consumption of primary raw materials in the EU must fall by 10 percent by 2030.
? We combine climate protection and the reduction of metallic raw materials: We are driving forward the mobility transition (see chapter 3, "More mobility with less traffic") and building a European circular economy.
? We anchor and strengthen human rights and environmental standards in all EU laws.
? We do not want mining in nature conservation areas. The local population must be involved in mining projects and value creation. We want to ban deep sea mining internationally. The EU should campaign for a moratorium.
? The mass production of green technology must not be based on the exploitation of nature and people in the countries of the Global South. We do not want "green colonialism". To this end, we are calling for stronger supply chain legislation and the inclusion of strong social and environmental standards in EU trade agreements. (See chapter 4, "Fair trade policy: cooperation instead of competition")
? We want to further restrict the trade in illegally harvested timber through strict rules and internationally coordinated controls and institutions.
|41
More circular economy, less waste
The raw materials transition can only succeed if more utilized resources are fed back into production, thus creating a circular economy. Capitalist exploitation with its inherent compulsion for unlimited growth has led us into a throwaway society: New products are bought more quickly if the old ones break faster or can no longer be repaired or updated. We need to force the unleashed market back into social and ecological channels: stop pointless production. We want to get out of the throwaway society and into the circular economy, for which we need stricter requirements for durability. No predetermined breaking points! Our goal is to make products last as long as possible. We want to repair and reuse instead of throwing away. If something has to be disposed of, it should be recycled in the best possible way so that we can return valuable raw materials t o	the cycle.
Take smartphones, for example: on average, people in Germany buy a new device every three years. That's around 22 million per year. Permanently installed batteries, missing updates for older devices and glued individual parts that make repairs difficult tempt people to buy new ones. Only 45% of old devices arrive at a recycling center, and the products are built in such a way that the valuable rare earths can only be recovered at great expense. A profitable business for manufacturers at the expense of sustainability.
? The Left Party demands: higher statutory recycling quotas and higher recyclate use quotas in the EU.
? We want to extend the eco-design specifications for products to create requirements for durability, updateability, upgradeability, reparability, reusability and recyclability.
? We want manufacturers to be responsible for the costs of taking back, transporting, refurbishing or disposing of their products.
Avoid waste
Around 33 million tons of waste are exported from the EU every year. The waste often ends up in countries in the Global South, where it is disposed of and processed under dramatic social and ecological conditions. We want to combat the already illegal dumping of electronic waste (e-waste) more intensively.
? We want to reduce the volume of waste overall: To this end, we are also calling for a reduction in disposable packaging for vendors and a standardized deposit system for disposable and reusable drinks bottles in the EU.
? We want to ban waste exports from the EU.
? Waste treatment and waste disposal must be publicly owned as part of the provision of basic needs. They must not be privatized. If privatization has already taken place, Die Linke will fight for remunicipalization. This is the only way to guarantee social and ecological waste management.
? We are committed to using usable waste free of charge. We want to legalize food rescue - so-called containerization. We want to drastically reduce the generation of food waste. (See chapter 2, "For socio-ecological agriculture").
42|
For socio-ecological agriculture
One third of EU funds are made available for agriculture. Agriculture has been liberalized in the EU and by the EU. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has not been used to advance the overdue socio-ecological restructuring of agriculture and rural areas to the extent required. Above all, it secures the profits of agricultural corporations. Large parts of agriculture are partly responsible for the loss of biodiversity. The EU must abandon its focus on competition and exports. Instead, regional production, processing and value creation that are environmentally friendly, healthier and socially responsible should be promoted. A prerequisite for vibrant rural areas is the development of local food strategies and a regional circular economy in cooperation with all stakeholders.
? Agricultural subsidies, especially the so-called area premiums, must be used according to social, ecological and welfare-oriented criteria and for a sustainable restructuring of agriculture and food.
? Good work in agriculture with nationwide statutory minimum wages: Jobs subject to social insurance contributions must also be the norm for family members and seasonal workers. We want to expand support for young farmers. We want to replace the CAP's flat-rate support for young farmers throughout the EU with support that is not tied to specific areas.
? Land must not be turned into an object of speculation. We want to ban land grabbing
- including through non-transparent share deals - and safeguard food sovereignty.
? The land market needs transparency. To achieve this, we want to make land registers public.
? We demand an EU land law that ensures a socially just distribution of agricultural land and soil fertility. State lease contracts must be awarded according to social and ecological criteria. We want to introduce a rent and purchase price brake that facilitates access to land for people with little or no money, land owners who work for the common good and agricultural start-ups.
? We demand a land fund so that the public stock grows. Public land must not be further privatized.
? More bees, more beetles, for insect-friendly agriculture: We want to drastically reduce the use of chemical pesticides and chemical weed killers. We reject the idea of dividing areas into protective and dirty areas. Plant protection products and multiple crop rotations must be reduced. We advocate the basic principle of integrated plant protection: Priority for biological, breeding, cultivation and cultivation technology measures over chemical agents.
? We oppose an extension of the approval for glyphosate, which has been classified by the WHO as probably carcinogenic. We demand a ban on the production and export of highly hazardous active ingredients for plant protection products. The monopolies and oligopolies in the seed, agrochemical and fertilizer industries, in food production and in the food trade must be broken up. We want to promote the development of safe plant protection methods.
? Forests in the EU must be preserved and managed sustainably. We want to reforest more according to ecological criteria.
|43
? We are calling for binding criteria and controls for animal husbandry on farms and are campaigning for a ban on cages. We have successfully fought for this with the European citizens' initiative against cages, now it must become law. We want to shape the transition to climate-, environment- and animal welfare-friendly livestock farming in a socially just way with diversification and debt relief programs.
? Live animal transports must be restricted. We want to completely ban the transportation of animals over four hours and to third countries.
? We demand a ban on fur farming in line with the successful EU Citizens' Initiative 2023.
? We demand voluntary exit programs for farmers from animal husbandry.
? We advocate the expansion of premiums in agriculture for the planting of pulses, for the promotion of consumption and for the upgrading of soils. This is part of a protein strategy and a sustainable arable farming concept.
? We want to develop a comprehensive support and training program for farmers that provides financial support and creates knowledge for the socio-ecological agricultural transition.
? We want to reduce feed imports. There must be no speculation with food. We want to ban the import of biofuels from foodstuffs such as maize and grain into the EU (and Germany).
? Food speculation, which makes a few rich people richer, must be banned so that people in Europe and around the world do not go hungry because of high food prices.
? There must be a fair distribution of profit and risk in the production chain. Producers who bear the greatest risk must also receive the greatest profit. In this way, food remains affordable and can be produced to cover costs.
? Legal conditions must be created for fair negotiations between farmers and food retailers on general conditions, delivery terms and prices.
? We are committed to EU-wide transparent and reliable origin, sustainability and regional labeling (Sustainable Food System Law).
? 80 percent of the population reject genetic engineering on their plates. We reject the cultivation of transgenic plants in agriculture, including so-called new genomic techniques, and patents on seeds, plants, animals and other life. They endanger biodiversity and increase the dependence of producers on overpowering global market players. The EU's planned suspension of general labeling for the majority of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) must be prevented. Otherwise, consumers will no longer have a choice. The precautionary principle must once again take precedence over the principle of innovation.
? We need a Europe-wide anti-discard law: an immediate ban on discarding food suitable for consumption in all areas of the value chain.
? Together with the alliance "We're fed up", Die Linke is calling for the EU to promote animal, climate and environmentally friendly agriculture in future and for farmers who implement this to receive good working conditions and fair prices.
44|
Overall, the agricultural turnaround must be geared towards making healthy and affordable food available to everyone in the EU without destroying the opportunities of future generations or people in other countries.
Digitization is fair
The EU has made digitalization one of its priorities and wants to use billions of euros of public money to promote the development, dissemination and use of digital technologies at all levels. This is not about technologies for a fair online world for all or for good social and climate-friendly public services. The aim is to help the European IT industry to play a leading role in international competition. To this end, IT research centers and IT companies are to be promoted, sufficient areas of application are to be developed and databases are to be made usable in order to enable product development and create markets for these applications. European IT companies should be able to compete with American and Chinese companies. Without regulation, there is a threat of increasing surveillance, greater social division, the dismantling of social rights and the further erosion of public services - all in the interests of the corporations. The high energy and resource consumption of digital applications threatens to accelerate the climate collapse. We are committed to ensuring that digitalization contributes to solving societal problems instead of focusing primarily on profits and control.
Freeing the Internet from corporations
We stand for a radical rethink towards platforms oriented towards the common good and truly social networks instead of profit machines and platform capitalism. The internet giants Facebook (Meta), Google (Alphabet), Amazon and Co control 70 to 80 percent of the entire digital market and design their offerings in the interests of their own profits. Real freedom of choice, freedom of opinion and informational self- determination are lost in the process. Alternative offerings have hardly stood a chance so far. The EU regulation on digital markets is intended to eliminate this imbalance, but its rules do not have to be complied with for another three years and not all monopolies are covered. With clear rules and support concepts, we are countering the corporate Internet with concepts geared towards the common good. We want to gradually free the digital world from capitalism.
? In order to take action against the unscrupulous business models of companies, we are campaigning for a ban on tracking and personalized advertising.
? Online services must work across different providers, have open interfaces and it must be possible to transfer your own data to other providers.
? We want to promote public and cooperative platforms for services for the common good, for example an app for Europe-wide mobility services, for fair room rentals ("Fairbnb") and a care platform with cooperative and non-profit care providers.
? Free software must be permanently promoted, especially for universal basic software and open standards. Software financed with public money must be open software. This applies above all to public administration and public companies.
|45
Artificial intelligence that benefits everyone
Over the next ten years, the EU intends to spend a lot of money on promoting the development and market for AI applications. Many of the AI applications known to the public are primarily for the profit of companies and have little added value for society. At the same time, they are sometimes associated with high risks. Consumer protection and ethical standards can only be ensured if the algorithms are comprehensible - something that companies generally have no interest in. We want to promote AI applications that can be expected to benefit society. In other areas, we want to limit or prevent the use of AI. This is because the energy consumption for AI is also huge, especially in the development phase. Its widespread use is rarely possible in an energy- saving way.
? The EU should promote research into socially useful applications of artificial intelligence and publicly fund critical research into the risks of artificial intelligence.
? In sensitive areas, explainability, traceability of processes, transparency of how decisions are made and transparency of the data used to train the AI must be guaranteed.
? Decisions that are made by AI and have an impact on humans must always be comprehensible and open to objection (and not by an AI instance or chat software).
? AI systems that violate fundamental rights must be banned: We want to ban automated facial recognition and behavioral classification in publicly accessible spaces.
? No AI systems that evaluate performance, learning or social behavior may be used in schools.
Using our data for a better life instead of for profit
Every action on the internet reveals our preferences to corporations and makes us (more) predictable and controllable. With its data strategy, the EU wants to make masses of additional data usable for research and IT development and promote a "single market for data". In addition to data from networked household appliances, this also includes health data in the European Health Data Space, mobility data and data from public administrations. This data is often highly sensitive and fundamentally affects the protection of privacy. In the hands of employers or insurance companies, it can jeopardize people's livelihoods. In the hands of media corporations or surveillance authorities, they (already) enable manipulation and jeopardize democracy, freedom of opinion and freedom of assembly. The collection, storage and use of this data must therefore be strictly limited and controlled in the interests of personal rights and the common good. This is in tension with companies' interest in being able to use as much data as possible for as many applications as possible - including those yet to be explored. Companies don't just use our data to develop voice computers or cancer drugs. They also use this data to develop business models in order to tap into new sources of profit in public budgets and to compete with previously publicly provided services (in the transport sector, for example, Uber, Moia and co). We want to ensure that data is protected and used exclusively for public welfare purposes.
46|
? Purpose limitation of data use: Health data, for example, may only be used for health research, not for personalized advertising. (See Chapter 1, "European Health Data Space (EHDS)")
? Data may only go to recipients who have a proven interest and competence in research, not to Google or Palantir.
? Common good clause: Research must serve the common good, not just the profit interests of companies.
? Research on socially important issues must be publicly funded.
? The results of publicly funded research must be publicly accessible. It must not be the case that the results of publicly funded research are protected by patents and have to be bought back from the public at great expense.
? We reject the concept of data as tradable property. It must be possible to transfer data from networked devices to devices from other manufacturers; standard formats and access rights to this data are fundamental to this. Independent workshops must have access to the data, just as users must have full sovereignty over personal data.

Chapter 3 Climate justice
We are already feeling the dramatic change in the climate. Forest fires, water shortages, droughts and hot summers are becoming the norm. It's not just the climate catastrophe: The planet's ecological system is threatening to collapse. Careless economic activity is overstepping natural boundaries and putting profit first - rather than the needs of people and our survival on the planet.
Are we all in the same boat? No: some people finance a parallel world. Are we all equally responsible? No. The ecological footprint is extremely unevenly distributed. This is true between rich and poor countries, for the rich and the poor of the world - and also within the European Union. The richest 1 percent of the population in Germany emits 35 times as much CO2 as the poorest. 800 super-rich people in Germany have CO2 emissions that are 1,000 times higher than the average German. At the same time, the poor are most affected by environmental change and pollution.
Those who own wealth are better able to protect themselves from heat, drought and flooding. The poor cannot. The destruction of nature threatens our material livelihoods and is also becoming a class issue in Germany.
The policies of the EU Commission and the traffic light government in Germany will not succeed in achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. More courage is needed for a socially just and ecologically sustainable transformation: We need clear regulations and guidelines, especially for corporations. In particular, we need to restructure the sectors that have not yet contributed to achieving the climate targets: Transport and housing. In both cases, powerful corporate interests are putting the brakes on restructuring. The Left advocates a socially and ecologically just transformation: We protect tenants and people on low and middle incomes from the costs. We create alternatives for more mobility and a better quality of life in cities and villages. The transition to renewable energies must go hand in hand with affordable and socially scaled prices and must not exclude large companies from the rules. On the contrary: those who pollute the most must be regulated the most. Many things in our lives will change. We need to fundamentally reorganize the way we do business, how we live, work and spend our leisure time. The policies of the EU and the German government mean that people who have no alternative to a car have to pay a higher price for petrol and diesel. Tenants who do not have the option of changing their heating are forced to pay higher heating costs.
At the same time, the super-rich can continue to jet around the world unhindered and heat their villas because they don't mind the additional costs. As a result, acceptance of climate protection measures is dwindling.
We want to make the super-rich more responsible. Many people feel let down by the government's misguided policies in the energy crisis. Right-wing politicians are trying to use this to create a mood against climate protection. But energy prices have not risen because of climate protection, but because the energy companies have seen an opportunity to make extra profits from the war. And because the European electricity market is structured in a way that favors extra profits. Only with public money could the horrendous prices of the corporations be fended off. What is needed: more public ownership in the energy supply sector and more guidelines for pricing. The market will not fix it, we have to set limits to the market. We are making the socio-ecological transformation together with the employees. We are strengthening co-determination and campaigning for
48|
a binding job and income guarantee for employees. We want a regional supply system that is oriented towards the common good: expanding free public transport for users as an alternative to the car. Locally produced, inexpensive renewable energy supply; industry that focuses on producing ecologically sensible things in a socially just way: Streetcars instead of electric SUVs, heat pumps instead of hydrogen heaters. This will create prosperity and a better quality of life for all instead of the few: The ecological transformation is a social transformation or it will not succeed.
Energy: how to do it fairly
The EU has tightened climate legislation over the past four years. The targets for emissions reduction and energy efficiency have been tightened. Dependence on fossil fuel imports is to be reduced. However, the measures are not enough to meet the 1.5 degree target in the Paris Climate Agreement. They are not geared towards the EU's remaining CO2 budget. G e r m a n y , of all countries, with its green energy and economics minister, is blocking action at key points. The sector targets were abolished in the German Climate Protection Act and new gas overcapacities are being created with the expansion of LNG - the energy transition is being slowed down.
We want to make the EU climate-neutral by 2040. The EU's current plans are not enough to achieve this. In order to combat climate change and implement the Paris climate targets, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced quickly. Otherwise, the total amount of CO2 emissions will exceed the remaining budget available to the EU. To achieve this, the targets for the share of renewable energies, the reduction of greenhouse gases and energy efficiency for 2030 must be tightened.
? The share of renewable energies in consumption in the EU should increase to at least 50 percent by 2030. Primary energy consumption in the EU is to fall by 40 percent by 2030 compared to the year 2000. The targets must be translated into binding national targets for each member state.
? EU emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases must be reduced by at least 70 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and by 90 to 95 percent by 2040. To ensure that all member states comply with this limit, there are to be binding CO2 budgets for each member state, which can be used to regularly review the pathways for reducing emissions.
? By 2035, 100 per cent of electricity generation in the entire EU must consist of renewable energies and be organized as decentrally as possible. This is technically possible, as studies have shown. But these goals can only be achieved if they are supported by effective regulatory measures and a historic investment program. (See Chapter 1, "For a strong European community: Redistributing from private to public")
Energy transition socially just instead of energy market
The EU Commission's climate and energy policy relies primarily on the market. But the market is not regulating it: electricity prices are exploding while corporations are enriching themselves. Energy poverty in the EU is on the rise. Emissions trading has been extended to the transport and heating sectors - this will place an even greater burden on people in the EU. Emissions trading fails to address the problem that most emissions are caused by corporations and people with a lot of money. The Left is committed to clear guidelines and wants to promote sustainable alternatives more strongly: with public money,
|49
which then also leads to public ownership and participation. Publicly owned energy supplies will make affordable and socially differentiated prices possible. We are fighting for a supply of electricity and heat that is not in the hands of corporations, but of citizens, municipalities and cooperatives. We want to organize their generation and distribution as decentrally as possible and as centrally as necessary. The EU's internal energy market routes electricity and gas throughout Europe and markets it via exchanges. We, on the other hand, want electricity from municipal utilities and local solar and wind power plants.
? Price controls instead of electricity rip-offs: We want to create low-cost base tariffs for the average consumption of electricity and heating energy. Electricity prices must be more closely monitored, controlled and made more socially just. In Germany, we are calling for an energy tax for the rich to finance socially just prices.
? The aim of the electricity market system must be to make affordable electricity available to all consumers instead of allowing corporations to make profits. A small number of expensive power plants powered by fossil fuels must no longer be allowed to set the prices for the entire electricity market.
? We reject the merit order principle in its current form. A climate-friendly electricity market system must exclude unproductive excess profits. Should they nevertheless occur due to external shocks, they must be consistently skimmed off.
? Excess profit tax for crisis profiteers: We want to introduce a permanent minimum tax of 90 percent on the excess profits of fossil fuel companies. Investments in renewable energies may be offset. To ensure that the profits of oil companies can also be effectively taxed, we want to introduce a withholding tax and dry up tax havens. (See chapter 1,
"Taxes against inequality and for a good future")
? Energy independence through public ownership: Most of our future energy supply still has to be built. The public sector should be heavily involved in the development of renewable energies. In this way, we can bring large parts of energy production back into public hands. Massive investments are needed to (re)locate wind turbines and solar factories in the EU.
? Electricity, heating and gas grids in the EU member states must be transferred to public ownership, democratically controlled and coordinated at European level with the help of remunicipalization. Municipalities can draw on the EU remunicipalization fund to be set up for this purpose. (See Chapter 1, "The money is there: Let's get the wealth back!")
? The Left Party wants to reform the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS 1) so that the quantity of certificates is limited to the EU's residual CO2 budget in order to achieve the Paris targets.
? Energy-intensive industry will receive free emission allowances for another ten years. That is too long! The free certificates must be reduced as quickly as possible - in return, the EU border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) must be adjusted accordingly. An active industrial policy is needed for the climate-neutral restructuring of industry, instead of unpaid extra profits through free certificates. (See chapter 2, "Restructuring industry fairly")
50|
Fighting energy poverty and energy cuts
The EU has decided to extend emissions trading to the heating and transport sectors (ETS-2). We reject this: instead, binding climate targets and emission limits must be set. Funding programs and state infrastructure programs must support the conversion in the sectors. We need a legally regulated framework in the heating and transport sectors for more social justice and a faster ecological transition.
? The Left Party is calling for more money for the Climate Social Fund to compensate for injustice caused by price increases. We reject the link to the ETS- 2.
? In Germany, we are calling for a climate money as a direct payment to support households with low and medium incomes.
? Electricity, gas, water and heating must not be cut off. We want to ban energy cuts that affect low-income households and introduce a low-cost basic quota for electricity, water and heating.
Socially just heat transition
The building sector is responsible for a large proportion of greenhouse gases in the EU. A heating transition is therefore urgently needed to achieve a climate-neutral heating supply by 2040: Buildings must be refurbished and heating systems converted. (See Chapter 1, "Socially just ecological modernization") This must be affordable and must not become an additional burden for tenants and homeowners on low and middle incomes!
? Investment offensive: 14 million fossil heating systems in Germany alone need to be replaced by heat pumps or local and district heating networks. To achieve this, production must be ramped up across Europe - in line with the common good and in accordance with high social, collective bargaining and ecological standards.
? ETS-2 makes gas heating systems a cost trap for consumers. We need support programs that are graduated according to income to ensure that low- and middle- income households do not incur any additional costs when replacing their heating system with a heat pump. For climate protection reasons, heating with natural gas, coal, oil and peat must be phased out across Europe. To this end, the EU must set binding requirements for the replacement of gas heating systems via the Ecodesign Directive, create planning security and set up a social financing program.
? Municipal utilities, municipal energy suppliers and cooperative initiatives must be supported in the development of heating networks through a massive funding program.
? In order to make heating prices independent of market fluctuations and speculation, we are calling for a profit ban in the heating sector. This means that the heat price must not be higher than the actual heat generation costs.
? There are a variety of solutions for the heating transition: Heat pumps for single- family homes, local and district heating networks in dense urban areas. For solutions at district and settlement level, instead of developing concepts house by house, we need mandatory municipal heat planning throughout the EU and a massive funding program!
? Hydrogen cannot provide a comprehensive solution in the heating sector - in this case, hydrogen is energetically inefficient and too expensive.
|51
The future is renewable
Conservative and liberal parties - driven by the fossil fuel lobby - are constantly trying to push through so-called technology neutrality in climate policy. What sounds good quickly turns out to be a strategy to slow down the energy transition and secure further profits for fossil fuel-exploiting corporations and outdated business models: be it for underground CO2 injection, e-fuels for cars or nuclear power. The Left is committed to a consistent energy transition towards renewable energy sources. No false technical solutions!
? No permanent structures for transitional solutions: No new, permanent infrastructure should be created for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas. We want to limit floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) to what is necessary for security of supply.
? We are calling for an EU-wide ban on fracking. LNG obtained through fracking must not be imported.
? For a Europe-wide phase-out of nuclear energy: For over 65 years, the EU has been promoting and spreading nuclear energy in Europe with billions in taxpayers' money through the Treaty on the European Atomic Energy Community (EU RATOM). Nuclear power is an uncontrollable risk technology that is fatal in the event of an accident and poses a massive threat to people and the environment for generations to come. EURATOM stands in the way of a Europe-wide energy transition and must therefore be dissolved.
? Investments in fossil fuels and nuclear power are not sustainable investments. We want to end the so-called taxonomy for nuclear power and gas. (See Chapter 1, "EU taxonomy and sustainable investments") Instead, public investments should be promoted for the transition to CO2-free production. (See Chapter 2, "Transforming industry in a fair way")
? Carbon capture and storage (CCS) - i.e. the extraction from the air, transportation and storage of carbon dioxide - is not a solution for climate protection. Storing CO2 underground is associated with high risks. We therefore want to ban CCS. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) - i.e. the material use of the extracted CO2 - must not lead to the energy transition being slowed down and fossil applications and production processes being operated for longer than necessary.
? Hydrogen can replace coal and natural gas where the direct use of green electricity is not possible. This applies to the decarbonization of the steel industry, parts of the chemical industry, in air and sea transport and for reconversion during dark doldrums.
? Hydrogen and its derivatives should only be obtained from green electricity. They may only be used where no more efficient alternatives are available.
? Where the electrolysis plants are publicly subsidized, they must be operated at least proportionately by the public sector.
? We reject the import and promotion of hydrogen from nuclear power or fossil sources. We want to limit the import of hydrogen from renewable energies to a necessary minimum. (See chapter 3, "Climate justice worldwide")
? We reject the promotion of technologies such as e-fuels (fuels produced using electrical energy). E-fuels can only be a niche solution: they are inefficient and expensive. And they lead to land use conflicts in the Global South at the expense of people and nature.
52|
? We want to convert existing natural gas grids and expand and operate new publicly owned hydrogen grids.
Adaptation to climate change
Measures to adapt to climate change are more expensive than prevention - both are necessary. The effects of global warming can also be felt in many places in Europe: we are experiencing more frequent devastating floods such as those in the Ahr valley, droughts and forest fires are on the increase. Even if global warming could be limited to 2 degrees, there will be more heavy rainfall, hot days, longer dry periods and a lower groundwater table. As global warming increases, we will have to rebuild our cities - the heat will become unbearable in summer. Urban heat islands are a danger to health and life. Drinking water shortages a r e becoming more frequent. This particularly affects people who work outdoors, children in playgrounds and the elderly. There are a variety of climate adaptation measures:
? Surfaces can be lightened in color, gravel gardens are prohibited. More shaded areas need to be created, especially with green plants and trees. We want to expand the greening of buildings and areas, as plants have a cooling effect.
? Air conduits can ensure the exchange of air between the city and the surrounding countryside.
? More areas are still being sealed than unsealed. Cold corridors are being destroyed, concrete deserts are making areas several degrees hotter. We must drive forward the unsealing of surfaces, cities in Europe must become sponge cities.
? Climate change is exacerbating distribution conflicts. When water becomes scarce, we have to decide: Do we want to use water for growing food and public swimming pools or for golf courses and private swimming pools? The left is on the side of the majority of people on these issues. We need a European water strategy based on the motto: the common good before profit interests and services of general interest before industry.
? The EU must support cities and municipalities in implementing climate adaptation measures - climate adaptation will become part of public provision. All cities and municipalities should be obliged to draw up heat action plans and heavy rain hazard maps. Water level measurement and flood monitoring should also cover small rivers, streams and brooks throughout Europe.
Climate justice worldwide
The countries of the Global South are particularly hard hit by climate and environmental destruction - and are the least responsible for it. Climate change can only be combated effectively if all countries make their fair contribution. The early industrialized countries have a special responsibility for a climate-neutral transition. The EU must phase out fossil fuels and production methods as quickly as possible in order to live up to this responsibility. Financial aid from the EU and the EIB must be significantly increased. For us, international solidarity also means providing technology for climate protection and adaptation free of charge.
? Highly indebted countries in the Global South are neither in a position to manage the transition to a climate-friendly economy, nor can they protect themselves from climate change.
|53
the consequences of global warming. The Left therefore supports the Debt for Climate campaign's call for a global debt cut for countries of the Global South.
? The Left is campaigning at EU level for reparation claims for climate-related damage to be recognized. We are committed to the swift and transparent implementation of the compensation fund for climate damage agreed at COP27. A fair distribution of the burden between the countries of the North and the South must be ensured.
? Women and children in particular suffer disproportionately from environmental damage and die more frequently in natural disasters. Without gender equality, there can be no climate justice. This must be taken into account in all climate protection measures and all measures must contribute to gender equality. (See Chapter 5, "A Union of Equality: Gender equality - Europe-wide")
? The EU should bring about or participate in international solidarity solutions for a population that is losing its previous living space due to climate change.
? We demand the extension of binding refugee rights to environmental and climate refugees. Nobody flees voluntarily! (See Chapter 5, "The limits of democracy: No Fortress Europe")
? Climate justice also means reducing the consumption of raw materials and resources and campaigning for a fair distribution of raw materials and resource consumption.
? We also want social and ecological standards along the supply chains for renewable energies (e.g. rare earths) and green hydrogen. (See chapter 2, "For the socio- ecological raw materials transition")
? If countries of the Global South refrain from cutting down their forests and polluting their oceans, as the countries of the Global North have done for centuries, then they must be compensated for this. The EU should advocate a global climate fund from which appropriate compensation payments are made.
? The EU should increasingly promote research and implementation measures that address the specific climate adaptation needs in the Global South (coastal protection, reef protection, measures against undermining, etc.).
More mobility with less traffic
The Left is fighting for everyone to be able to reach their destinations, for towns and villages to be better connected and for cities to become more liveable. Local and long- distance public transport throughout the EU must be expanded - this is the key to the transport revolution. A well-developed railroad with an integrated rail network can bring Europe closer together and would be a good alternative to flying.
Germany has allowed Deutsche Bahn to run into a huge investment backlog and discontinued night trains completely without necessity. This is worsening connections throughout Europe! We are committed to public transport that takes us all to our destinations barrier-free, comfortably and inexpensively, and is geared towards the common good and the needs of the people.
The EU has started to put climate protection on the agenda with the Fit for 55 package. But the focus is on increasing the CO2 price. The CO2 price will not have a sufficient steering effect: Rich people who fly in private jets or have a third-party car can affordto pay the CO2 price without having to change their behavior.
54|
change. The others are dependent on functioning alternatives in order to switch from the car. These often do not exist because they are not promoted enough. The price increases have an existential impact on these people.
Our left-wing transport revolution looks like this: We are expanding collective and climate-friendly means of transportation and ramping up the production of buses and trains. We are abolishing subsidies for climate-damaging air and car traffic: Far fewer cars will be needed in the future. We want to make city centers car-free - of course with exceptions for delivery traffic, emergency vehicles and people with limited mobility. We want to reduce freight traffic and shift the rest from road to rail. We will put an end to the luxury spectacle of the rich: We want to ban private jets and mega yachts throughout the EU.
Socialize traffic!
Socially and ecologically just transportation must be enforced against the automotive industry. Employees in the automotive industry deserve good prospects in an industry with a future, with good wages and jobs protected by collective agreements. The car companies are trying to replace combustion engines with even larger e-SUVs. That has no future. At the same time, there is a shortage of rails, wagons, suburban trains and buses on the global market.
? The interests of employees must be at the center of industrial restructuring! The transformation of the (automotive) industry is already threatening employees. Conversion strategies, a fair transition for employees and opportunities for retraining and career changes are needed.
? We must drive forward the social and ecological transformation of the automotive industry. Thousands of new (electric) buses and rail vehicles are needed for the mobility transition. The production of photovoltaic systems and heat pumps must also be ramped up.
? The establishment of (also publicly operated) production facilities for e-buses and rail vehicles must be supported by the EU.
? A Europe-wide expansion plan for transport infrastructure creates security. This will build capacity and create jobs.
? If there is state investment aid for corporations, it must be used to achieve public ownership, co-determination and better working conditions. If companies are rescued with state money, no dividends may be paid out.
? The necessary transformation on the ground must be shaped by transformation councils with the participation of employees and civil society: for a mobility industry with public ownership and under democratic control. (See Chapter 2, "Transforming industry fairly")
Expansion of local public transport in urban and rural areas
Our vision: Public transport is the basic means of transport for everyone, the main means of transport in cities and a realistic alternative in rural areas. Urban-rural connections are strengthened and geared towards the needs of commuters.
The towns and villages are also better connected with each other. Accessibility everywhere is a matter of course. Public transport will be linked with long-distance transport and cycle paths, creating an attractive offer for short and long distances.
Local public transport will gradually become free of charge throughout the EU, initially for people entitled to benefits, students, trainees and school pupils.
|55
? In order to implement this vision, a massive expansion of public transport is necessary throughout the EU. The "new European framework for urban mobility" is a step in the right direction to set binding expansion targets and create efficient, barrier-free and comfortable local transport - but the expansion must not be limited to urban centers.
Buses and trains in public hands! Our vision is the operation of local public transport by state-owned companies and local authorities. The EU is driving privatization with its tendering obligations. This must be stopped. Direct awarding of contracts must continue to be possible. Wherever local public transport has been privatized, we are committed to remunicipalization. Municipalities can access the municipalization fund for this purpose. (See Chapter 1, "The money is there: Let's get the wealth back!")
? We support the #Wirfahrenzusammen campaign of the trade union ver.di and Fridays for Future. The left is fighting together with employees and the climate justice movement throughout the EU for higher wages and better working conditions in public transport. This is the only way to expand public transport.
Right to mobility for all - reducing dependence on cars
In order to achieve the climate targets, car traffic must be drastically reduced by 2035. The key to this is to create affordable, climate-friendly alternatives and expand public transportation. This is our priority. It makes no sense to shake off the combustion engine - because even the automotive industry has understood that e-cars are the drive technology of the future. However, e-cars are only more climate-friendly if they are lightweight and the electricity comes from renewable energy sources.
? Most cars are far too big and heavy: we are calling for a two-ton limit on the weight of new cars. Of course, there are exceptions for families with several children or other specific needs, such as vans and camping vehicles.
? The automotive companies use the so-called super credits that they receive from the sale of e-cars to comply with the fleet limits: With the decision to phase out combustion engines, the super credits must also be discontinued.
? Transport should not be included in emissions trading (ETS 2.0). We also reject flat- rate pricing of CO2 in private transport. This affects those who are dependent on their cars and often have no alternative, and is therefore socially unjust. The social climate fund is far too small to cushion this: The money available should be used primarily for lower-income households that are dependent on their car.
? We reject the EU's push to expand the hydrogen infrastructure for private transport and to maintain all filling stations under the framing of "technological openness". This only serves the interests of the fossil fuel industry. We do not oppose the expansion o f	public e-charging stations, but we consider the expansion of public transport to be more important.
? In the long term, other settlement structures must be created: Instead of supermarkets on greenfield sites, we want town centers with lively centers away from metropolitan areas - this will reduce distances and (re)build communities.
56|
Right of way: train before plane
Aircraft are extremely harmful to the climate: flying must therefore be drastically reduced in order to achieve climate targets. E-fuels are energy and cost-intensive and are not an alternative to flying less.
Traveling to other European countries by train is sometimes a challenge: different booking portals, no passenger rights and many things are expensive. There are far too few night trains. We want to create a European company that ensures better cooperation between national rail companies, organizes better networking in passenger and freight transport and promotes cross-border rail projects - our vision is the United Railways of Europe! Then there would be a joint booking platform, coordinated timetables and a massive expansion of cross-border transport: with the United Railways of Europe, a European train can be introduced by 2035, with connections every hour between the European capitals and major cities. We will then be able to travel to Marseille by night train and to Barcelona without changing trains - affordably and without cash. A significant proportion of air traffic would be shifted to rail.
? Short-haul flights for train journeys of less than six hours will no longer be necessary; we want to ban them.
? We want to abolish climate-damaging subsidies for air travel. At the same time, we want to make rail tickets cheaper with public subsidies.
? We are setting limits to the climate-damaging luxury consumption of the rich: we want to ban private jets throughout the EU - and air cabs too! Instead of introducing higher prices across the board by including flights in the EU emissions trading system, we are levying an additional tax on first and business class flights, as these are particularly CO2-intensive per person.
? Instead of new highways and airports, we need an EU-wide plan for the conversion and alternative use of fossil fuel-based transport infrastructure. Funding for roads and airports as part of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) must be ended. The funds freed up will be used to expand the railroads.
? We want to put an immediate end to the expansion of further flight capacities. One way to start reorganizing the airport system is to close down loss-making regional airports. In order to implement the dismantling of the aviation industry and infrastructure in a socially just way, measures are needed for a just transition for employees, as in the automotive industry, under the motto: from flight attendant to train attendant.
? An attractive railroad is a prerequisite for the mobility turnaround: This can only be achieved in public hands and without competition. With the United Railways of Europe, Europe's rail companies are working together instead of against each other
- for example, they can set up a joint wagon pool for night trains. This saves costs and creates planning security. The EU must not push ahead with the separation of rail operations and infrastructure. Direct awards to rail companies should be given priority. When an operator changes, the employees must be taken on.
? For rail in the countryside! The expansion of the European networks must not be limited to the high-speed connections between the major cities. The TEN-T rail network, the European transport infrastructure plan, must be implemented quickly - with a focus on less profitable cross-border traffic.

Freight traffic
International corporations play off the lowest labor costs against each other globally and take advantage of the low transport costs. As a result, more and more transport kilometers are being put into the products. The absurdity of global freight transport must be ended: North Sea crabs, which are poached in Morocco and packed in Poland to be sold as a regional product in the North Sea, are not a real product.
"North Sea crabs". We want to reduce freight traffic overall and shift a significant proportion of the remaining freight traffic to rail:
? Regional production chains and regional marketing make a significant contribution to reducing truck and sea traffic, which is another reason why we want to strengthen regional economic cycles. (See Chapter 2, "Strengthening regional economic cycles")
? Higher transport costs are an important means of reducing transport routes. The mandatory implementation and increase of the truck toll in all member states can ensure that higher distances are also priced higher. This will give rail freight transport considerable cost advantages over truck transport. As in Switzerland, the revenue from the HGV toll should be used to promote freight transport.
? Although there has been progress in the social regulations for HGVs, such as the right to return home, they are still inadequate. The social regulations for truck drivers need to be further improved and checks extended. They finally need higher wages! This will also help to reduce transport routes.
? The European rail transport network must be implemented. Further technical and legal harmonization of EU rail transport is a prerequisite for a switch to rail in the EU: the EU must ensure that the 740-metre network for freight transport is actually expanded throughout Europe by 2030.
? Large industrial and commercial areas should be required to provide an appropriate rail connection.
? In order to relieve cities of delivery traffic, we want to support municipalities in setting up local logistics centers with good working conditions. We want to promote public parcel and delivery services that are geared towards the common good, instead of banal hypercompetition at the expense of employees.
Shipping and maritime transport
The EU is driving forward the decarbonization of maritime transport through e-fuels. There are hardly any alternatives. But e-fuels are expensive and energy-intensive - which is why maritime transport must be reduced. The EU must set binding targets for this. A regionalization of economic structures significantly reduces global traffic with container ships. Emissions from cruise ships and container ships are also too high.
? We want to prohibit flags of convenience in European maritime transport and consistently tie national jurisdiction to the principle of who ultimately benefits from the profits ("final beneficiary"). Support for shipping must be linked to social and environmental conditions.
? Scrapping in unlicensed ports of convenience is prohibited. The ban must not be circumvented by selling. Design specifications in shipbuilding must be developed that are recycling-friendly from the outset. Competition between European ports must be replaced by close cooperation.
58|
? Wherever possible, ships must be powered by electricity: near the coast, in inland shipping and on short journeys. Container ships and cruise ships must use shore power in European ports.
? We want to ban private motorized superyachts with a length of more than 60 meters throughout the EU. It is a scandal that they are to be exempt from EU emissions trading as leisure craft.
? Emissions from cruise ships are too high - regional tourism must be strengthened and cruises must be reduced.
? We want the tonnage tax to be abolished throughout Europe as a special tax regime for shipping companies. Instead, these companies should be subject to regular profit taxation in order to ensure equal treatment in the tax system.
Space
The development of near-Earth space has many important functions: for telecommunications, for observing climate change, for research. The use and development of space must be carried out under public control.
? No space fun for the super-rich at the expense of our climate! We want to ban private space travel and space tourism from EU soil.
? In order to avoid space debris, the EU must work with the international community to develop and implement binding guidelines on the deployment and operation of satellites.
Sustainable digitalization
Digital applications and devices consume a lot of electricity. Many raw materials are needed to manufacture them, most of which are produced in countries in the Global South under exploitative, environmentally damaging conditions and with disregard for the labor rights of employees. This also applies to the manufacture of the appliances themselves.
Human rights, employee rights and environmental and climate protection requirements must be observed worldwide. Digitalization will increase the demand for electricity.
Additional wind turbines and solar fields will be needed to generate electricity ecologically. Their production also requires raw materials and energy, and their operation consumes land. Up to now, efficiency gains in appliances have always been overcompensated by additional new appliances and applications (rebound effect). We therefore need a serious debate about the areas in which digitalization improves people's lives and our future, and those in which it does not: so that digitalization benefits people and not profit.
? Stop energy-guzzling advertising, tracking and data collection in the service of consumption and opinion manipulation.
? We want to reduce the energy consumption of digital applications: through targeted research, data economy and mandatory energy-saving standard settings. Superfluous and extremely energy-intensive applications such as the
We want to prevent the "mining" of cryptocurrencies.
? Waste heat from data centers must be reused, for example fed into heating networks. This must be taken into account from the outset when planning the location and cooling technology (water cooling).
|59
? Durability, easy repairability, reusability through modular design, minimum update obligations, good availability of spare parts and far-reaching interoperability of software and hardware must be made mandatory. We want to increase warranty obligations to at least five years, extend depreciation periods and increase the minimum useful life of procured communication technology in public institutions. If manufacturers discontinue support and no longer provide security updates, the source code and assembly instructions must be published so that repair centers, developers and hobbyists can extend the life of the devices. (See Chapter 2, "More circular economy, less waste")
? The Supply Chain Act must be tightened and manufacturers must be held liable for compliance with social, environmental and occupational health and safety standards along the entire supply chain. (See Chapter 4, "Fair trade policy: cooperation instead of competition", and Chapter 1, "Redistribution for good work")
? Finite raw materials and rare earths required for the energy transition and the digital economy must be replaced by ecologically less harmful raw materials wherever possible and research into this must be strongly promoted. Lithium, for example, must be replaced by sodium in rechargeable batteries.
Fight species extinction!
The compulsion to operate for the greatest profit is undermining our natural livelihoods. Germany is one of the regions with the highest water loss in the EU. The extinction of species continues unabated. Forests, moors and seas are on the verge of collapse.
? Funding for the protection of biodiversity has been increased in the EU. However, the EU has fallen well short of the nature conservation targets it set itself. In the interests of the agricultural lobby, the conservative and extreme right-wing parties in the EU Parliament are trying to prevent an effective renaturation law that would restore destroyed ecosystems and biodiversity.
? Daring more wilderness: We want to preserve our natural resources and restore destroyed ecosystems: clean, pollutant-free water, soil and air and growing biodiversity. Only an intact natural environment can secure life for us humans.
? Wild animals and their habitats must be given special protection. International species and nature conservation agreements, in particular the current Kunming- Montreal Agreement, must be consistently implemented in the EU.
? We want to expand protected areas such as Natura 2000 and wilderness areas. Protection must be carried out under strict control and in compliance with the Habitats Directive (FFH).
? The EU Water Framework Directive for good ecological water status and its daughter directives must not be watered down or opened up.
? The EU directives must also be complied with: There is a need for consistent infringement proceedings in the event of failures.
? We want to further increase the EU LIFE program, as it has proven to be effective in improving the state of nature and the environment.
? We support a new EU nature conservation fund to finance the tasks (for example the rewetting of moors) from the so-called Nature Restoration Law. We reject the financing of nature conservation through compensation measures for biodiversity loss or other nature finance markets.
60|
? Human rights must be respected, there must be no theft of indigenous land by nature parks.
? Nature is often only perceived as an object of environmental protection. A different relationship to nature should also be reflected in the law. The Left supports the proposal to recognize nature as a legal subject and to include the criminal offence of ecocide in European and international law. Nature then has rights that can be enforced.
? There is a need for an effective right of action for environmental and animal welfare associations in the EU Member States.
Protecting the oceans
The world's oceans make up around 73 percent of our planet. They provide a habitat for animals and plants, are a source of food, regulate the climate and produce oxygen. But this habitat continues to be destroyed. Every year, 8 million tons of waste end up in the oceans. Oil and gas extraction is poisoning the water, while overfishing and global warming are destroying habitats.
? Since March 2023, there has been a UN Convention on the Protection of the High Seas, which makes it possible to place high seas under protection. The EU must push for rapid ratification of the agreement and work to ensure that 30 percent of the world's marine areas are placed under protection by 2030. The access and fishing rights of small-scale fishermen must be guaranteed and their involvement in the management of protected areas must be guaranteed and promoted.
? The EU must enforce the protection of marine biotopes through binding standards and tough sanctions. Affected regions and employees should be supported in shaping structural change. Fisheries subsidies must be linked to sustainable, social and animal welfare standards.
? We want fishing to be effectively regulated so that no more fish are caught than can grow back. The livelihoods and working conditions of people in and outside the EU, on ships and in fishing areas should be safeguarded.
? We want to ban fishing with gillnets and trawls and support fishermen in using alternative fishing methods.
? The pollution control regulations for watercraft and infrastructure projects must be tightened. Support is required for the technical conversion of the fishing companies based and operating in the region.
? The pollution of the oceans by waste disposal, agricultural and industrial substances must be drastically reduced. The MARPOL Convention is a basis for this. Violations must be punished more effectively.
? Munitions in the EU's seas pose an acute threat to the marine environment and human health. The salvage and disposal of munitions must therefore be driven forward with the help of new technologies.
? Only sustainable aquacultures should be promoted. Animal husbandry in water must also be regulated socially, ecologically and in terms of animal welfare. Strict guidelines and controls are needed to ensure that fragile ecosystems are not further destroyed.
? Commercial whaling must be stopped. The EU should exert influence on countries such as Norway, Iceland and Japan to end the hunting of whales. Violations of the international ban on whaling must be punished.
? We want to ban deep sea mining internationally.
|61
? More plastic than fish in the sea? We must prevent this! The use of plastic must be drastically reduced. The creation of microplastics must be avoided wherever possible. (See chapter 2, "More circular economy, less waste")
Protect animals
The Left stands for a fundamental change in the coexistence of humans and animals. We do not want animals to be seen as things and not as a means to profit. Several successful European citizens' initiatives show this: The European population finally wants real animal protection. Animals are sentient beings and we must treat them as such. The Left is also committed to consistent animal and species protection at European level. Animal welfare must be enforced independently of profit interests: From agriculture (see Chapter 2, "For socio-ecological agriculture") to research laboratories. We want animal welfare to become an EU common goal. This is important so that poor communities can receive funding. The rights of animals should be enshrined in a future European constitution.
? We need higher standards without loopholes, more transparency in the animal industry and independent inspections by appropriate personnel and video documentation in slaughterhouses.
? We want to ban animal testing in the EU and promote and give legal preference to alternative research methods. Clear phase-out plans are finally needed in all Member States.
? The trade in animals (especially on the internet) must be strictly regulated. Poaching and illegal wildlife trade must be combated. We want a ban on the production and import of fur.
? We protect wild animals by connecting biotopes. We reduce wildlife accidents through animal corri- dors: Fences along highways and speed limits help here, for example.
? The husbandry standards in zoos, businesses and households must be adapted to the basic needs of the respective animals. Social animals should only be kept individually in exceptional cases. We demand an immediate ban on dolphinaria, wild animals in circuses and a ban on keeping animals at fairgrounds and similar places.
? The EU must develop a positive list for keeping pets. This should protect exotic animals from being taken from the wild. It should also ensure that only animals whose basic needs can be met and which do not pose a risk to the population (diseases, predators) are kept privately.
? We are fighting for a ban on the import of animals. Exceptions only apply to animals that are demonstrably better protected in zoos and aquariums than in the wild. Animals caught in the wild must not be sold in zoo pet shops.
? The European nature conservation directives must be reformed so that recreational hunting is limited. We want to prohibit the hunting of dogs and cats as well as predators such as foxes.
? No patents may be registered on plants, animals, humans and other living beings or on their organs, genes, gene sequences or breeding methods.

Chapter 4 Peace and social justice worldwide
We are experiencing an epochal change. The conflict for dominance in the world is coming to a head. Increased competition on the world market is fueling conflicts over markets and resources everywhere. The slow end of the USA's supremacy and the rise of China are leading to imperial tensions and new proxy conflicts everywhere. Added to this is Russia's striving for great power status. NATO members and other countries such as China, India and Russia are massively arming themselves. Arms companies are the main beneficiaries of this. Capitalism, which is based on profit maximization, carries war within it like a cloud carries rain.
Reactionary movements are on the rise in many places. The threat of authoritarianism is also real in Europe. The dangers of a world war and t h e fear of nuclear escalation have not been as great as they are today for 70 years. This makes it clear that a multipolar world needs international negotiation formats and a new policy of security and détente. However, the EU all too often contributes to escalation and is part of the power struggle between major powers that are in fierce competition with each other.
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has declared that
"we" are entering an "era of regional rivalries and great powers that are rebalancing their relationship with each other". This is why she wants to turn the EU into a player in the global struggle for hegemony. In doing so, she is representative of governments and leading capital factions in the EU that are geared towards economic and military confrontation. The EU's trade strategies in the Indo-Pacific and Africa are evidence of its efforts to secure economic spheres of influence and sales markets. In recent years alone, armaments spending by European NATO member states has increased from 235 billion euros in 2015 to 310 billion euros in 2022. The European Defense Fund, created in 2017, is intended to pave the way for a European army. It is to be endowed with billions. The "strategic compass", which was adopted at the EU summit in March 2022, sets out armaments policy guidelines to position the EU as a central imperial player in times of a "return of power politics". This version of a
"strategic autonomy" benefits not least the European arms companies and drives Europe further into bloc confrontation and arms races.
Various instruments have been expanded or newly created for this purpose: The European Peace Facility has become an important pot for financing arms deliveries. Its budget has been increased from 5.7 billion euros to - provisionally - 12 billion euros. In addition, the EU Parliament's decision in September 2023 to promote
"Instrument for strengthening the European Defense Industry through Joint Procurement" (EDIRPA), the transnational purchase of armaments with an initial 300 million euros from the EU budget. Europe as a civilian power has thus come a long way: The research and development of armaments, the purchase and production, everything is now co-financed by the EU budget. The current war is a huge business for the arms industry.
The left, on the other hand, is committed to de-escalation, global justice and civil conflict resolution in order to provide a peaceful alternative to the escalating confrontation between the blocs. This means a policy that does not follow the logic of the military, that takes the threat to democracy and the rule of law from within and without seriously, but is committed to cross-border reconciliation, disarmament and social justice. A policy of détente that strengthens international law and the path of diplomacy and negotiation. A policy that finally tackles the causes of flight - not the refugees.
|63
ted. That strengthens solidarity-based trade and joint development instead of intensifying competition between locations and neo-colonial exploitation. That supports those people, organizations, trade unions and movements that stand up for democracy and justice instead of continuing to make deals with dictators. Ensuring that the EU does not remain a driver of the arms race, but becomes a union of peace.
This can be achieved with a new internationalism that respects international law and human rights without double standards - and stands up for justice, cooperation and democracy everywhere. For us, internationalism means solidarity with people, movements, trade unions, organizations, parties and governments that are committed to an independent path of development beyond the capitalist logic of profit and against imperialist hegemony. Because Rosa Luxemburg's alternative
"Socialism or barbarism" is becoming increasingly topical. As an internationalist party, the left is part of the global movement for a peaceful and just world, against imperialism and war, against fascism and racism, against exploitation, oppression, poverty and environmental destruction. The boundaries are drawn between above and below, our fight for justice is universal. Social justice, a climate-friendly economy and the rule of law, human rights and effective international structures are needed worldwide. We are therefore fighting for an EU that is neither a pawn nor an imperial player in the new world (dis)order. For an EU that is strategically independent of the arms race and the bloc confrontation between the USA on the one hand and China and Russia on the other.
An EU committed to peace and global justice.
We see ourselves as an active part of the peace movement. We want to strengthen and build the peace movement. Together with activists, movements and trade unionists, we want to exert pressure for a policy that puts people at the center. That is why we refuse to divide the world into spheres of influence of major powers. That is why we want to break with the EU's policy of military tunnel vision and advocate civilian alternatives worldwide. That is why we reject arms exports and the business of weapons, destruction and death. That is why we oppose great power politics and imperial domination everywhere.
That is why we believe that security and social justice belong together. That is why international law and the Charter of the United Nations form the framework of international relations for us. That is why we stand up for the fact that war must not be a means of politics. That is why Die Linke is the party of peace.
Against the Russian war of aggression - for peace in Ukraine
We condemn the Russian Federation's criminal war of aggression. We condemn the war crimes and call for those responsible to be punished.
We should not forget that Putin's war of aggression also h a s a history in which the West exacerbated the crisis with NATO's eastward expansion. Our solidarity is with the people of Ukraine and all those who are suffering, resisting or fleeing the war. And it belongs to all those in the region who oppose the war, refuse to do military service or desert and are persecuted for it. It belongs to those who oppose war worldwide and support people on the run. We feel connected to them. We emphasize the human right to conscientious objection and the right to asylum for all conscientious objectors and deserters. It is indivisible and applies to everyone, whether in Russia or Ukraine. The war against Ukraine must end immediately and Russian troops must be withdrawn from Ukraine. Who is being attacked,
64|
has the right of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine must be restored within secure borders. Legitimate security interests of Ukraine and Russia as well as the rights of national minorities must be adequately taken into account. It is clear that we need more than appeals. Putin's imperialist aggression must be stopped.
At the same time, the West must not continue to react with escalation and rearmament to the fact that the global dominance of the leading power, the USA, is declining. We stand for a policy that defends democracy, peace and international law by civilian means and promotes alternatives to military logic. We call for a rapid ceasefire without preconditions to pave the way for serious peace negotiations.
Instead of supplying more and more weapons to a war of attrition that has been going on for far too long and accepting the risk of further escalation, the non-military options must finally be fully utilized. We are committed to strengthening the anti-war movement with the aggressor Russia, in Ukraine and worldwide.
? The German government and the EU must finally make every effort and - even against the will of the USA - take up the initiatives of numerous countries such as China, India and Brazil and exert diplomatic pressure on Russia. Arms freeze negotiations at the invitation of the UN and the consideration of existing negotiation initiatives are necessary, even if these are not yet sufficient.
? Targeted sanctions must be directed against Putin's power apparatus, the oligarchs and the military-industrial complex and thus against the ability to wage war. Sanctions must have clearly defined goals and end when these have been achieved. We reject sanctions that are primarily directed against the population or contribute to impoverishment in the Global South.
? The German government and the EU must fulfill their responsibility for the expropriation of Russian oligarchs' assets within a national and European framework. A transparency law that makes it more difficult to conceal assets is urgently needed. The establishment of an international financial register, as called for by Thomas Piketty, is necessary and overdue. A central, transparent real estate register is also needed.
? The Left is in favor of sanctions against the Russian nuclear sector.
? Resistance against militarism and nationalism everywhere!
? Support the resistance in Russia against war and dictatorship!
? Conscientious objectors and deserters from both warring parties must be granted the right to asylum and recognized without bureaucracy.
? We demand a debt haircut for Ukraine to enable reconstruction after the war. The sell-out of the country to Western corporations and Ukraine's dependence on lenders and financial investors such as Blackrock must be stopped.
? Russia is more than Putin! We stand up against propaganda against Russians and Russian-speaking people in this country and support progressive forces in Russia.
? Eastern Europe today consists of a large number of independent states that have the right to make sovereign decisions about their development. We want to maintain civil society relations in all of these countries in order to oppose growing nationalism.
|65
? Refugees must be accepted more quickly and with less bureaucracy, regardless of their origin. The fact that this is possible can be seen in the way refugees from Ukraine are treated. This approach must apply to all refugees.
? The Asylum Seekers Benefits Act must be abolished. Refugees' arrival should be made easier by quickly providing them with decentralized accommodation. (See Chapter 5, "The borders of democracy: No Fortress Europe")
Collective security in Europe instead of an arms race and bloc confrontation
Military alliances such as NATO claim to create more "security" for their members by pooling the potential for force. However, the agreements on armament in particular create more insecurity and lead to a security dilemma: other countries are also increasing their armaments budgets. Instead of putting money into social policy, billions go to arms companies.
While NATO is often referred to as a defense alliance, the balance sheet looks different. From the Kosovo war to Iraq and the "War on Terror": short-term profit interests in trade policy and the imperial ambitions of NATO and its allies have often triumphed in the West. Even today, NATO states such as Turkey or the USA and its allies such as Saudi Arabia systematically disregard international law and human rights. NATO is not a "community of values".
The German government's new security strategy and corresponding EU concepts also remain committed to the priority of "military security" and subordination to NATO. However, military armament only appears to create more security; in fact, it increases the risk of violent confrontation. Some EU states are now even contributing their armed forces to the escalation between the USA and China. That is extremely dangerous. We want to get out of this spiral. Because almost every country in the world is arming itself
- and there is no end in sight.
In the wake of the Russian attack on Ukraine, the coalition government with the support of the CDU and the AfD opposition has decided on a special fund for the federal budget of over 100 billion euros. This means that Germany intends to exceed NATO's target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on military and armaments overnight. Rearmament is given constitutional status - against the peace requirement of the Basic L a w .	A far greater increase in the armaments budget is planned. Added to this are the rearmament and militarization of the EU.
The current financial framework provides for a total of up to 46 billion euros in public investment for armaments and military-related research projects. The version of "strategic autonomy" being pursued by the EU Commission and the German government is primarily intended to give the EU the opportunity to act militarily on a global scale. The "turning point" towards a new arms race means that resources are being shifted from the fight for climate protection, better education, development cooperation and social security to (even) more military. This policy is driving a spiral of armament that in no way creates more security in Europe. This is because the military in the EU is not underfunded. The military expenditure of the EU states is already many times higher than that of Russia. We are fighting for an EU that is strategically independent but stands up for peace, negotiations and disarmament. We therefore want a security strategy for Europe that creates sustainable security without further escalation and without driving the arms race, and which at the same time opens up prospects for disarmament and de-escalation on an international level.
66|
? Stop rearmament and no military deployments abroad, instead mutual security, disarmament, structural non-aggression capability and the restructuring of the armed forces on the basis of strict defensive potentials. The huge loopholes in the EU arms export directives must be closed and sanctions created for violations. The Bundeswehr must be withdrawn from all foreign deployments. It must not be deployed domestically beyond necessary disaster relief. The emergency laws that provide for and enable the deployment of the Bundeswehr within Germany must be repealed.
? Stop the militarization of the EU! No EU army and dissolution of the EU battle groups as well as the "Defense Agency" and the EU Defense Fund. We want to reallocate the planned armaments budgets EVF, EFF and the expenditure for "military mobility" and PESCO to investments for socio-ecological restructuring and energy independence.
? The principle of a parliamentary army must not be watered down; the Bundestag must continue to decide on Bundeswehr deployments.
? We will not agree to any changes to the EU treaties that include steps t o w a r d s further militarization of the EU.
? The EU treaties must be amended: The armament obligation for the member states writes militarization into the foundations of the EU. It must be overcome.
? We want to disarm the armed forces in Europe. We need conventional arms control in Europe along the lines of the A-CFE Treaty (Adapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe).
? The EU must not be part of confrontation and escalation! Therefore, unnecessary provocations such as the large-scale "Air Defender" maneuver or a permanent stationing of German combat troops on the Russian border must be avoided.
? Even if it is currently difficult to imagine due to the Russian war of aggression: in the long term, we need the prospect of a collective security system in Europe. To this end, we want to revive the OSCE and develop it further as OSCE 2.0 into the central structure for a sustainable peace and security order.
? We want a Europe without weapons of mass destruction. The EU must accede to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and advocate a relaunch of the treaty on the disarmament and destruction of medium and short-range missiles throughout Europe. Negotiations between NATO and Russia on the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons from the Atlantic to the Urals are urgently needed. The goal must be the elimination of all nuclear weapons.
? We want to close the US military bases in the EU, as these are deployment sites for the bloc confrontation and are used for wars that violate international law, targeted killings through drone attacks, extralegal detention, the stationing and storage of nuclear weapons and intelligence surveillance worldwide.
? No security without social security! No fake news campaign has contributed as much to the destabilization of the EU as the years of cutbacks driven by various federal governments. Instead of a new edition of austerity policy, a stable Europe needs massive public investment in social welfare, education, health and climate-friendly restructuring.
? The EU must strengthen civil conflict resolution capacities, international civil protection and development cooperation. We want to establish a civilian European peace service and develop civilian structures for international disaster protection. We reject civil-military cooperation - civil aid must not be linked to military measures.
|67
No business with death and destruction! Stop arms exports
Wars are waged with weapons and cause millions of people to suffer, but many arms companies and their shareholders make a fortune from them. They have an interest in growing profits and no interest in a quick end to violence. In order to be a credible international player, the EU relies on strong domestic arms industries in the EU member states. This is not possible without extensive arms exports. But a society in which the business of death grows is not peaceful. In contrast, we stand for a different perspective: instead of more and more weapons, we want an economy that produces useful goods for people and uses its resources to solve common challenges.
? We reject the business of death. We do not want to supply weapons and armaments to crisis and war zones. Because every weapon finds its war, some even several. The Left therefore calls for a legal ban on arms exports. Until this is achieved, arms exports must no longer be supported with taxpayers' money and Hermes guarantees.
? We do not want to further expand the military-industrial complex in Europe, but rather dismantle it and convert it to socially useful production. Reconversion is feasible: Together with social partners from trade unions, the peace movement and churches, we want to develop conversion programs for and with employees in the arms industry in order to create new, civilian jobs.
? We advocate outlawing the development, production and use of fully autonomous weapons. The German government must launch an international initiative to this end.
? We reject the development of an armed Eurodrone, as well as the Future Combat Air System and similar joint armaments projects. The EU must take a first step and campaign internationally for a ban on armed drones that is binding under international law.
? We call for an EU-wide ban on the export of biological or chemical dual-use goods to countries that have not signed and ratified the respective convention banning biological or chemical weapons.
? Investing in the future instead of profits for arms companies! Major tasks lie ahead of us in the CO2-neutral restructuring of our economy. We want to mobilize the necessary investments for this and reallocate military spending.
Good neighborliness: defending human rights
Neighborhood and enlargement policy is often reduced by the EU Commission to short- term and narrow-minded energy and migration policy "solutions". At the same time, a peaceful, cooperative and comprehensive neighborhood policy, which includes growing economic cooperation, rule of law discourse and cultural exchange, is part of the EU's declared self-image. The Left stands for a neighborhood policy that promotes cooperation, mutually beneficial economic cooperation, the protection of human rights, intercultural dialogue and democratic development. While the German government and the EU Commission like to talk about human rights and feminist foreign policy, the reality is completely different. The military and police are increasingly merging, especially at the EU's external borders guarded by Frontex. The militarization of the EU's external borders and the military "support" of third countries to push forward European borders for the purpose of migration control are brutal, inhumane and a massive violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This destabilizes s o c i e t i e s . Cooperation with authoritarian states to seal off the EU from refugees
68|
itself creates new uncertainties. This also harms democracy in Europe - no democracy can develop in a fortress. Isolation has itself become a big business, with surveillance and "security technology" generating huge profits. The dependence of Europe's energy supply on fossil dictatorships (formerly Russia, now Qatar) is also damaging the global climate, our democracy here and the people on the ground. In addition, the EU is exporting cutbacks and privatization policies to its neighbors via accession and association agreements and its trade policy. This must change.
? Stop the dying - Europe's borders must be demilitarized! We reject drone missions, barbed wire, pushbacks, walls and other measures to seal off refugees. (See chapter 5, "Saving people: legal escape routes")
? Support for and cooperation with NATO countries and their allies that disregard international law - such as Turkey under the regime of Recep Tayyip Erdogan or Saudi Arabia in the brutal war in Yemen - must be stopped immediately.
? We call on the EU to realign its relationship with NATO member and privileged EU partner Turkey. The accession process is no longer being pursued by President Erdogan. The EU is bound to the AKP regime by the European Council's refugee deal and regularly turns a blind eye to the Turkish government's domestic and foreign policy repressions and its geopolitical intervention in the South Caucasus.
? We call for an end to participation in international police and secret service operations or training missions that serve to support authoritarian regimes, such as in Egypt, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Libya or Morocco.
? We reject the fact that authoritarian governments criminalize opposition movements and organizations and that the EU follows this criminalization for opportunistic reasons. The PKK must finally be removed from the EU's "terror list".
? We demand that the use of military security and mercenary companies be banned in the EU.
? Massive investments in renewable energies are needed throughout Europe and the EU's neighboring countries from North Africa to Asia! This will help democracies and their economies to become independent of fossil dictatorships in the long term.
? We want to promote civil society instead of making deals with dictators and warlords to seal off refugees! That is why we support progressive movements and civil society from Kurdistan to Sudan and the Western Sahara.
? A sustainable peace order and collective security require a stable economic foundation. What is therefore needed is a neighborhood and trade policy based on solidarity that invests locally and is tied to compliance with democratic, social and legal standards.
? Link EU enlargement to social and democratic standards! EU membership must be linked to social, constitutional and democratic development indicators on the ground and must neither be a political bargaining chip for the geostrategic interests of NATO and the USA nor be linked to cutbacks and privatization requirements.
? The EU has lost its compass in its enlargement policy: in terms of overall social development, in particular the promotion of rule of law processes in
|69
the candidate countries, the fight against climate change and for social participation. Instead, a politically instrumental, purely economic interest in cooperation with these neighboring states of the EU is being pursued.
? Regimes such as Azerbaijan must no longer be supported as long as they destabilize an entire region and act belligerently, repressively and in violation of international law towards their own and the Armenian population. In this context, the EU must also oppose Turkey's policy in Azerbaijan.
? The Left will campaign against an enlargement policy that is exclusively economically motivated and interest-driven, which ultimately seals off the European single market.
Democratization and rule of law discourses should be co-determined by NGOs and civil societies, by the critical opposition in the candidate countries. Media freedom, education and participation in the European public sphere in the neighboring states and candidate countries must be comprehensively supported by European funding programs.
Strengthening international law - resolving conflicts civilly and peacefully
International law and the UN Charter are the framework for resolving conflicts peacefully. There must be no double standards in international law - on the contrary: we need more international cooperation between states and cross-border rights for people. We therefore want to strengthen international law and punish violations everywhere.
? We want to enforce human rights globally. To achieve this, international jurisdiction must be strengthened and double standards overcome. States such as the USA and Russia must also be held accountable.
? International and human rights conventions also apply to the EU and its allies! We clearly reject the debate on the supply of banned weapons in exceptional cases (such as cluster munitions). No end justifies these means!
? The EU must campaign for the release of political prisoners everywhere. We stand in solidarity with persecuted whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and journalists like Julian Assange, who have made war crimes and unlawful US surveillance public.
? We demand that the human right to conscientious objection be respected in all states.
? The EU must focus on civilian peace measures such as the involvement of women's initiatives, training programs, the collection of firearms and civilian mediators. The funds made available for the civil peace service must be systematically increased.
? Internationally proven instruments such as unarmed civilian peacekeeping must be promoted.
A different approach to security: strengthening the United Nations ...
The left fights for a peaceful EU that does not take part in the competition between the military poles, but plays a balancing role. Multilateralism means the cooperative and equal cooperation of several states to solve common problems. A multipolar world order requires containment through multilateral structures.
70|
At the end of the bloc confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, there would have been an opportunity to clear the way for a collective security alliance that would not lead to insecurity for others. This opportunity was missed. Developments since then do not show that this path was impossible, but that it would have been necessary. Instead, the expansion of NATO has stoked international tensions.
The challenge remains to create a global peace order that encompasses as many states as possible. This is another reason why we need an end to Russian a g g r e s s i o n and a just peace in Ukraine. Lasting peace in a crisis-ridden world can only be achieved through disarmament and de-escalation. Instead of arms races, we need stronger cooperation for new security and disarmament treaties and a just world economic order. Our goal is to overcome all military alliances (such as NATO, CSTO, AUCUS in the South Pacific region) through a process towards a global peace order. The multipolar world order with its various imperial centers of power needs a new peace order that focuses on international law and the organizations of international law.
The United Nations (UN) system encompasses almost all states in the world and is the accepted framework for overcoming the security dilemma. The UN Charter enshrines the equality of nations, their sovereignty, the prohibition of aggressive war and the principle of peace. This includes the ban on intervention, which has also been repeatedly circumvented by NATO states.
For Die Linke, the UN represents the starting point for the states of the EU to organize a common civil foreign policy in practice and to create global security. We do not reduce security to the military and violence, but look at the underlying causes of insecurity: A lack of social security often results from economic interests. Power between the Global North and the South is also unequally distributed in the UN system. Nevertheless, the institutions and sub-organizations of the UN are more inclusive and transparent than all informal associations of powerful states such as the G20 or the G7. To this day, institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank play an important role in the development of global economic and trade policy. For decades, they have acted as levers for privatization and cutbacks. In contrast, we want to strengthen the UN and its corresponding international institutions and turn them into forums for social development.
? We want to upgrade the UN and make it the international place where hostile states can enter into low-threshold dialog. There can only be a policy of détente among those who have conflicts with each other.
? A global disarmament initiative must be launched via the UN in which binding disarmament targets are set for all member states.
? We want to achieve a balance of economic interests in the North-South relationship. The sub-organizations of the UN have considerable knowledge that must be used for the development of a fair world trade policy.
? We want to bring more global trade issues into the UN. In this way, they can be appropriately linked with social, development and environmental policy goals - and the UN Sustainable Development Goals can be brought to life.
? We call for a fourth Financing for Development Conference under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to address structural problems of economic policy in financial regulation, debt, taxation, trade and technology.
|71
... and democratize!
We advocate a democratic reform of the UN, as this is the only way to strengthen it in the long term. The UN is also in urgent need of change. The UN Security Council is often blocked due to conflicts between the major powers. The five permanent members also have such a privileged role in the UN system that they can de facto break the UN Charter time and again. This was the case for the USA in Iraq as it is today for Russia in Ukraine. As a union of 27 states, the EU has just as many votes in the General Assembly, and this weight must finally be used together with other states.
? The UN General Assembly must be strengthened vis-à-vis the Security Council and be given the right to overrule a veto by a Security Council member with a qualified majority. We reject the demand for a permanent seat for Germany on the Security Council.
? The countries of the Global South must be given a greater say and allowed to play a more active role in tackling the world's most pressing problems.
? Humanitarian aid is not a matter for negotiation! Time and again, the UN Security Council is blocked by the individual interests of the major powers, even on humanitarian issues. This is evident in Syria, for example, and has fatal consequences for many people. We want to create a UN body that is independent of individual member states and enables aid to be delivered to conflict regions without requiring the approval of the Security Council.
? The UN's specialized agencies, such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) or the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), are unable to adequately respond to the crises due to underfunding. The rich member states must finally meet their payment obligations and close the funding gap. In the case of the UNHCR, this is only a fraction of Germany's refugee expenditure.
? In order to reduce the influence of private actors, we want to increase the basic contributions to the UN, especially for the rich countries.
Socially just worldwide
The West and the EU countries still benefit from unfair trade relations that are based on centuries of colonialism. The industrialized countries receive cheap raw materials and supply industrially manufactured goods. They also exploit the low wage levels of countries in the Global South for their own purposes. For these countries, this means cementing poverty. Instead, they should be put in a position to process raw materials themselves and protect the economic d e v e l o p m e n t of their countries. Working conditions at the end of European supply chains are often brutal. This has fatal consequences for billions of people: The global hunger crisis, triggered by the consequences of climate change, exploitation and unequal distribution of resources, is threatening millions of people worldwide. Global competition has long since broken out for resources such as rare earths, which are crucial for digitalization and climate- friendly restructuring. In the search for energy alternatives, countries in the Global South are threatened by "green colonialism". The dispute over Ukrainian grain exports has shown how fragile the food supply is in large parts of the world. Important global economic policy decisions are made by exclusive groups such as the Paris Group, G7 and G20. With the "splitting", i.e. the free trade agreement without the consent of the
72|
member states and their parliaments, democratic majorities are undermined.
Development programs of the Global North, such as the EU's Africa strategy, tend to serve the economic interests and influence of its elites and large corporations. They often legitimize existing inequalities without bringing about any noticeable improvement in the situation in the countries of the South. It is therefore no wonder that criticism of EU and US policies is now growing worldwide. On the other hand, an EU that negotiates inclusive solutions in our multipolar world would also gain diplomatic weight. A multilateral balance of interests also encompasses economic and development issues.
Cooperation between the countries of the North and the countries of the South must be fair, ecologically just and based on democratic principles. Global inequalities must finally be addressed through inclusive forums. We therefore welcome initiatives within the UN that give all affected countries a voice, such as the UN Financing for Development Forum and the proposals for a new global tax convention. The summits of the G77 countries are also of great importance in this respect. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (Agenda 2030) have committed the global community to goals that must be a central component of a policy based on cooperation with the countries of the Global South. Currently, the achievement of the Agenda 2030 goals is highly jeopardized.
Exceeding the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Climate Agreement will also have catastrophic consequences for the countries of the Global South. The concept of "common but differentiated responsibilities" from the global climate negotiations must also be applied to other policy areas.
Fair trade policy: cooperation instead of competition
We want to combat exploitation in North-South relations, fight poverty and hunger and distribute the burden of climate policy fairly. Security encompasses more than the absence of violence. The supply of good food must be guaranteed, there must be access to medical care, housing, culture, education and training in an intact environment.
? We want an effective European supply chain law that takes effective action against child labor, exploitation, human rights violations and environmental damage and prescribes clear due diligence obligations for companies. The financial sector must not be excluded from this law. The EU Council must pave the way for the European Parliament's Supply Chain Directive. (See Chapter 2, "For the socio-ecological raw materials transition")
? European Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) have often come about under strong pressure from the EU and are largely determined by the EU's economic interests. They provide for extensive free trade. As a result, these countries are flooded with cheap, industrially produced goods and local businesses are destroyed on a large scale. The EU must replace the EPAs with cooperation and investment agreements that are systematically geared towards achieving sustainability goals.
? The Left opposes free trade ideology and advocates fair cooperation agreements that are based on the UN sustainability goals, are in line with climate protection goals, human rights, development cooperation and the rights of dependent employees, and aim to combat poverty instead of the pursuit of profit.
|73
? Central components of fair agreements are: no trade in agricultural products whose production causes deforestation or endangers biodiversity; a raw materials transition that strengthens the circular economy (see Chapter 2, "More circular economy, less waste"), and the transfer of technology and knowledge.
? Democratic participation and transparency must be guaranteed in negotiations! We want the full involvement of civil society, including smallholder initiatives, women's networks, indigenous groups, etc. and strong parliamentary participation in negotiations. We need high quality and sustainability standards for products and services as well as clear rules on data protection. Special rights of corporations to sue must be abolished.
? Overcoming hunger and poverty means securing the livelihoods of farmers and agricultural workers worldwide! We want to support regions in not primarily farming for export. There must be an end to food markets being flooded with food from outside - for example subsidized by the EU. We want to promote organic production worldwide and agree on international systems that protect against price erosion.
? The EU should no longer support large-scale commercial agricultural projects ("green revolution"), which often disregard the supply of the local population. We reject the promotion of agriculture with hybrid seeds, heavy artificial fertilization and pesticides that make farmers dependent on chemical companies. The same applies to projects in which the local population is displaced from traditional farmland due to a lack of proof of ownership. Instead, we rely on programs that combine local knowledge and new technologies in order to secure the social situation and food sovereignty of the local population.
? The monitoring and evaluation of existing projects must be improved with regard to human rights, in particular the right to food.
? The EU has concluded fishing agreements with almost all West African countries, allowing European fleets to fish off their coasts on a large scale. Since then, African fishermen have been complaining about a sharp decline in stocks. The EU must ensure that fishing there and in other parts of the world is not restricted by European fishing. Supplying the local population through local fishing has priority over international economic interests.
? We reject the Mercosur agreement as it is currently being negotiated. This means that Latin America will remain a mere supplier of raw materials, with negative consequences for the climate, species protection and human rights. The agreement primarily serves corporations and disregards the needs of people and nature. Instead, we want relations between the EU and Latin America on an equal footing through a partnership agreement that protects workers' rights and the environment in all participating countries and promotes sustainable economic development.
? The Left condemns the USA's comprehensive economic, trade and financial blockade against Cuba. It fundamentally violates the Cuban people's right to a self- determined path of development. The EU must use its influence to work towards ending the US blockade and removing Cuba f r o m	t h e	US list of "terror- supporting states". Against this backdrop, the EU's 2016 Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement with Cuba is of particular importance. In order to effectively implement this agreement and fill it with life, all member states of the
74|
EU sign the agreement. The left rejects all attempts by right-wing forces in the EU Parliament to call this agreement into question.
? We support the UN treaty that obliges companies to respect the rights and dignity of employees. This gives employees the opportunity to assert their rights at their place of work anywhere in the world.
? We want an export ban on pesticides that are not permitted in the EU and its member states for environmental and health reasons. The goal of an agriculture without pesticides must be the basis of EU trade policy. (See Chapter 2, "For socio- ecological agriculture")
Global justice: canceling debt and financing development
Many countries in the Global South are in danger of suffocating under their debts. Over- indebtedness has dramatic consequences, as paying off interest leaves hardly any money for combating poverty, education and health. Instead of cutting debt, the EU finances development aid, for example through the Global Gateway initiative. Its main aim is to create incentives for private donors. This opens the door to lowering standards, deregulating markets and privatizing infrastructure. The initiative is being developed primarily on the basis of geostrategic considerations: as a counter-model to the Chinese Silk Road Initiative. It does not primarily serve to combat poverty. However, a global financing program must aim to improve the situation of local people.
? We are calling for a debt haircut and a sustainable debt relief initiative.
? We want the Global Gateway Initiative to focus on socio-ecological restructuring, transparent use of funds in partnership-based surpluses and clear human rights standards for companies.
? We reject the linking of development aid funds to isolation measures and border controls. The allocation of funds must not be tied to cooperation to prevent migration. (See Chapter 5, "Saving people: legal escape routes")
|75
Chapter 5: More democracy, less lobbying
We are fighting for an EU in which democracy can be experienced every day. We want to strengthen people's rights - for more participation and co-determination, against surveillance and exploitation. We want to strengthen the European Parliament and limit the influence of powerful lobby groups in Brussels. Democracy must mean more equality in the distribution of social wealth and in living conditions in the various countries in Europe and Germany. And it means more joint debate and co- determination of the many in trade unions, companies, schools and universities, associations and movements in the decisions that affect the lives of everyone in Europe. Public services and social provision must not be destroyed by the pursuit of profit, speculation and the market.
Democracy is not a question of declarations and fine words. Democracy needs social foundations, social structures and services. A strong welfare state not only protects against poverty, it also makes social cohesion and society a tangible experience.
Fundamental rights are more than just a defense against arbitrariness and surveillance. The right to housing is a fundamental right, as is the right to the inviolability of the home. The right to one's own data must be defended just as much as the right to live free from poverty. The fight for a fair distribution of wealth, for equal living conditions in the EU and for functioning social services of general interest are inseparable from the fight for more democracy.
Since the social foundations of democracies in Europe have been eroded, the right has become stronger. Right-wing governments are mobilizing against the welfare state and democracy, against people's rights and against employment protection laws, women's rights, queer people and refugees. They are fueling racism and misanthropy.
The Left stands against the far-right movements and parties throughout Europe. We defend ourselves against the dismantling of democracy and fundamental rights. We are fighting against racism and discrimination everywhere. We want to deprive the right of its fuel: The feeling of so many people that things are not fair is right, but the responses of the right are wrong and harmful. They promote injustice and unfairness and strengthen the power of the powerful in the name of the powerless. They play opposition in order to prevent real social opposition for peace and social improvement.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is good, it must finally be respected. Fundamental rights in Europe must be inviolable and enforceable. Refugees who make their way to the European Union are also bearers of these fundamental rights. How the EU treats refugees says something about human dignity everywhere in the EU. We defend the rights of refugees to life and humane treatment. We are also defending the rights of all people.
Over the past few years, thousands of European citizens, non-governmental organizations, associations and trade unions have developed ideas for the further development of the EU and for reforms of the EU institutions as part of the Conference on the Future of Europe (CoFE). The Conference on the Future of Europe offered a transnational democratic process for the first time. In 2022, 49 proposals with numerous concrete recommendations for action on climate protection, energy, migration, foreign and security policy, mobility, social affairs, health and care, youth and education were presented as a result. These proposals reflect the expectations of the European
76|
citizens: They want stronger public services, higher taxes for large companies, free education and childcare.
However, the proposals developed have not been bindingly incorporated into policy- making. The Left was part of the Conference on the Future of Europe, we share many of the demands and continue to advocate their realization. EU policy should be developed jointly in order to make the EU more sustainable and resilient with a view to combating the multiple cross-border crises.
Democratize EU institutions - strengthen the European Parliament
We want to overcome the permanent blockades within the EU - especially by the European Council - and give the regions greater co-determination. The right of initiative for EU laws lies solely with the EU Commission. Lobby groups have a strong institutionalized influence on the Commission in particular. We therefore call for
? The European Council is to be transformed into a second chamber.
? The European Parliament must be given an unrestricted right of initiative so that it can initiate legislative processes itself and thus develop policy.
? In the area of economic and monetary union, Parliament should be able to make decisions on an equal footing with the Council and the Euro Group.
? Only the European Parliament should be able to propose, elect and dismiss the Commission and the President of the Commission.
? The European Parliament should be given sole budgetary rights for its responsibilities. It should also exercise democratic control over the ECB. (See chapter 1,
"European monetary policy")
? The Committee of the Regions is to be strengthened by including it in the decision- making structure of the EU institutions. In future, the regions are to be effectively involved in policy-making. The Committee of the Regions will then no longer only formulate opinions of a recommendatory nature, but will also be able to have a say in Parliament's legislative initiatives and introduce them itself.
Putting a stop to lobbyism
An estimated 25,000 lobbyists with an annual budget of 1.5 billion euros influence the EU institutions in Brussels. Around 70 percent of them work for companies and trade associations. They enjoy privileged access to the commissioners. They exert massive influence on the legislative process and inundate MEPs with amendments to bills - or try to write the laws themselves. The Left Party wants to put a stop to the influence of pro-business lobbyists.
? We want to make bribery of MPs an effective criminal offense. The existing tougher penalties are not enough. Anyone who accepts consideration for actions or omissions in connection with the exercise of their mandate as a member of parliament should be punished. We want to abolish restrictions and exceptions.
? Members of parliament's fringe benefits must be published promptly and to the exact euro.
? We want to ban donations from companies and lobbyists to parties in the European Parliament and party sponsorship, such as company stands at party conferences, and limit donations from private individuals to 25,000 euros per year.
|77
? We demand digitally readable, legally binding lobby and transparency registers that make the influence of lobby groups on legislation visible.
? Members of the European Commission who, after leaving office, move to private- sector companies whose economic interests they were previously politically involved with must adhere to a strict waiting period. The length of the waiting period should be based on their term of office and the resulting entitlement to a transitional allowance.
New treaties and a constitution for the EU
The left wants to unblock democracy in the European Union. The Maastricht and Lisbon Treaties have written neoliberalism into the foundations of the EU. We need a peaceful, social and democratic EU with changed treaty foundations, new structures and new hopes. A new constitution can only be developed by and with the people, trade unions, social movements and civil society actors in Europe. We want to create a public and democratic space for the debate on the constitution and the democratization of the institutions and push back the dominance of the European Council.
? That is why we are calling for a constitutional convention. Representatives from the EU member states should discuss a draft constitution together with trade unions, social and environmental associations and other non-governmental organizations. The results of the European Conference on the Future in 2022 are a good basis. The process of the Conference on the Future can serve as a model for the participation process of such a constitutional convention.
A change to the European treaties has been under serious discussion for the first time since 2007, as the crises of war and corona have made it clear that the neo-liberal foundations are not sustainable. The excessive debt regulations prevent long-term social tasks from being publicly financed in the long term. However, instead of bringing public services such as energy and water, railroads, postal services, telecommunications, education, healthcare, etc. back into public hands, bureaucratic and inefficient structures are being created to monitor the companies that provide these services in a common market. The consequences can be seen everywhere: Public services of general interest are being run down, healthcare systems are collapsing, rail and local transport are not working, there are huge gaps in education and there is far too little investment in sustainable energy and the economy.
? The Left demands that public direct investment by states and the ECB and the economic activity of the EU, federal government, federal states and local authorities to strengthen the social and ecological transformation of the economy and public services of general interest be included and strengthened in the EU treaties.
? The privatization of services must no longer be stipulated and promoted in contracts.
? The citizens of the candidate countries must be able to vote on accession to the EU in referendums.
? Accession must not be made conditional on the implementation of neoliberal economic reforms.
78|
To get things moving: more citizen participation and direct democracy
More than three quarters of all European citizens would like to have a greater say in decision-making in the EU. Citizens' initiatives are an important means of achieving this. We are committed to ensuring that bureaucratic hurdles for initiatives are lowered and that the results are bindingly incorporated into the legislative process.
? Citizens in the EU should be given the right to help shape EU policy and initiate laws through referendums and popular demands.
? More citizens' councils to strengthen democracy! We demand that citizens' councils - comparable to the transformation councils - be set up across Europe. This should strengthen the voice and participation of citizens.
? The European Future Conference is to be made permanent in the form of regular Citizens' Councils on thematic priorities and the Commission's annual work program. This will enable citizens and young people in particular to contribute their ideas to future EU legislative projects in advance.
? The European Citizens' Initiative must be developed into fully valid EU citizens' legislation: Every successfully submitted European Citizens' Initiative must be submitted to the European Parliament for a decision so that it can be implemented in accordance with the applicable legislative procedure. The initiators should be given the right to carry out an EU citizens' petition and to seek an EU-wide referendum if the Parliament has rejected their initiative.
? We demand that the 49 proposals of the European Conference on the Future become the basis for the work of the next Commission, including the proposals that require treaty changes. We call on the candidates for the presidency of the Commission to publicly position themselves on this.
? An EU participation infrastructure needs a central online access point for all participation instruments. All participation instruments must be accessible and explained on the access point and citizens must be able to use it to network.
Strengthening fundamental and human rights - for all
We want to strengthen fundamental rights in Europe. The EU must finally accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. The Convention on Human Rights must be supplemented by the right to asylum and protection for refugees and made binding for every EU member state.
? In accordance with the revised European Social Charter of the Council of Europe, fundamental social rights must also be enforceable by individuals before the European Court of Justice.
? Social benefits in one state must not be restricted for citizens of other EU states, as is repeatedly demanded by the right in the case of child benefit. A decent minimum standard of living must be guaranteed at all times, regardless of residence status.
? No data storage without suspicion: The collection, processing and sharing of personal data within and between European and national authorities must be kept to a minimum.
? In order to prevent a violation of fundamental rights and to ensure the protection of everyone's privacy, we are calling for a Europe-wide ban on the
|79
Use of facial recognition technology in public spaces. Studies show that such software is susceptible to inaccuracies, racial discrimination and identity fraud.
? We want the situation of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights in the EU to be regularly evaluated on a country-specific basis and violations to be sanctioned by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).
? Improve rule of law mechanisms: If member states do not respect the EU's fundamental values, a stop to payments of funding must be regulated more precisely in future - for example, projects in the social sector, integration or education projects must not be jeopardized. In the event of serious violations of these fundamental values, the state in question should be stripped of its voting rights in the Council.
? Millions of people who have lived and worked here for decades should not be allowed to have a say in politics just because they have the wrong passport. We demand a common EU electoral law with active and passive voting rights for all people who live permanently in the EU.
? Young people must also be able to participate more in politics. At present, 16 and 17- year-olds are only allowed to vote in the European Parliament elections in four EU member states. We want the right to vote to be lowered to 16 in all EU member states.
? Germany must abandon its blockade stance and agree to the EU's Equal Treatment Directive, which prohibits discrimination based on age, sexual orientation, religion or disability, among other things. There must be no age discrimination in the EU. We reject the EU Commission's plans for compulsory and random checks on driving ability and temporary driving licenses.
The European Parliament has spoken out against racism and discrimination on various occasions - also on the initiative of the LEFT. Words must be followed by deeds:
? We want the EU to reliably promote cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe.
? The Copenhagen criteria for the protection of the rights of minorities, which all candidate countries signed up to in 2004, must be observed by all member states.
? The EU should work towards the Europe-wide recognition of the Yenish as a minority.
? Sinti*zze and Rom*nja have the right to make use of the freedom of movement regulations everywhere in the EU. Discriminatory special regulations must be abolished.
A union of equal rights: Gender equality - Europe-wide
Throughout Europe, women earn less than men, do more care work in the family and receive less pension in old age. Poorer women, mainly from Eastern Europe, care for people in need of care in countries such as Germany under undignified conditions.
Social inequality between women is growing: some have careers, others clean their homes. In Germany alone, a woman is killed every third day (femicide). For hundreds of thousands of women in Europe, violence by their partners is an everyday experience.
The left is fighting against
80|
We are committed to improving the living conditions of all women, trans and other queer people. We are committed to improving the living conditions of all women and consistently protecting them from violence. For us, advancing equal rights at all levels is linked to struggles for good work and good wages, for a different distribution of social wealth and social (care) work, for sexual and gender self-determination, against exploitation and exclusion and against anti-feminism, homophobia and trans-hostility.
? Good work and social security for all women. Women often work in precarious, non- socially insured employment relationships. We want to transfer them to regular employment with good working conditions. For sectors whose business model is based on involuntary part-time work (for example in the retail trade), we demand the right to a full-time position.
? End wage discrimination across Europe - equal pay for work of equal value. We are committed to shorter working hours throughout Europe in order to create more equality between the sexes. We are proposing a reduction to around 30 hours per week (4-day week): with full pay and necessary staff compensation and for employees to choose flexibly over their professional biography. This would allow more men to take on unpaid care work. (See Chapter 1, "Redistributing for good work")
? We are fighting for anti-discrimination laws in all EU states with the right to bring collective actions.
? Combat sexism and strengthen women's rights: We want binding anti-sexism regulations in the public and private sector.
? Better pay and more staff in "women's professions" (care, social and educational services, retail). We support strikes by employees in these areas and their trade unions.
? Care work must be financially and socially upgraded: Better pay and good working conditions will make caring professions (such as nursing and education) more attractive (for men who lose their jobs in industry, for example). This is also an answer to the shortage of skilled workers. (See Chapter 1, "Redistributing for good work")
? We want to convert informal work in private households to provide 24-hour care for people in need of care ("live-in care") into regular employment relationships with social insurance, statutory working hours, vacations and a minimum wage.
? The conditions for family caregivers must be improved. (See Chapter 1, "Good health and care")
? Comprehensive care services for children and the elderly throughout Europe.
? The Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence must be implemented unconditionally in all member states.
? Comprehensive care for women affected by violence with shelters, counseling services and psychological support. Digital violence against women must also be combated.
? Binding minimum standards for local medical care (outpatient and inpatient) in the event of illness and pregnancy (with pre- and postnatal care services). (See Chapter 1, "Good health and care")
? We want to provide more financial support for independent women's health facilities and initiatives as well as women-specific health research.
|81
? Violence against women, trans and queer people and their persecution must be recognized as grounds for asylum throughout Europe.
? Specific support and psychological assistance is needed for victims of sexual violence from war zones and inhumane regimes.
? Needs-based accommodation and shelters for refugee women and their children as well as for trans and queer people. Specialist social education staff with gender- and queer-sensitive training in the shelters.
? Financial support for initiatives for the self-organization and representation of the interests of refugee women and queer people.
? Strengthen reproductive rights throughout Europe. Abolish all restrictions on the right to abortion in the criminal codes of EU member states. Financial support for alliances for sexual and bodily self-determination as well as medical students and doctors who campaign for the decriminalization of abortion.
? Free contraception (including the morning-after pill) for all. Funds must be made available for research into new contraceptives, especially for men.
? Safe and free access to abortion everywhere in Europe.
? EU-wide funding program for school and extracurricular educational work against sexism and queer hostility, which includes initiatives for those affected.
? Strengthen the rights of sex workers, improve their health care with low-threshold services and support their self-organization, enable safer places of work and prevent stigmatization, repression and criminalization of sex workers and clients.
? We want to better protect victims of human trafficking - including "human trafficking for sexual exploitation" - (right of residence, psychological support, legal aid and legal assistance, access to social benefits).
Queer, social and fair
The Left wants a Europe in which lesbian, gay, bi, trans, inter and non-binary (= queer) people can live free of fear, self-determined and socially secure lives.
This goal has not been achieved in any EU member state, even if the legal conditions for queer people have improved in some countries. At the same time, they have deteriorated in other countries. Across the EU, queer people are disproportionately affected by poverty and exclusion. This is particularly evident in the world of work, education and healthcare. The (self-determination) rights of trans, intersex and non- binary people are also not yet recognized in all EU member states. The EU Commission's LGBTIQ equality strategy is a step in the right direction. However, it must be supplemented to include issues such as homelessness, isolation and healthcare.
? More funding for the self-organization and representation of queer people's interests. The financial support for civil society initiatives and NGOs that stand up for their rights and concerns must be expanded and consolidated throughout Europe.
? National action plans against discrimination and for the equality of queer people in all member states, which are expanded to include social aspects so that socio- economically disadvantaged queer people also benefit from the programs.
? Projects to protect queer young people and older queer people from homelessness. Housing First offers for these groups.
82|
? Knowledge about the social reality of queer people's lives in the EU must be improved. The EU should award research contracts for this purpose.
? Hate violence, especially against trans, intersex and non-binary people, must be prosecuted and punished more consistently. Hate crime must be recorded more accurately in statistics and published regularly. Discrimination by state authorities such as the police must be effectively combated.
? We want to strengthen the prevention of trans- and queer-hostile violence in all areas of society. Awareness-raising and sensitization measures are particularly necessary in education, child and youth welfare, administration and the world of work.
? Companies should be obliged to promote the independent self-organization of their queer employees with appropriate resources and to develop strategies against discrimination in the workplace.
? A self-determination law for trans, inter and non-binary people in all EU member states and uniform regulations regarding self-determined gender entry in official documents.
? More counseling and health centers for queer and especially for trans and inter people and comprehensive and free health care that is low-threshold and sensitive to discrimination.
? No leniency towards discrimination against queer communities by individual member states! The EU Commission must make consistent use of treaty violation proceedings. Germany should fundamentally participate as an intervener in these cases.
? The EU must also take a clear stance against human rights violations against queer people outside the EU and protest against them. Humanitarian visas for queer refugees!
? Currently, the rights of the parents of 2 million children in the EU are not fully recognized in another Member State. We want Europe-wide equality for rainbow families. The EU Commission has adopted a proposal for a regulation to this end. We are working to ensure that the European Council also adopts this proposal.
? Reform of parentage law so that children in rainbow families have equal rights. Children of lesbian, bisexual, trans, intersex and non-binary parents are still dependent on stepchild adoption in order to have a second legal parent.
? It must be possible to take on family responsibilities independently of marriage. Rainbow families, in which parenthood is not tied to the couple's constellation, and multiple parenthoods also need legal recognition.
? We want to base custody and visitation rights on the best interests of the child.
A socially just Europe must be inclusive
For an inclusive and social Europe, we demand the full participation of all people in all areas of society, regardless of skin color, language, sexual orientation or gender identity, whether they are old or young or live with a disability.
The Left is fighting for a Europe in which people with disabilities and chronic illnesses are not disadvantaged and marginalized. All EU member states are still a long way from achieving this goal. Improvements for the 80 million people in Europe who live with a disability are being blocked by the fact that some countries are preventing the implementation of the 5th EU Equality Directive at national level.
|83
This also includes Germany. People with disabilities are at above-average risk of unemployment and poverty. Many people with disabilities have to live in residential facilities against their wishes. This violates their right to self-determination.
The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is insufficiently implemented in Germany, as a review by the United Nations for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities revealed this year. People with disabilities are still relegated to the highly developed system of special structures in school education, employment in workshops and large inpatient residential facilities. But only an inclusive society is democratic and socially just. In order to make an inclusive Europe a reality for all people under the motto "nothing about us without us", we call for the following:
? We want to strengthen the fight for equality and non-discrimination as a fundamental and general principle for the protection of human rights. Germany's blockade in the implementation of the 5th EU Equality Directive must be ended.
? All special institutions for people with disabilities - especially with regard to learning, working and living - must be abolished.
? Lifelong learning and an inclusive education system must be guaranteed at all levels, from nursery to university and beyond (Article 24 UN CRPD).
? We want an inclusive labor market. The statutory minimum wage must apply in all areas in which people with disabilities work.
? Disabled people must be able to decide for themselves how, where and with whom they want to live.
? The right to the highest attainable standard of health must be enforced without discrimination on the basis of disability (Article 25 of the UN CRPD).
? Refugees and asylum seekers with disabilities need special protection on the basis of the European Reception Directive for particularly vulnerable persons in the asylum procedure.
? Programs for the equality of women, girls and members of the queer communities with disabilities must be set up. They are confronted with multiple discrimination in all areas of life.
? Accessibility in the municipalities, including the entire public transport system.
? Accessibility must also be mandatory in the private sector, including online retail.
? Accessible communication must be possible for all people with disabilities according to their individual needs (blind and visually impaired people, deaf and hearing impaired people, people with learning difficulties). This must include digital accessibility.
? A European Disability Card, which gives people with disabilities access to special conditions in all Member States, must be introduced quickly.
? People with disabilities and their self-representation organizations must be able to participate in democratic processes without restrictions. Inclusive, barrier-free structures must also be created for this.
? To ensure that the right to vote can be exercised, technical means such as tactile templates, QR codes or instructions in easy-to-read language, sign language or Braille are required.
84|
? All discrimination against people with disabilities in legal proceedings, especially with regard to special psychiatric laws and coercive medical or guardianship powers, must be abolished!
Fight against the right
Europe is experiencing a dangerous shift to the right. After decades of neoliberal dismantling of social rights, isolation from refugees and policies that have accepted the impoverishment of certain regions and countries, far-right parties are on the rise in many countries, and in some places they are already in government. All too often, the bourgeois parties adopt the language and demands of the far right, thereby strengthening them. The effect is an erosion of democracy, human rights and humanity at European level. This is inextricably linked to the militarization of society.
The left opposes the extreme right. We stand up everywhere against nationalism, nationalist ideologies and racism, against anti-Muslim racism and antiziganism, against anti-Semitism and homophobia, against all forms of misanthropy. The left stands and fights for the equality of all people: Human dignity is inviolable. Consequences must be drawn from the "Never again!" of liberation from fascism. That is our motivation and our mission. We take to the streets with anti-fascists throughout Europe and stand in the way of the neo-Nazis; we defend the public space against the right's attempts to spread fear there. The right wants to dismantle fundamental and civil rights and weaken democratic institutions. In contrast, Die Linke is committed to more democracy and more social rights.
There is no contradiction between the interests of the working class and the demands of feminism, anti-racism, the LGBTTIQ* movement and the fight against climate change. Solidarity is our weapon - it is indivisible!
? The recommendations of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance and the Fundamental Rights Agency must be implemented in the Member States. If they are not implemented, sanctions must follow.
? The EU action plan against racism should be extended beyond 2025. Representatives of groups at risk of racism, experts and scientists must be included. In 2020, the majority of MEPs supported the Black Lives Matter movement in a resolution - but without legal consequences. The EU must exert influence on the member states to combat racial profiling, racist police violence and institutional racism.
? The Left demands that Europe-wide programs be financially strengthened to provide long-term and permanent funding for initiatives and projects against racism and other forms of discrimination. They should become part of a European preventive architecture against all forms of racism and neo-fascism.
? The far right is networked across Europe. This is why transnational monitoring projects must be created and supported. The findings on transnational links in right- wing terrorism must be pooled and evaluated.
? We want the victims of right-wing violence to have the right to stay in the EU in order to counter the perpetrators' intention to drive them out.
We condemn attacks on mosques, synagogues and other sacred or symbolic places. Left- wing people and structures are also repeatedly targeted
|85
of right-wing attacks. We stand together and show solidarity with victims of right-wing violence and their families. They must be better supported in the long term. The Left is committed to making the Day of Liberation from Fascism and the End of War a public holiday throughout the EU.
Security instead of a surveillance state - police in a constitutional state
Under the slogans "combating cross-border crime" and "irregular" migration, the EU has massively expanded cooperation between security authorities in recent decades. It is based on extensive databases that affect one population group in particular: migrants. The "Interoperability Regulation" comprehensively links these databases via a common query portal: EURODAC to record asylum seekers, VIS to record visa applicants, the Entry/Exit System (EES) currently being developed to record all entries of third-country nationals and their residence permits, the European Travellers Identifcation and Authoriza- tion System (ETIAS) to record all third-country nationals who are exempt from the visa requirement. Biometric data is stored for all of them, which can be used to search the databases. In addition, there is the Schengen Information System (SIS), which includes wanted persons and objects as well as entry bans. Billions of euros have been spent on setting up systems that are intended to ensure that migrants are recorded without gaps and at the same time are an expression of general suspicion against this population group. Social movements and soccer fans are now also monitored across borders, and fundamental rights are repeatedly restricted during large demonstrations, for example.
We defend fundamental rights and want to expand democracy. We want to return from the huge data dumps costing billions to a system of mutual legal assistance in which the police authorities can request personal data from other authorities in individual cases.
The EU Commission regularly declares that it wants to t a k e action against racism and hate speech, but hardly presents any concrete measures. In Germany, unlawful police violence mainly affects poor people who are disproportionately members of non-white minorities and are subject to particular suspicion (racial profiling). Racist and disproportionate policing plays an important role in perpetuating origin-specific inequality in Europe.
? Measures that are based solely or largely on the external appearance of those affected must be prevented: Checks by police authorities without suspicion must be prohibited. We need clear guidelines for practice, which should include preventive training and strict measures for accountability and punishment of violations.
? We reject police raids that target migrant neighborhoods across the board. The same applies to the use of stigmatizing terms such as "clan crime" and
"social hotspots" as a basis for police work and justification for raids. We are committed to ensuring that ethnic categories are generally excluded from personal references in police work.
? The EU institutions should initiate a Europe-wide review of nationally applied police techniques and methods for detaining people and work with Member States to ban methods that can cause irreversible harm or death.
? The European Commission must provide guidelines for independent police complaints bodies and their powers to review police measures.
86|
? The implementation of the Victim Protection Directive must be monitored. Victims of police brutality must be protected within the framework of the EU mechanism at national level.
? The increasing criminalization of social movements in the EU must be stopped. Protest and civil disobedience are legitimate and necessary for a living democracy.
The borders of democracy: No Fortress Europe
Almost 30,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean since 2014. This terrible record of European isolationist policies must lead to a fundamental change in EU asylum policy. We stand for an EU that offers safe protection to refugees, that does not make deals with dictators and that outlaws war as a political tool. That finally prevents tens of thousands from drowning in the Mediterranean. Flight is not a crime! In its treaties, the EU has committed itself to complying with the Geneva Refugee Convention. It violates this every day: people seeking protection are mistreated at the EU's external borders and illegally pushed back. In June 2023, more than 500 people died off Pylos as a result of an attempted push-back by the Greek coast guard. Even behind the meter-high border fence on the Polish-Belarusian border, people seeking protection regularly die in frost and mud, i n some cases after being illegally pushed back by Poland. Nevertheless, the EU Commission did not initiate infringement proceedings against unlawful pushbacks. This deadly cronyism of isolationism must end! The border protection agency Frontex was at least indirectly involved in pushbacks or covered them up. International maritime law obliges us to rescue people in distress at sea, and they must not be returned to unsafe countries such as Libya.
The Left Party stands for a solidary and humane migration and asylum policy that takes the Geneva Refugee Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights and, overall, human rights and humanity as the yardstick for its actions.
Right-wing parties stoke fears that migration threatens prosperity. But prosperity and social security are under threat because borders are much more permeable for corporations and banks than for people fleeing war and misery. Against the grand coalition of isolationism, who want to sell us more fences and walls as solutions and accept tens of thousands of deaths, we are aiming for a society without isolation.
Saving people: Legal escape routes
The EU first concluded a comprehensive partnership agreement with Turkey and now with Tunisia, which provides for the protection of refugees at the EU's external borders in return for investment. Four months earlier, the European Parliament had criticized the many human rights violations in Tunisia: The parliament was suspended, journalists, judges and trade unionists were arbitrarily imprisoned. Now Tunisia is receiving 1.5 billion euros from the EU. That is a scandal.
Inhumane conditions prevail in the camps at the EU's external borders. Border and camp security is being upgraded. Human rights violations, torture, abduction and rape occur regularly.
? We reject an advance of border defense, be it in Africa or elsewhere. No deals with dictatorships!
? Sea bridges and ferries instead of Frontex! Frontex must be transformed into a European rescue mission.
|87
? We call for an effective and fully-funded monitoring mechanism against pushbacks and human rights violations at the EU's external borders.
? Sea rescue is not only legal, it is mandatory under international maritime law. An EU-funded sea rescue mission is needed to end the mass deaths in the Mediterranean and ensure disembarkation in a safe port in the EU.
? As the EU is not fulfilling this obligation, civil society is trying to close this g a p . This commitment must be appreciated and supported instead of criminalizing it. Civil sea rescue must not be criminalized or systematically hindered.
? We need safe escape routes for refugees to the EU, humanitarian visas for legal entry and/or the lifting of the visa requirement for those seeking protection.
? Admission regulations for people in need of protection must be expanded, for example through the UNHCR's resettlement program.
? Poverty, environmental and climate refugees must be granted binding refugee rights. Nobody flees voluntarily!
? Border controls in the Schengen area and now also in Germany are illegal and we reject them. The "stationary border controls" take place primarily at the EU's eastern internal borders. Freedom of movement in the Schengen area was introduced in 1995 and is a major step forward. Asylum seekers must not be turned back and they must be able to apply for asylum regardless of which country they are in.
Asylum as a fundamental right - without restrictions
We reject the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). It is a moral declaration of bankruptcy and a cave-in to right-wing forces in Europe. It aggravates the situation at the external borders, imprisons people seeking protection and endangers human lives. No fair examination is possible in fast-track procedures and under detention conditions.
With this decision, EU governments are disenfranchising people in need of protection and raising the walls of Fortress Europe. Barbed wire instead of a welcoming culture is the message of the EU asylum reform.
? We want a humane and human rights-based reception system that guarantees the humane care and accommodation of people seeking protection at all times without restrictions.
? There must be no outsourcing of asylum procedures to third countries.
? Away from the "hotspot" policy: We demand humane reception conditions instead of camps where people seeking protection are detained under inhumane conditions with no prospects.
? The unfair Dublin system must be overcome and replaced by a system based on solidarity. When determining the host country, the legitimate interests of those seeking protection must be taken into account (e.g. family ties, language skills). Countries, cities and regions that are willing to accept refugees should receive special financial and structural support from EU funds.
? Family reunification must be guaranteed without restriction, especially for beneficiaries of international protection and other persons in need of protection who cannot return to their country of origin.
? We are fundamentally opposed to deportations, especially to war, persecution and misery or as a form of double punishment - in contrast to all other parliamentary groups in the Bundestag and the European Parliament. We have always voted against this and will continue to do so in the future.
88|
? The individual needs of particularly vulnerable groups must be taken into account: queer refugees, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable groups. Their special protection and assistance needs require qualified specialist staff and suitable accommodation. Civil society initiatives and NGOs that stand up for their rights and self-organization must be financially supported and strengthened.
? Unite families! The definition of family needs to be extended to same-sex partnerships not recognized in the countries of origin and to second-degree relatives, especially for unaccompanied minors.
Welcome needs structures
We want an EU fund for welcoming municipalities that ensures freedom of movement for refugees and helps welcoming municipalities and cities that show solidarity.
Municipalities that want to improve the conditions for a welcoming culture can apply for funding for the care and integration of refugees. They can use these investment funds for public services in general - this is how solidarity wins!
? We are calling for a social offensive for all, well-equipped public services and we want to combat shortages in local communities and on the ground.
? We want a European refugee levy in order to share responsibility fairly. It is based on the wishes and interests of the refugees and takes into account existing family ties, language skills and individual circumstances.
? Access for refugees and migrants to the labour market and international schools and the recognition of qualifications, professional qualifications and experience must be simplified. There must be low-threshold offers for language courses.
? EU-wide solutions require transnational cooperation and joint concepts. Interreg funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) are to be made available for cooperation between regions and countries within the EU for this purpose.
Legalization now!
No one is illegal! Hundreds of thousands of people live in Europe without papers or secure residence status. People with and without a right of residence or work permit perform work without which our everyday life and our economy would not function. They work - often for the lowest wages - in private households and i n care, agriculture, construction and the hospitality industry. Because they often have no residence papers or work permits, they are increasingly exposed to exploitation and fraud by employers or landlords.
? People without residence status often have no opportunity to take out health insurance. We want them to have access to good healthcare. They should not have to fear that doctors or hospitals will report them to the police or immigration authorities.
? People have a right to freedom of movement and a right to choose their place of residence. This is also required by the European Convention on Human Rights.
? People without papers must not be criminalized! We are committed to an EU-wide coordinated legalization campaign.
|89
Learning together: Education
Education must be financed from public funds in line with demand. Funding for education programs in the EU has increased: Erasmus+, the flagship of the EU's education programs, and COSME, a program for the further education and employment of young people, among other things, received twice as much money in the last budget. The focus on "competitiveness" has remained. The European Education Area (EEA) should make access to education easier for everyone. However, more needs to be
done to eliminate inequality in education - as the 2022 Interim Report also shows. Inequality has worsened during the pandemic. Up to 32% of all learners were temporarily cut off from educational processes in spring 2020. In the European Parliament, the Left has been particularly committed to more access for the socially disadvantaged and more programs for teachers. We need socially open, critical and emancipatory education and correspondingly democratic, needs-based funded institutions. We are fighting for an education system that is publicly funded in line with needs and organized in a socially permeable way everywhere in Europe, from nursery school to doctorate, without fees.
? The education system is part of public services of general interest and must be publicly funded.
? We are committed to ensuring that EU education policy relates to the entire democratic education process and is not limited to the acquisition of knowledge in mathematics, information technology, natural sciences and technology (STEM subjects).
? Intercultural dialog, humanistic education, democratic exchange as well as independent and socially critical research and teaching are part of all inclusive educational approaches.
? We call for the reform of the Bologna system. Universities are more than just institutions for labor market qualification, as they were understood in the Bologna Process. Universities throughout Europe must be designed and understood as open, social and democratic institutions where teaching and research can develop freely and independently of the market and profit, but with social responsibility.
? Taking up an apprenticeship or course of study must ensure the right to stay and protect against deportation. We also want to enable academics who are politically persecuted to continue their academic work at universities in Germany and the EU.
For independent media and the right to criticism
The media must be able to report independently and critically so that people can participate in societal decisions in an informed manner. In the EU, too, journalists and activists for climate justice and human rights are being subjected to lawsuits with no prospect of success in order to intimidate them. The aim is to prevent public criticism or drive the relevant non-governmental organizations into bankruptcy.
? We are calling for the EU's new anti-SLAPP directive (SLAPP: Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) to be tightened up.
? The planned media freedom law provides for the "protection of national security" as a possible reason for restricting press freedom. We reject this.
? Journalists affected should receive legal and psychological counseling and have their costs reimbursed.
90|
? Media need publicity. European fictional and documentary productions should be made more accessible and findable throughout Europe.
? The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a threat to freedom of expression and the rule of law, as criticized by the international association of civil rights movements (European Digital Rights, EDRi). Proactive algorithmic filters used against social media users severely restrict freedom of expression. The proposed law strengthens economic interests against digital civil rights. Digital works created with the participation of the public sector or public companies must be published as digital commons under open licenses.
? We demand comprehensive protection for whistleblowers. So far, the new whistleblower law in the EU and Germany excludes secret services and their illegal operations.
Creative Europe
During the pandemic, many creatives across Europe have been forced into unemployment and the receipt of transfer payments. The working conditions of creative professionals must be crisis-proofed and regulated according to trade union standards.
? We want to strengthen a culture of sharing. Free access to and use of knowledge and culture must be safeguarded. This includes far-reaching fair use regulations, a shortening of the term of protection and barrier regulations for science and education.
? The European regulation on net neutrality must be tightened up so that Internet companies cannot continue to circumvent it with impunity.
? The European framework conditions for the rights of independent workers must be regulated by law and minimum wages and fees must be introduced.
? In order to create an EU-wide framework for better working conditions for cultural producers, the introduction of a Europe-wide "fair work label" in the creative sector should be examined. Such a label should be awarded to all concert offers, music titles, computer games, theater events, books and exhibitions if creative workers are well paid and have proper contracts.
? No double taxation for cross-border work for joint productions.
? The funds agreed for 2021 to 2027 for the Creative Europe MEDIA program to support the cultural and creative industries must be adapted to the current crisis situation and increased.
European remembrance policy
We call for a critical examination of the history of the EU. The reappraisal and remembrance of colonialism and the associated slave trade and slavery must become more present.
? A legal basis should be created for the EU for the restitution of unlawfully acquired cultural assets from colonial contexts and research into provenance should be expanded. The restitution of Nazi-looted art must also be regulated by law, as it was traded throughout the EU, among other things.
? The consequences of slavery still have an impact worldwide today through traditional and revived racism. We demand recognition for the victims. Legal regulations for compensation claims must be created. This is in the
|91
European Convention on Human Rights, but is not enforced.
? A critical examination of the colonial legacy must become part of the curriculum.
? The purchase of currently looted cultural assets, for example from Syria and Iraq, by museums and private individuals must be stopped. Such goods must be returned.
? As sea levels rise and extreme weather events increase, it is becoming more difficult to preserve UNESCO World Heritage sites and monuments. We are calling for an EU program for maintenance and preservation, comparable to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
Protect consumers
Companies, banks and corporations have the upper hand vis-à-vis consumers and often exploit their power - for example, in the case of emissions fraud by car manufacturers in the diesel scandal. The Left not only focuses on transparency, we also want to strengthen consumer rights. Many shady business practices target people on low incomes and senior citizens - for whom this rip-off hurts their wallets in particular. Consumer associations must be given more rights.
They bundle the individual interests of many people against companies, some of which are global. Even after the implementation of this EU directive, the protection of economic interests is still the primacy of association actions. The consumer associations must provide high liability securities and provide evidence of at least 50 claims.
? We call for an opt-out procedure like in the Netherlands, where consumers do not have to register in a register of complaints beforehand.
? There is a need for far-reaching information and disclosure rights vis-à-vis authorities and companies.
? Rights to lodge complaints with the authorities in order to be able to call on them to take concrete action against unfair companies must be created.
? The work of consumer organizations must be independent and adequately funded. Companies must be involved according to the polluter pays principle. State revenues from antitrust penalties and unfair corporate profits must flow directly to the organizations.
? Travel law: We want to create a general right to sue and claim damages, especially for booking portals - optionally in the country where the company is based and where the plaintiff/damaged party is located.
? Nutrition: Comprehensible and consumer-friendly nutrition labeling should become mandatory.
? We call for strict adherence to the precautionary principle in the regulation of endocrine disruptors.
? We need a chemicals policy that prioritizes human health. According to the EU Chemicals Regulation (REACH) to reduce the use of carcinogenic and non- biodegradable substances, it takes more than ten years before a chemical already in use can be banned. In contrast, we demand fast and reliable testing procedures.
? Limit values for the contamination of food and water with chemicals and/or germs must not be raised in order to protect the interests of individual industries, such as European fisheries. Economic policy
92|
must not be at the expense of health, especially when it comes to the accumulation of substances in animal products.
? We call for a ban on toxic chemicals. Perfluorinated and polyfluorinated alkyl compounds (PFAS) are perpetual chemicals because they cannot be broken down by the environment. We welcome the fact that they may no longer be used for certain products. We call for the ban to be extended to all products.
Data protection and protection from state surveillance
We need strong European data protection that counteracts mass data storage by public and private actors. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted before the last European elections.
Since then, it has been undermined by the creation of closed data spaces, such as the European Health Data Space (EHDS). We want to counter this trend in the EU Commission. We are committed to the consistent implementation of the GDPR, especially when it comes to large corporations such as Facebook. Die Linke has campaigned for a complete ban on tracing and personalized advertising in order to put an end to unscrupulous business practices. In the Digital Services Act, Die Linke was able to push through a ban on personalized advertising for minors and better protection of personal data. The collection of highly sensitive data on health or sexual and political orientation for advertising purposes will be prohibited in future. We are committed to using data for the common good instead of for the profit of a few.
? With the GDPR and sector-specific data regulation, we want to prevent the further commercialization of data.
? The EU must put pressure on Ireland to impose billions in fines on Facebook for data protection violations.
? No lessons have been learned from Edward Snowden's revelations ten years ago: The exchange of data with the USA violates European data protection and must be stopped.
? We are calling for the long-planned ePrivacy Regulation. Private electronic communication must be more strongly protected. We reject mass scanning of private communication, as well as chat control.
? We generally reject the reading of end-to-end encrypted communication on end devices using spyware or state trojans (source telecommunication surveillance, online searches). It is a security risk, as vulnerabilities in the software are deliberately kept open - which can also be exploited by criminals.
? We take a critical view of the EU project for the digital wallet (EUid wallet) from a data protection perspective. The digital ID card must remain linked to a physical chip card in order to guarantee sufficient security. It must be ensured that personal data from the digital wallet cannot be linked or traced. The revision of the eIDAS Regulation must also not lead to private companies carrying out sovereign tasks in the future. Instead, we advocate the data-saving expansion of open source applications for the electronic ID card, including at EU level.
? People must not become the object of state data spying. The EU must uphold and defend the principle of separation of powers and the separation of police, secret services and the military.
|93
? Data exchange between law enforcement authorities must be based on the rule of law and the rights of those affected must be strengthened. Data may only be exchanged in genuine cross-border investigations.
? We oppose blanket surveillance measures and blanket data exchange. Illegally acquired data may not be used in court proceedings in Germany and the EU.
? The numerous rulings of the European Court of Justice on the ban on data retention must finally be implemented.
The storage of passenger data without cause and the new entry and exit system for visa-free travelers must be abolished. With the Visa Information System, the Schengen Information System and the national PNR systems, the EU already has registers of over one hundred million people who have entered the EU in the past. Now data repositories with hundreds of millions more data records are being added: a new system for registering all persons who can enter the EU without a visa and a system in which all entries and the period of validity of entry and residence permits are stored. The data records contain all biometric data and are interlinked ("interoperability"). The police and intelligence services have access to this data. The sheer volume of this data alone makes formal data protection a farce.
Artificial intelligence applications are already being developed and used extensively in the areas of migration, asylum and border controls. Their use often leads to massive encroachments on the fundamental rights of those affected (right to privacy, data protection and procedural rights).
? We are therefore calling for a ban on AI-supported systems for individual risk assessment and risk profiling in the area of migration.
? AI-supported predictive analysis systems that are intended to prevent or restrict migration in the areas of migration, asylum and border control must be banned.
? We want to ban automated facial recognition and behavioral classification in public spaces.
? Hate crime and digital violence must be combated. We are committed to reporting and deleting. We reject chat controls.
? Anonymity on the Internet must be preserved. Age controls do not help to protect minors.
? New technologies such as artificial intelligence require third-party technology and fundamental rights impact assessments before new systems are introduced.
? We want to ban the export of surveillance technologies and technologies that can be used as weapons.
IT and data security
More and more processes are taking place digitally. Consumers and service providers (doctors, libraries, public authorities, etc.) are expected to use digital systems. The security of all IT products and thus the data they generate must not depend on the user's technical expertise or wallet. Rather, it is a social task to ensure the security of these systems and the data along the value chain in order to enable reliable data protection for all and prevent the digital divide from deepening even further.
94|
? Data security through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings (by design and by default) must be a condition of approval for the European market (i.e. in the default settings of hardware and software and in the development of software).
? Mandatory security updates for the lifetime of the devices are necessary. We want to increase the minimum warranty obligation to five years (depending on the type of device). Manufacturer-independent use and updates beyond the warranty period must be possible.
? We want to prohibit the purchase, sale and exploitation of security vulnerabilities in IT systems by intelligence services, police authorities, etc. IT security gaps must be closed in the interests of all.
? We want to decriminalize IT security research, i.e. hacking, if it is carried out for the purpose of improving IT security.
? We want to promote open source development: This allows security vulnerabilities to be identified and rectified more quickly. (See Chapter 2, "Freeing the Internet from the cores")
Ensuring digital participation for all
In rural areas, there is often no network because the nationwide expansion is not profitable for private providers. People run out of data volume because they don't have enough money. Or they don't have a smartphone on which they can securely store their private data. There are many reasons why digital services can make it difficult for people to participate in society. We want the social divide to be reduced rather than deepened!
? The telecommunications networks are already connected by the corporations. We want to transfer the infrastructure of the networks to a public, European institution. We want to use the resulting efficiency gains to expand the networks.
? Long warranty periods for technical devices make it easier for people with less money to use digital services safely. The costs for digital devices, connections and data volumes must be taken into account in the standard rates for basic income support.
? The EU's digital wallet project (EUid wallet) must not be implemented in a way that excludes people who cannot afford or do not want the latest mobile phones. The versions of the EUid wallet currently under discussion would not run on most of today's smartphones. Companies should not be allowed to prescribe the use of the digital wallet for their services; we reject such compulsory apps. (See chapter 5: "Data protection and protection against state surveillance")
? Further training on computer and Internet use must be offered and financed across the board.
? At the same time, we are campaigning for the right to an analog life. It must always be possible to submit non-digital applications to the authorities, make inquiries to customer service, get tickets for the swimming pool, the train or the cinema - without additional fees. People must be able to discuss their concerns with a human being and receive support in an uncomplicated way, especially at public offices, doctors and elsewhere.

Finally
In our election manifesto, we have formulated what needs to change for a Europe of the people instead of the banks and corporations. Every single one of the measures mentioned would be an improvement. All of them together require a fundamental restructuring, a system change. In the European Parliament, we will stand up for each of the demands and goals mentioned and fight for every possible improvement. We can only achieve a democratic Europe based on peace and social equality that overcomes the logic of profit and the politics of war together. This requires the commitment of each and every one of us. Let's go for it!

For a Europe of people, regions and nations in cultural diversity,
Peace and freedom.
Election program for the election to the European Parliament of the grassroots democratic party of Germany - dieBasis (as of 15.04.2024)
We distinguish between the European Union (EU) and Europe:
 Europe, which is a cultural, historically evolved geographical concept and living space, a continent that stretches from Portugal to the Urals, and
 The EU, which has developed into a supranational project driven primarily by economic and geopolitical interests, has become increasingly alienated from the people of this association of states and in some cases contradicts fundamental democratic principles and the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in the basic treaties.
Our party dieBasis stands like no other for grassroots democracy, direct democracy, active subsidiarity and regional decision-making structures - not only within Germany, but also within the EU. It is extremely important that our voices are heard and that we are no longer patronized when it comes to the highly controversial EU issues at present. That is why the grassroots are taking part in the EU elections on June 9, 2024. We want to turn democracy in the EU upside down and make the voice of the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany heard in the EU Parliament.
The people in the European Union are experiencing a progressive disenfranchisement and a weakening of national sovereignty rights while at the same time the decision-making power is being shifted to undemocratic, unelected EU institutions infiltrated by lobbyists. Year after year, new directives and regulations from Brussels reinforce the economic dominance of a few global corporations and elites. The socio-political effects of this cannot be overlooked. The gap between rich and poor and thus the social divide in the EU member states is becoming increasingly pronounced.
Not only is the low-wage sector growing rapidly, but the middle class is also currently under serious threat. Through its direct, massive military support for Ukraine and proximity to NATO, the EU is becoming a party to the conflict and the actual
"European peace project" at risk.
Our topics are democracy, peace, health, agriculture and nature, the environment, climate and energy, digital control, independent media, finance and cash, and migration.
I. For a grassroots democratic European Union - Giving the EU back to its citizens
The party dieBasis firmly rejects the status quo of the European Union (EU), which is perceived as undemocratic, and the efforts to transform the EU into a federal state (United States of Europe) with a binding EU constitution for the member states and the surrender of national sovereignty rights. dieBasis stands for subsidiarity and regional decision-making structures, for the participation of all citizens in important decisions, for EU-wide referendums, for the strengthening of citizens' rights and transparent decision-making processes in the EU.
More democracy is the core issue of Germany's grassroots democratic party for the upcoming EU parliamentary elections. The extent to which a juggernaut like the EU and its institutions can be reformed remains to be seen. According to a survey of members conducted in October 2023, many members of the dieBasis party can also imagine an orderly dissolution of the EU and a transition to a federation of sovereign states or even a DEXIT - especially if democratization and reform of the EU as a federation of states in the form of a significant reduction in the power of EU institutions and the creation of grassroots/direct democratic structures, as we outline below, is not possible.
? Fundamental change to EU structures and democratization of processes:
1. dieBasis calls for compliance with the principle of subsidiarity in the EU.
2. The sovereignty of the states must be respected and the different points of view and values of the countries must be respected.
People and companies in the EU are affected in many areas of everyday life by a flood of regulations and directives that lead to an immense bureaucratic burden and whose meaningfulness is becoming increasingly difficult to comprehend. The ever-increasing depth of regulation must be stopped. This means shifting legislative initiatives back to the small-scale (regional) decision-making structures of the nation states, unless the tasks in certain areas make a cooperation process appear more sensible (principle of subsidiarity).
3. The grassroots demand that the competences of the EU be reduced to a few essential areas.
reduce: Restrict to foreign and security policy, trade, financial and monetary policy.
The competences of the EU are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
At present, the EU has exclusive competence for the customs union, competition rules for the internal market, monetary policy for the eurozone countries, trade and international agreements (in certain cases).
In addition, there is so-called shared competence for the EU. This generally provides for the primacy of EU competence and now covers almost every area of daily life, resulting in a flood of regulations and directives whose depth of regulation affects every EU citizen.
In the sense of a self-determined and equal EU policy based on the principle of subsidiarity with regional decision-making structures, the competences via the EU treaties must be reduced to a few essential EU competences: e.g. customs union, competition rules for the internal market, monetary policy for the countries of the euro area, trade and international agreements (in certain cases), common foreign and security policy.
The areas to be transferred must be decided by the citizens of all member states.
4. National competences already transferred to the EU must not be passed on to transnational, partly private institutions.
Examples of this include: The World Health Organization (WHO) and free trade agreements such as CETA, TTIP and MERCOSUR.
5. With regard to the future of the EU Commission, the grassroots demand
a) the democratization of the EU Commission through the direct election of the Commission President.
The EU Commission is the "executive body". A direct election of the President of the European Commission by the citizens of the nation states would provide greater democratic legitimacy.
b) the creation of full transparency of decisions
of the EU Commission
Decisions of the EU Commission and their basis must be made public and comprehensible. We call for compliance with the provisions on full transparency in the Lisbon Treaty. This includes the listing of those involved as well as the disclosure of external consultants and any existing conflicts of interest. All legislative proposals and submissions on the respective topics must be documented and disclosed. Reasons must be given for whether or not these submissions are taken into account.
c) in the event of failure of a and b, the abolition of the EU Commission
The EU Commission should be dissolved if there appears to be no prospect of limiting its power and/or reforming it due to the considerable lack of transparency and democratic processes, its institutional independence and the influence of interest groups. The tasks of the EU Commission could then be transferred to the existing state bodies of the member states and, in part, to the European Parliament.
6. The distribution of seats in the EU Parliament must be proportional to the population.
Larger states generally have more MPs than smaller states, but smaller states have more MPs per inhabitant than larger states. This principle is known as "degressive proportionality". For example, Germany (83 million inhabitants) has 96 seats, i.e. one seat for every 811,000 inhabitants, Malta (0.4 million inhabitants) has
inhabitants) 6 seats, i.e. one seat for every 67,000 inhabitants. Proportionality (votes per inhabitant) should be significantly improved here in order to ensure a balanced representation of citizens' votes.
7. dieBasis demands the full legislative right of initiative of the EU Parliament.
One of the original tasks of a parliament is to submit draft legislation (right of initiative). The EU Parliament does not have this right of initiative. The EU Parliament must be given a full right of initiative in order to be able to represent the will of EU citizens.
8. dieBasis demands that the principle of unanimity of the member states be maintained.
Most laws and regulations in the EU require the approval of all member states. The major nations in the EU are thinking out loud about abolishing the unanimity principle for EU government votes. Even though it is becoming more and more difficult to reconcile these with an increasing number of member states and individual countries can block decisions, the principle of consensus and unanimity should not be abandoned from a grassroots democratic perspective, not least in order to limit the transatlantic influence (USA) on the EU.
9. dieBasis calls for the separation of powers to be respected in the EU.
The legislative (EU Parliament), executive (European Commission) and judiciary (European Court of Justice) as well as the media as a further supervisory body must be able to act independently of each other. The current one-sided power of the EU Commission must be dismantled. The control function of the EU Parliament vis-à-vis the EU Commission must be strengthened. The transfer of high-ranking representatives from one body to another, e.g. to the European Court of Justice, or to group boards or similar, is only permitted after a prior waiting period of five years.
10. No more costly moves of the European Parliament between two locations! Commitment to a fixed seat.
The seat of the European Parliament is Strasbourg, where twelve four-day plenary sessions are held each year. However, additional plenary sessions are currently also held in Brussels and the relocations cost millions. All parliamentary sessions must take place at a location to be determined by the EU citizens.
? Building grassroots democratic structures and empowering individual EU citizens:
11. dieBasis calls for the targeted promotion of EU-wide referendums on important issues and referendums.
dieBasis demands and supports EU-wide referendums as a means of grassroots/direct democracy.
12. dieBasis calls for a right of initiative for EU citizens by strengthening the ECI.
With a European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), EU citizens can propose legal acts in areas that fall within the competence of the EU. The party dieBasis supports the implementation of ECIs and calls for the ECI to be upgraded through a right of initiative and a significant reduction in the disproportionately high quorums (1 million signatures from a quarter of the EU states). Significant changes to the treaties are required here in order to simplify the procedure. Until the treaty amendments are implemented, theBasis will support European citizens' initiatives in their implementation.
13. dieBasis supports the establishment of a network of grassroots democratic parties in Europe.
dieBasis aims to strengthen grassroots democracy in all EU member states by actively promoting cooperation with parties and movements with similar objectives.
? The party's activities within the EU Parliament
14. With its presence in the EU Parliament, theBasis will create more transparency about EU structures and processes for the citizens of the member states.
One of the main tasks of our EU parliamentarians will be to make the democratic deficits and undesirable developments within the current EU structure clear to the public and to demand grassroots democratic solutions. This begins with information about the structures and processes in the EU.
15. With its presence in the EU Parliament, theBasis will ensure that citizens are informed about proposed legislation in good time.
16. Draft legislation must be published early and in full.
Our parliamentarians will make planned directives and regulations available to the public on the Internet as quickly as possible in order to create the greatest possible transparency and present all the advantages and disadvantages. The deadline for the
The period for taking note of bills must be sufficient in relation to the complexity of the bill, but at least two weeks, so that parliamentarians can deal with it responsibly.
17. We fundamentally reject laws in the omnibus procedure.
The term "omnibus procedure" is used when different issues are combined into one process and voted on as a package. The intention of the omnibus procedure is to hide parts of a bill in another bill. the grassroots parliamentarians will make such procedures public.
18. dieBasis will publicize and, if possible, prevent the abuse of power and the acceptance of advantages through lobbying.
So far, it has been like this: "The economy sets the direction and politics clears the way". dieBasis demands strict control of lobbying in order to prevent abuse of power and manipulation. Instead of a one-sided orientation of the EU towards economic and lobbying interests, we want a clear focus on the common good and fundamental rights and freedoms.
? EU enlargement:
19. An enlargement of the EU may only take place via referendums both in the accession country and in the existing EU countries.
20. dieBasis is against a geopolitically motivated enlargement of the EU.
The whether and how of EU enlargement must meet the needs of both the people in the accession states and the people in the member states, must be decided by them and must not be dominated by the geopolitical interests of global players (e.g. the USA).
II. For a foreign and security policy that promotes peace
The party dieBasis will also act as the party of peace in the EU and campaign for détente and peace in Europe and the world. dieBasis is the only party in Germany that demands military neutrality by withdrawing from NATO and banning foreign military forces, including nuclear weapons and military bases such as the Ramstein war hub, as a prerequisite for the lasting peaceful coexistence of all countries, states and peoples of the world.
dieBasis respects the free self-determination, territorial integrity, political independence and equal rights of all states, as formulated in the principles of the UN Charter of the United Nations and in international law. In our international relations, we advocate fair multilateral cooperation.
This results in the following program points for the EU parliamentary elections.
1. The militaristic character of the EU, with its ties to NATO, its commitment to rearmament, the abrogation of the right to life in the event of a riot or insurrection and the waging of wars for the sake of the interests of the people, must be recognized.
to overcome the threat to our senses.
The EU has taken on an increasingly militaristic character, and not just since the war in Ukraine. It is closely intertwined with NATO1 within the framework of the common security and defense policy and joint defense projects. In the EU Treaty, Article 42, paragraph 3, the Member States commit themselves to gradually improving their military capabilities2 . In the explanations to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, a killing
"shall not be regarded as a violation of the Article on the right to life if it is caused by the use of force which is strictly necessary to put down, for example, a riot or insurrection lawfully".3 According to the Treaty on European Union (TEU), Article 42, paragraph 5, the Council "may entrust a group of Member States with the implementation of a mission within the framework of the Union in order to safeguard the Union's values and serve its interests"4 .
2. The party dieBasis fundamentally rejects sanctions and boycotts as a means of political conflict resolution.
Sanctions cause material damage and, in some cases, serious suffering for the civilian population. In Iraq, Iran and Syria (to name just a few countries), we have been able to observe the terrible consequences for the people living there for years.
Economic sanctions are part of a ruthless warfare that we reject.
The countries of this world are all part of a global community of nations that wants to cooperate economically and culturally in mutual respect for different social models. The principles to be observed in this respect were laid down in the United Nations Charter after the Second World War and are binding under international law. However, the population of a country must not be "punished" for the political actions of its government.
3. Dialogue and the overcoming of camp and bloc thinking must be promoted.
4. dieBasis calls for the dismantling of enemy stereotypes that serve to legitimize geopolitical conflicts and wars.
5. dieBasis calls for the EU to work to end wars through de-escalation and diplomacy.

Bloc thinking inevitably leads to escalating conflicts and alienation instead of rapprochement and peace. The almost forgotten ten principles of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) for regulating bilateral relations must be brought back to life. These principles include
including the peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, respect for the equal rights and self-determination of peoples and the fulfillment of obligations under international law. The ever closer connection between the EU and NATO only promotes bloc thinking and is therefore rejected by the dieBasis party.
6. The party dieBasis is committed to a European security policy in which the security interests of all states must be recognized equally.
7. DieBasis calls for an increase in European funding for peace research and international understanding instead of arms exports.
The party dieBasis rejects war in general and especially as a means of enforcing interests. Conflicts of interest between states must be resolved by diplomatic means. TheBasis party advocates an immediate stop to all arms deliveries from the EU to crisis and war zones.
Instead, we need a return to a policy of détente, disarmament treaties and an increase in funding for peace research and international understanding.
A first de-escalating step in the Ukraine conflict should be diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict peacefully instead of continuing to pursue the logic of military escalation.
8. The party dieBasis demands the establishment of an independent international investigation committee on Nordstream 1+2.
9. dieBasis advocates negotiations and cooperation with Russia for the early resumption of gas supplies via the intact pipe of the Nordstream II pipeline.
The party dieBasis advocates that the responsible investigative authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, if possible together with the neighboring states and the EU, start investigations to find out who destroyed or severely damaged the three Nordstream 1+2 pipelines in September 2022, which are essential for securing cheap energy in the Federal Republic of Germany and the EU. To this end, an independent international committee of inquiry must be set up, with the involvement of Russia and the USA. Those responsible must be held accountable and the repairable pipelines must be put back into operation as quickly as possible.
III. People at the center of the healthcare system
? General topics on the healthcare system in the EU
The EU's tendency to hand over more and more powers to non-democratically elected organizations that are beyond parliamentary control also applies to the healthcare sector and must be stopped. The healthcare sector in particular is affected by the expansion of the digitalization of personal, highly sensitive data and its use for research in the digital health space across the EU. This is intended to facilitate the exchange of health data between medical institutions and healthcare providers in different EU countries. The planned European Digital Health Data Space (EHDS)5 refers to the primary and secondary use of health data. Primary use refers to the digitization of health data (electronic patient file), which also includes the planned digital vaccination certificate for travel.
Secondary use of data refers to the potential uses for science and research for political control and regulation. This results in the following general positions on the European healthcare system:
1. dieBasis wants to leave health-related regulations and measures in the exclusive competence of the respective EU member state.
2. dieBasis calls for the transfer of health-related competencies already transferred to the EU back to the member states.
3. We reject the "digital health space".
4. Health data is personal and only relevant in the patient-doctor relationship. This data may only be passed on to third parties ("primary and secondary use") (even anonymized) with individual consent.
5. We reject a mandatory digital EU health passport (e.g. as a travel document) and a mandatory electronic patient file.
6. dieBasis is against the automated transfer of private health data to research institutions and the pharmaceutical industry for data protection reasons and to ensure that personal rights are protected.
? WHO
Since it was founded in Geneva in 1948, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been active worldwide as a specialized agency of the United Nations for the promotion of public health and the collection of data on serious diseases. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO has come under international scrutiny, at the latest due to the recommendation of inadequately tested
"Vaccines" have also come under criticism.
The WHO is largely financed by earmarked donations from influential organizations and special government payments. In 2022, for example, according to the WHO's financial report, only around 11% of funds came from mandatory contributions from member states, everything else was voluntary contributions, including $597 million from Germany and $193 million from the EU. The largest private sponsor of the WHO, with $390 million and just under 10% of the WHO's total funding, is the private Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is a major investor in the pharmaceutical industry, among others. These donations are generally earmarked and primarily finance vaccination campaigns, polio programs and emergency aid in the event of cholera outbreaks, for example.
7. Financial and personal links between the EU, WHO and the pharmaceutical industry must be disclosed.
8. dieBasis calls for the EU to stop providing financial support to the WHO.
9. Partially privately financed organizations must not be allowed to determine the health of citizens.
10. The WHO must not be used as an instrument for private interests.
5 https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space_de
11. The WHO must no longer be exempt from control and liability for the negative consequences of its recommendations for action - drugs, vaccines, mRNA technologies and treatment protocols.
The WHO is currently working on an international pandemic treaty, which is intended to transfer national competencies to the WHO in the event of a self-proclaimed pandemic. The definition of a pandemic, together with the definition of vaccination and herd immunity, was arbitrarily changed by the WHO in 2009 without scientific justification. In the definition of a pandemic, both the severity of the course of the disease and the mortality rate are no longer prerequisites for declaring a pandemic. According to the WHO, a pandemic is a situation in which the global population is potentially exposed to a "new" pathogen and there is a risk that some of them will fall ill. With the international pandemic treaty, member states would in future be bound by the respective measures decreed by the WHO, regardless of national legislation. This includes mandatory vaccination campaigns, medication regulations and lockdowns. Germany and the EU support the introduction of such a global pandemic treaty. In view of this seriously dangerous development in the WHO, the following demands arise for the grassroots:
12. The national sovereignty of states must not be restricted by the WHO (e.g. through a pandemic treaty).
13. The WHO must not declare a global health emergency with mandatory measures.
14. The WHO is not allowed to prescribe mandatory vaccinations, therapies or medication.
15. The WHO should continue to only advise the countries, but may not prescribe and implement any mandatory health measures in the countries.
16. The citizens of the member states are to be asked to approve the pandemic treaty in a referendum.
17. dieBasis calls on the WHO to return to the original definition of a pandemic.
18. dieBasis calls for Germany to leave the WHO.
19. Under the current conditions, the grassroots are calling for the WHO to be dissolved and replaced by an independent institution that is not commercially and politically instrumentalized.
? I.H.R. - (International Health Regulations) International Health Regulations of the WHO
In addition to the submission of the pandemic treaty, at the request of the USA (2022), the
I.H.R. from 2005 and adapted to current circumstances. These guidelines are legally binding. They are intended to give the WHO decision-making authority in the areas of business, trade and travel, even in climate-related crisis situations, as far as is known and subject to the approval of the member states. The WHO assumes that all areas of life must be included in the IHR.
20. Fundamental and human rights must apply unconditionally - even in times of emergency.
21. dieBasis calls for the WHO to be denied the right to a higher legal system that places itself above national law and can, for example, override the Basic Law.
22. Article 2, para. 2 of the German Basic Law regarding the integrity of the body is inviolable and should not be able to be repealed by the WHO.
23. In Germany, health policy is the responsibility of the federal states and is carried out in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity in coordination with each other and with the recommendation of the Federal Ministry of Health. This federal structure must be maintained.
24. The WHO must not be able to declare a "climate emergency".
25. The power that the sovereign has transferred to the parliaments and governments of nation states through elections must not be passed on to undemocratic organizations such as the WHO.
? COVID-19 pandemic measures
To date, there has been no review of the measures and mistakes made during the coronavirus pandemic at EU level. So far, neither the pharmaceutical industry nor those responsible have been held accountable. In particular, Commission President von der Leyen's arbitrary decisions regarding the procurement of Covid-19 "vaccines" and possible allegations of corruption in this context have not been clarified either politically or legally.
26. The pharmaceutical industry must not be exempt from liability for medicines, vaccines and medical products.
27. The politicians and officials responsible must be held accountable for deliberately wrong decisions.
28. dieBasis is calling for a "Nuremberg 2.0" court case to review the measures taken in connection with the coronavirus pandemic and their consequences.
29. We call for a complete and transparent investigation into the suspicions of corruption against the European Commission and the Commission President.
30. In the event of demonstrable, deliberate criminal acts and gross negligence in connection with the coronavirus pandemic and the measures implemented, those responsible must be charged.
? European Medicines Agency EMA
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is an agency of the European Union. The task of the EMA, by definition, is to ensure the scientific evaluation, monitoring and safety assessment of medicinal products for human and veterinary use in the EU. It is 86% funded by fees and charges from the pharmaceutical industry and only 14% from EU funds, making it susceptible to lobbying and corruption by the pharmaceutical industry. Like the WHO, however, the EMA has far-reaching powers that affect the health of all EU citizens.
31. dieBasis firmly rejects drug and vaccine approval via the EMA, which is 86% funded by the pharmaceutical industry.
32. dieBasis calls for drug and vaccine approval exclusively at national level.
? Responsible handling of radio radiation
Electrical devices, wireless technologies and power lines generate electromagnetic fields (EMF) whose harmful effects on the health of humans, animals and plants have been proven by studies worldwide, but this is still the subject of controversial debate. There is an increasing number of electro-hypersensitive people who feel that their health is impaired by radio exposure and are therefore no longer able to participate in public life and only to a limited extent in working life. With the spread of EMF-based radio technologies, i.e. more and more cell phones, WLAN and other wireless devices, the exposure
even increase due to electrosmog.
33. dieBasis advocates independent scientific studies on the effects of increasing exposure to electrosmog on humans, animals and plants and the setting of appropriate limits in the EU.
34. dieBasis is committed to the precautionary reduction of radio pollution in public spaces, hotels and means of transportation to protect biosystems from oxidative stress; especially to protect children and electrohypersensitives.
35. dieBasis is committed to low-radio living spaces (e.g. in public rail transport, hospitals, public authorities) so that electrohypersensitives can participate in public life again.
36. dieBasis is committed to greater consumer protection for electronic devices, in that WLAN must be self-determined, easy and visible to switch off, and operating instructions must provide explanations.
IV. For healthy agriculture and an intact natural environment
The recent farmers' protests in Germany, but also in the Netherlands, France and other European countries have shown this: The completely misguided EU agricultural policy with its countless regulations and subsidies is at an end and is no longer supported by those affected. dieBasis takes the concerns and proposals of farmers and consumers seriously and will bring them to the EU Parliament.
The EU's environmental and agricultural policy must be fundamentally redefined and shaped according to the principle of subsidiarity.
Alignment with social and human goals
Our aim is to produce our own staple foods in the EU on the basis of natural soil fertility and species- appropriate animal husbandry, and to nurture and care for our established cultural landscapes.
The main concern of the dieBasis party is to support and develop local people, rural agriculture, regional structures and a circular economy that is as complete as possible.
Instead of aligning the common agricultural policy with the corporate interests of the agricultural and food industry and climate lobbyists, we are calling for decentralized and diverse solutions that are developed together by consumers and farmers in a personal exchange on the ground and offer prospects for organic and conventional farmers.
Education and research in the service of people and nature are important building blocks in this respect, in order to give consumers and farmers the tools to make free and well-informed decisions about their food and farming practices.
Demands for animal welfare, healthy nutrition, nature conservation and sustainable forestry complete our program.
? De-bureaucratization:
1. The mis/over-regulation and excessive bureaucracy to which farmers in the EU are exposed must be reduced.
2. Control and administrative tasks must not be shifted to agricultural producers.
3. There must be no reversal of the burden of proof - the farmers should get out of the role of suspects who always have to prove that they are innocent.
Increasingly complicated regulations, such as the Fertilizer Ordinance, animal welfare regulations and regulations on land promotion, have created a web of rules that is difficult to understand and implement. However, the intended protection of consumers, groundwater, animal welfare and biodiversity cannot be achieved through ever more bans and controls as well as contradictory and counterproductive regulations. The excessive bureaucracy has led to farmers spending more and more time on administrative and documentation tasks in the office, which they then lack for their actual work in the fields and stables.
As a result, small farmers in particular are being driven to give up.
4. Digitalization must not lead to disadvantages for those affected.
Without computers and the Internet, it is no longer possible to meet all administrative requirements. We are in favour of the efficient use of digitalization. However, farmers should be free to decide for themselves what is used on their farms. It must still be possible to farm without digital equipment.
5. We reject the monitoring of companies by AI and satellites.
Current developments, such as the seamless monitoring of fields by AI and satellite- supported systems, which are also very error-prone, are leading to less and less freedom of choice. Farmers feel increasingly constrained.
6. Constant changes to specifications jeopardize the planning security of companies and should therefore be avoided.
As the rules are also changed abruptly every few years, it is almost impossible to plan for the future, as investments, e.g. in new stables, need a reliable basis. It is becoming increasingly difficult for small farms in particular to find new and innovative solutions.
? Decentralization:
7. The farmers and consumers affected should have a real say in legislative decisions and regulations at EU level.
8. EU-wide directives and regulations should only create framework conditions; as many decisions as possible should be made locally / by the lowest responsible decision-making bodies
9. The influence of large corporations and industry as well as unelected
The influence of lobbyists must be pushed back and limited with clear rules.
The "European Green Deal" or the "Farm-to-Fork" program are pure products of the EU administration, which are rejected by the party dieBasis. The content of the regulations is only ever coordinated at the various levels of administration down to the level of the federal states, represented by the respective ministries. There is no democratic process involving the active participation of various parliaments or even the farmers and consumers affected. Representing farmers and consumers would require associations that are organized independently and democratically. Instead, numerous interest groups, non-governmental organizations and lobbyists in Brussels are involved in the development and design of agricultural and environmental policies and implementation programmes.
10. Focusing agriculture on the food sovereignty of the population in the EU and only secondarily on the world market.
Extremely low world market prices have meant that farmers have become the big losers in this system. Global trading groups, the agrochemical industry, food companies and stock market speculators are the main beneficiaries of the world market. We want to redirect these cash flows, ensure that the EU is fully self-sufficient in food and ensure significantly higher producer prices without a major increase in consumer prices. Agricultural products that are highly subsidized in the EU may no longer be exported in this form, as they displace local agricultural products in the target countries.
11. If there are support programs, then the promotion of the local circular economy and small, regional structures in food production and marketing.
dieBasis focuses on structures that are as small-scale as possible, grassroots democratic decisions and more personal responsibility on the part of farmers and consumers. The shorter the path from farmer to consumer, the fewer bureaucratic hurdles there should be.
? Future prospects for farmers:
12. dieBasis is committed to the preservation of rural agriculture.
13. Land grabbing by large investors must be stopped.
14. dieBasis calls for a move away from the system of agricultural support (subsidies) towards fair pricing for agricultural products.
Many independent farmers and a broad distribution of ownership, including in agriculture, are the guarantee of our food sovereignty. Land grabbing by agricultural corporations and large investors does not only exist in the Global South, but also in our country and endangers our peasant agriculture.
EU agricultural subsidies are the largest single item in the budget. The EU pumps billions into agriculture, but it mainly supports landowners and large farms. We therefore want EU subsidies for large investors to be capped and instead advocate an expansion of support for small farms producing for the regional market. The dieBasis party questions the current EU agricultural policy and advocates fundamental changes in the direction of cost- covering producer prices that value the services of farmers and less state support for large agricultural businesses.
As long as the subsidy system remains in place, we are against further cuts for smaller farms without the additional costs being passed on to consumers via prices.
In the long term, we intend to make state subsidies for agricultural businesses superfluous and instead find solutions that also enable small businesses to make a living from their products and services for society (landscape conservation).
15. Imported food must meet EU standards.
16. No free trade agreements (e.g. TTIP, CETA, MERCOSUR), but on the contrary protective tariffs on goods that can also be produced in the domestic market.
We only want to trade freely with companies and countries that produce to our social and ecological standards. Current free trade agreements such as CETA and MERCOSUR are designed in such a way that they only bring disadvantages for farmers, consumers and the environment. As a result, cheap products from abroad are forcing their way onto the domestic market, some of which are produced using pesticides that have been banned in the EU for decades, have been genetically modified or are produced under inhumane working conditions. Under these circumstances, domestic agriculture cannot be competitive.
17. The grassroots demand that agricultural land (fields, meadows and pastures) be preserved for food production.
18. The services for the preservation of the cultural landscape should be adequately remunerated.
19. Farmers' seed autonomy, i.e. free access to seed even without license and reproduction fees, must be guaranteed.
20. There must be no patents on nature, i.e. plants, animals and seeds.
Instead of becoming increasingly dependent on foreign countries in the area of food production, as is already the case with energy supply and the supply of medicines, we are in favor of strengthening agriculture and thus preserving our diverse and small-scale cultural landscape. This also includes the breeding of
and adapted local varieties as well as the preservation of old crop varieties and animal breeds and the preservation of pasture farming. Farmers must not become dependent on agricultural corporations that patent plants bred using new genetic engineering techniques. Without meadows and fields, a large part of our diverse flora and fauna will also disappear!
21. We reject the use of genetically modified organisms, in particular genome editing with new methods such as CRISPR/Cas.
22. dieBasis demands the safeguarding of GMO-free cultivation and organic plant breeding.
According to current regulations, old and new genetic engineering is subject to EU approval. This guarantees a risk assessment for human health and the environment, transparency for manufacturers and farmers and clear labeling for consumers. dieBasis rejects the EU's deregulation of genetic engineering. Under this proposal, the vast majority of plants that have been genetically modified using novel genetic engineering techniques would simply be waved through onto the market - without any approval procedure, without risk assessment and without labeling! This would prevent farmers, food producers, retailers and every single citizen from choosing GMO-free products.
The new genetic engineering is neither sustainable, nor does it reduce pesticides or protect the climate. Rather, it is about massively increasing corporate profits, as plants bred using new genetic engineering can be patented and varieties are reduced to a few genetically monotonous species with copyright protection.
The genetically modified plants would be released into the environment in an uncontrollable and irreversible manner, without even the slightest research into the possible ecological and health consequences.
23. We are against photovoltaic systems on arable land unless the land can still be used for agriculture.
Fertile arable land should generally be used for food production and not for energy generation. Photovoltaic systems on arable land and meadows can only be considered as an exception if the technology used (e.g. agrophotovoltaics) does not restrict the agricultural use of the land and does not destroy the landscape.
? Consumer protection, nutrition:
24. There is a need for honest and comprehensive food labeling as a basis for informed purchasing decisions.
25. dieBasis calls for the transparent labeling of food, especially when animal ingredients, including insects, are added and when genetically modified feed is used.
26. dieBasis is against artificial meat and vegetable production from laboratories, factories and 3D printers ("vertical farming", synthetic laboratory meat).
27. Food security in the EU must be guaranteed within the EU without dependence on foreign countries.
Politics must not dictate what we have to eat. We want to create framework conditions that enable us to do without industrially produced food. Healthy, minimally processed organic products and
Responsibly produced conventional products are more expensive than mass-produced, highly processed food made with cheap additives. If the damage to society and nature were also taken into account, the cost ratio would probably be reversed. The internal market must be regulated in such a way that healthy, natural food reaches the consumer via short transportation routes. The origin of the food and the quality of production should be clearly and easily recognizable.
Consumers must be able to choose products that meet their expectations of a healthy diet or species-appropriate animal husbandry, even without extensive prior knowledge.
28. VAT on unprocessed basic foodstuffs from the internal market is to be set to zero.
29. By promoting direct marketing, the aim is to reduce the increase in food prices caused by intermediate trade and speculation and to ensure that more of the food is produced by the producer.
remain.
30. Food must not be an object of speculation.
Food needs more appreciation and higher prices for producers, but must also remain affordable. Price increases can be counteracted by shortening trade routes, reducing intermediate trade, lowering VAT and banning speculation on food on world market exchanges.
? Animal welfare:
31. Industrial, especially cruel factory farming should be abolished.
32. Cheap imports of mass-produced animal products should be prevented.
33. dieBasis supports the promotion of pasture farming.
34. The transportation of live animals in and out of the EU should be stopped.
35. We reject compulsory vaccinations and mRNA vaccinations in livestock farming.
36. Homeopathic applications in animal husbandry must remain possible without restriction.
The members of the dieBasis party are concerned not to cause unnecessary suffering to the animal world and to live together in peaceful coexistence with wild and domestic animals.
Domestic livestock farming is currently competing with cheap production abroad, which has led to a compulsion to produce more and more on less and less land. Excesses such as cruel breeding, e.g. of turkeys with huge breasts or cows with extremely large udders, have also resulted from this pressure to produce more and more cheaply. Higher standards of animal welfare, which are desired by many consumers, can only be realized by the farms if the products produced with more effort also find buyers. Buyers have a responsibility here. As long as they only pay attention to the price when shopping, nothing can change. We would therefore like to see a higher appreciation of animal products in the future, so that more animal-friendly husbandry becomes possible. As our fellow creatures, animals deserve respect and care. With species-appropriate animal husbandry, fewer vaccinations and medicines are needed. The profession of veterinary practitioner and naturopathic and homeopathic therapies for animals should be preserved.
? Nature conservation:
37. The use of pesticides and artificial fertilizers is to be restricted to defined limits.
38. dieBasis is committed to promoting the conversion to organic farming.
39. dieBasis is committed to promoting research into innovative agricultural cultivation methods (such as permaculture).
40. The authorization for glyphosate must be withdrawn.
41. Technological innovations are to be developed and traditional fertilization and plant protection methods are to be revived in order to offer alternatives to the use of pesticides and artificial fertilizers.
42. Independent research is needed to determine the actual impact of the
agricultural methods and inputs on nature, biodiversity, the environment and health.
What consumers and society want from agriculture is very clear: biodiversity, the cultivated landscape and natural resources such as fertile soil, clean water and healthy forests should be preserved. However, unilateral bans, more and more laws and more precise regulations are not the right way to achieve these goals. No farmer will intentionally harm nature and animals. We need to create a framework that enables farmers to farm in harmony with nature. Research and education in the service of people and nature are important building blocks in this respect, in order to give consumers and farmers the tools to make free and well-informed decisions about their food and farming practices.
43. The consumption and sealing of land through development must be greatly reduced. be restricted so as not to further reduce the areas available for nature and agriculture.
Until now, this issue has been the responsibility of the nation states. For some years now, the EU has been addressing this issue in various strategies. The envisaged restoration of ecosystems is to be welcomed in principle. However, instead of depriving agriculture of land for nature conservation across the board through the planned permanent set-aside of 4% of all farmland (even though the regulation has been suspended for 2023 and 2024), differentiation should be made according to farm size (with an exception for small farms) and the pressure of urban and industrial land expansion on agriculture should be reduced.
44. Drinking water is a fundamental right. There must be no privatization of water rights.
45. Drinking water supply must take precedence over industrial use and economic interests.
46. Water supply and disposal as a public service belong in municipal hands and must not be operated for profit.
47. We are calling for more sustainable water management: when extracting and using water, it must be ensured that the groundwater table and the natural water cycle are maintained.
? Forest
48. Pristine natural forests require special protection.
Natural forests that are still largely intact must be preserved and given special protection. The undermining of nature conservation under the alibi of climate protection, such as
e.g. for the erection of wind turbines in the Reinhardswald in Hesse.
49. Forest policy should be a matter for nation states, as the heterogeneity means that there are no generally applicable rules, such as uniform regulations for deforestation- free forests.
supply chains can apply in the EU (subsidiarity principle).
Until mid-2023, forests were not a resource that was over-regulated by EU regulations. And it should remain so, as forest management in Germany and most European countries largely complies with the principles of sustainable forest management.
With the new EU Forest Strategy 2030 as part of the Green Deal
However, the EU's forestry policy provides for restrictions on the diversity of forest management by means of large-scale external utilization, restrictions on timber harvesting and interventions in property rights. dieBasis supports sustainable forest management by foresters and forest farmers and rejects EU interference in forest management apart from incentives for natural regeneration and afforestation in regions of the EU with low forest cover.
V. Environmental protection, services of general interest and openness to technology instead of climate ideology
For many years, politicians and the media have been talking and writing about the fact that global warming is leading to a climate catastrophe for humanity and the planet. The EU - especially Germany - once again wants to be a pioneer for solutions. The climate argument is used to justify all nonsensical and inhumane measures. In the EU, this is called
"Green Deal".
Nature is the indispensable basis of our existence. We are therefore not only morally obliged to treat it respectfully and sustainably. We want a healthy life in harmony with nature, with stable ecosystems and great biodiversity. We respect and preserve creation. Unlike at present, we want to establish a different economic model for the future that works according to the cradle-to-cradle principle: It produces durable, fully recyclable or biodegradable products. Disposable and throwaway packaging will be converted to an environmentally friendly circular economy. All technologies used in public and private spaces are comprehensively tested and must be harmless to health and the environment.
However, since the so-called "Green Deal" at the latest, almost every policy in the EU, including environmental policy, has been placed under the primacy of climate protection and the reduction of CO2 emissions. This goes hand in hand with far-reaching interventions in the energy industry, companies and private households. Insufficient attention is being paid to real environmental protection and energy consumption is being demonized.
An environmentally friendly energy supply is a public service!
Today's man-made energy is a limited resource and consists of fossil and renewable components. Every form of energy production is also associated with adverse effects on our environment.
 Fossil fuels damage the environment as soon as they are extracted and emit large quantities of gases (CO2, methane, etc.), which are blamed for global warming, as well as pollutants during transportation and combustion.
 The use of nuclear energy, as a risk technology, can be compared with fossil fuels, as fuel extraction (uranium, thorium) and nuclear waste disposal are associated with considerable environmental pollution (including CO2).
 So-called regenerative energy resources are also only available to a limited extent and their excessive exploitation also damages the environment, nature and society and may compete with food production.
? Our approach to the climate narrative
Since the coronavirus crisis at the latest, many people have begun to doubt the objectivity and credibility of science. The climate change narrative is repeated to us like a mantra. Anyone who is skeptical is quickly defamed as a "climate denier". On the one hand, there are those who consider humans, their lifestyles and the emissions of industrialization based on fossil fuels to be responsible, deriving from this a catastrophic scenario of climate change for humanity and calling for correspondingly radical countermeasures, including encroachments on civil liberties. On the other hand, there are those who doubt that the available data can prove that humans are solely responsible for global warming and question the appropriateness and effectiveness of the planned countermeasures.
The dieBasis party is well aware of the phenomenon of "global warming" and that human activity (e.g. deforestation, soil sealing) also contributes to it. However, we do not follow the common narrative of man-made climate change through CO2 emissions. Ultimately, it seems to us that the influence of humans is very limited. On the other hand
The grassroots see a great danger that the CO2 narrative will be used to dismantle democracy and civil liberties and to levy new taxes.
1. dieBasis calls for a balanced scientific reassessment of the development of the global climate, including consultation with scientists who cannot confirm the CO2 thesis.
On the subject of "climate", a distinction must be made between weather phenomena and large-scale and long-term changes to the global climate. The former is countered with small-scale interventions in the weather (e.g. inoculating clouds with silver iodide), the latter with adaptation to climate change or large-scale technological interventions in the atmosphere (geoengineering). The grassroots have three demands:
2. theBasis rejects targeted manipulative interventions in the weather.
3. The grassroots reject geoengineering (e.g. solar dimming) to influence the climate.
4. Preserving forests, wetlands (e.g. moors) and marine ecosystems (e.g. coral reefs) is the best way to help protect our climate.
Livelihoods.
? General requirements in the field of energy and the environment - the target quadrangle of the energy industry: ecological, regional, affordable and reliable supply
Energy supply is part of public services of general interest and should therefore be open to technology and free of ideology. As energy supply can lead to monopolies for technical reasons, operations and profits must be regulated by the state. In the past, a successful energy policy has always focused on a compromise in the so-called target triangle of price, environment and security of supply (see Fig. 1). This means that all alternatives must be evaluated according to many criteria, not just the issue of "CO2=climate". An energy transition that promises climate neutrality but at the same time ignores price, security of supply and geopolitics will fail.
Fig.1: The classic triangle of energy supply objectives. The three aspects of price, environment and security of supply must all be considered equally (left).
Fig.2: Desired expansion of the target triangle to include the "regionality" dimension to form a target quadrangle (right).
TheBasis also suggests adding regionality as a fourth dimension to the target triangle, as on the one hand we want to reduce the influence of large energy companies for reasons of power control
and, on the other hand, believe that an additional regional component makes our society less dependent on geopolitical currents and terrorist attacks (see Nordstream 2). It also strengthens the circular economy and reduces the transportation of goods. This results in a target quadrangle (see Fig. 2).
Nuclear power is a risky technology that pollutes the environment. On the other hand, it could be a necessary complement to renewable energies, at least in a transitional period. The topic is still the subject of controversial debate within the party dieBasis. Some members support the further development of the peaceful use of nuclear power for energy generation in Europe through new, safer and decentralized technologies. Others are in favor of a consistent Europe-wide phase-out of nuclear energy. That is why this program does not contain a position on this. Nuclear power yes or no is definitely an issue that should be decided in a referendum.
Last but not least: the biggest consumer of energy, environmental and climate pollutant is war policy due to the destruction and emissions caused by the military in wars. As a peace party, we are doing a double good in this sense.
The following general requirements are formulated, taking into account the complex interrelationships of a target quadrangle.
5. dieBasis demands environmental protection instead of climate ideology.
6. Environmental protection and so-called "climate protection" must not be enforced against fundamental vital interests (e.g. of farmers). A fair balance of interests is important.
7. Measures to protect the environment and adapt to changing climatic conditions Conditions must be negotiated at regional and municipal level for the mutual benefit of people and nature.
8. The top priority for the energy supply must be a secure, reliable, environmentally friendly and affordable energy supply for citizens and industry.
9. Energy production should generally be based on the principle of cooperation rather than ideological confrontation.
10. dieBasis is striving for energy autonomy in the EU as a long-term goal.
11. is the basis for decentralized energy generation.
12. The energy supply must be committed to the common good.
13. Municipal/state and private energy producers should be treated equally.
14. Energy production and research into alternative energy sources have a major impact on The development of new technologies must be carried out on an engineering-
scientific basis and open to all technologies in accordance with the target quadrangle.
15. dieBasis is against the EU's plan to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.
16. dieBasis rejects the setting of rigid phase-out dates at the expense of technically well thought-out and economically sound solution concepts.
17. dieBasis calls for the promotion of regional energy production and isolated solutions depending on technological possibilities.
18. The production of bioenergy must not be at the expense of land for food production.
19. dieBasis is against the expansion of wind energy at the expense of landscape protection, health, nature and groundwater.
20. dieBasis calls for a consistent peace policy, peaceful coexistence with global disarmament as essential steps towards security of supply,
Conservation of resources and environmental protection. (See also peace and security policy)
21. dieBasis is committed to the repair and recommissioning of the Nord Stream gas supply pipelines. (See also thematic block II. Peace and security policy)
? Regulation of the energy sector - reducing bureaucracy
Until the 1990s, the energy industry was a market characterized by minimal state regulation (the Energy Industry Act (EnWG) had 8 pages), which ensured a cheap and secure supply of electricity and gas. Increasing government intervention (deregulation, EEG, nuclear phase-out, coal phase- out) has turned it into a bureaucratic jungle that is difficult to navigate (today the EnWG has around 150 pages), from which investors are the main beneficiaries.
All that has remained is a sham market with the merit order process, which has also deliberately excluded the cheapest power plants from the race. In recent years, the thicket of rules has led to lobbyists, climate hysterics and EU bureaucrats exerting too much influence on energy policy. The "engineering solutions" of the transition have given customers the highest electricity prices in the world. Instead of a one-sided focus on "CO2 avoidance", we must return to a target triangle or even a target quadrangle (see above).
The generally applied CO2 accounting is counterproductive and places a one-sided burden on European companies. Firstly, the CO2 costs are partly reimbursed via subsidies to export-oriented companies, and secondly, production is relocated to Asia and America, where it generates even more CO2. This is why CO2 certificate trading has no real impact on the climate, even if we are convinced that it is harmful to the climate. We also reject initiatives such as the CBAM Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/956) to create a CO2 border adjustment system for imports from outside the EU. It would mean that from 2026, private individuals would also be affected, e.g. for vacation souvenirs with a value of 150
would have to buy additional CO2 certificates.
22. The rules in the energy sector must become concise and transparent again.
23. dieBasis is calling for the EU climate regulations to be thinned out and revised, with no blanket paternalism, and for obstacles to regional and situation-specific solutions to be removed.
24. The competition rules and regulations that stand in the way of regional energy production must be revised.
25. Instead of energy exchanges, fair alternative mechanisms for energy distribution should be developed.
26. CO2 accounting, CO2 taxes and CO2 certificate trading are immediately
as they are counterproductive, encourage speculation and only burden companies and citizens.
27. dieBasis is calling for the abolition of the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) with its CO2 certificate obligation for imports, including for private individuals, because it does not provide any
proven benefits, but only more bureaucracy, especially for SMEs.
? Traffic turnaround - less traffic through more regionality
Regionality is a core element in reducing traffic to a tolerable level. With more regional production of products and more direct marketing, transportation can be reduced. Supply chains are also shortened in the industrial sector when the regional circular economy is expanded. In contrast, we take a critical view of the government-imposed reduction in individual mobility (e.g. in the context of so-called 15-minute cities), as this means personal freedom for many people, which must also be preserved for older and disabled people. The EU law of March 2023 effectively bans the internal combustion engine from 2035, without giving climate-neutral fuels (power to gas; power to liquid) a chance, for example. In view of the devastating eco-balance of electric cars, this must be seen as ideological legislation.
28. dieBasis supports measures to regionalize production and shorten supply chains to reduce traffic.
29. dieBasis rejects restrictions on individual mobility such as the concept of so-called "15-minute cities".
30. the basis is for the preservation of individual transportation.
31. Individual mobility must also become sustainable - but without ideology and open to all technologies.
32. Innovation, technological diversity and technological openness in mobility must be promoted.
33. dieBasis calls for the further development and use of combustion technologies and only sensible, environmentally friendly applications of electromobility.
34. dieBasis is in favor of reversing the EU Parliament's decision to phase out combustion engines for new cars from 2035.
35. A change in environmentally harmful mobility behavior should be brought about by intelligent offers instead of bans.
36. dieBasis calls for the nationwide expansion of local and long-distance public transport to relieve the pressure on private transport.
37. dieBasis calls for repair and expansion of the EU-wide rail network to relieve road transportation.
? Energy efficiency - innovative and voluntary
All buildings in the European Union are to be climate-neutral by 2050. In order to achieve this, the Council of Member States wants only climate-neutral residential buildings to be allowed to be built from 2030. Minimum energy efficiency standards are also to be set for existing houses and apartments. The planned reform of the EU Buildings Directive (EPBD) to include stricter requirements for the energy efficiency of properties is not well thought out from an engineering perspective, is unrealistic and is economically and socially unbalanced. As a result, many owners will be faced with costly renovations in the medium term. A building heating bureaucracy is being created and there is a threat of forced refurbishment or even expropriation for those who cannot afford it.
38. TheBasis welcomes continuous technical improvements and does not stand in the way of energy innovations.
39. Nevertheless, the rapid state-driven dissemination of innovations must be carried out with caution.
40. We want to meet a potentially growing demand for electricity/energy by providing more affordable and environmentally friendly energy.
41. dieBasis rejects the planned reform of the EU Buildings Directive (EPBD): No forced renovation of real estate!
42. The grassroots demand that the switch to supposedly climate-friendly
heat generation technologies (e.g. heat pumps) must be engineering-based, well thought out and affordable for citizens.
43. Energy efficiency measures may only be introduced on a voluntary basis through education and incentives, but not through sanctions.
? Protection of water and marine resources in the EU
Our marine ecosystems, with their biodiversity and their contribution to the global climate, are also of essential importance for life on land. Overfishing, pollutants, waste, especially plastic, lost containers and fishing gear, increasing noise from resource extraction and even deep-sea mining are endangering them. Marine animals are disturbed by underwater communication and sound (e.g. sonar). In addition, 1.6 million tons of old munitions in the North Sea and Baltic Sea and around 5,000 tons of chemical munitions in German waters alone pose an acute environmental threat.
Given the transboundary nature of marine ecosystems and maritime activities, resilient international cooperation is needed to protect them and develop their potential. This requires measures for safe, clean and sustainably managed oceans to be implemented globally. International agreements already exist (e.g. the MARPOL Convention 1973/78, the Flora, Fauna, Habitat Directives, the Marine Conservation Framework Directive of 2008). However, these have so far been insufficiently implemented. The use of sustainable aquaculture systems and sustainable fishing (in accordance with the MSC seal) make an important contribution to the protection of marine animals and algae so that the naturally wild populations can recover.
44. dieBasis calls for the consistent implementation of marine protection agreements.
45. dieBasis supports the initiatives to protect maritime ecosystems through an integrated maritime policy of the European Union.
46. dieBasis calls for the consistent implementation of existing agreements to avoid marine litter (including the avoidance of microplastics) and the development of methods for its removal and disposal.
47. dieBasis calls for better regulation of underwater communication and underwater noise (e.g. seismic surveys, underwater explosions, pile driving, ship noise) in order to protect marine animals, especially marine mammals.
48. dieBasis calls for the systematic and consistent elimination of the dangers posed by old munitions in the oceans.
49. As a trilateral World Heritage Site, the Wadden Sea is of global importance and should continue to be protected as such.
50. dieBasis calls for the consistent application of the guidelines of the MSC seal for sustainable fishing.
51. Deep-sea mining must not take place without an international set of rules to protect ecosystems and prior comprehensive research.
VI. Right to analog life - no digital control
We are on the way to becoming transparent!
For us, human dignity always takes precedence over digital feasibility. We therefore call for a digital ethic that focuses on current and future freedom, human dignity and quality of life.
We are in favor of digital technologies, especially if they are beneficial to European democracy. Technological progress should be guided by the principle of serving society as a whole and must not exclude and discriminate against people who cannot or do not want to use digital technology. In particular, technology must not be used to take advantage of, suppress, censor and control people. Personal data is the property of each individual and is therefore valuable and worth protecting.
The healthy development of the human spirit is important to us, which is why we value and support social interaction. The danger of losing oneself in the digital world was particularly evident during the coronavirus lockdown, which led to isolation, depression and a high suicide rate among the population.
Total transparency of citizens, which could be achieved with a "digital vaccination certificate", for example, contradicts the German constitution and our social values. It also creates an imbalance of power in favor of those who have access to the data. dieBasis rejects this in the interests of limiting power. Informational self-determination must also apply in the age of digitalization. Due to its cross- border nature, the issue of digitalization is a European one.
dieBasis is also committed to Europe:
 The fundamental right to privacy as protection from higher-level structures
 The fundamental right to informational self-determination
 The fundamental right to freedom of movement
 Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation
 Compliance with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights
? the basic requirements for digitization
1. Limit the potential harmful effects of digitalization and introduce ethical rules.
Despite all the positive aspects of digitalization, possible harmful effects must also be taken into account. dieBasis is therefore calling for neutral and independent investigations into 5G technology, for example, as well as research into the development of transmission technology that is guaranteed to be safe for humans.
Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) should serve general prosperity and not lead to the impoverishment of further sections of the population or even be directed against humans. Ethical principles should apply that serve as safety mechanisms to keep increasingly autonomous AI under control. A commission of independent scientists, including a citizens' council, should meet to precisely define ethical rules for AI, robots and drones.
The use of autonomously acting AI, robots and drones for warfare or to kill human life must be excluded and outlawed. We propose extending human rights to this end, similar to the ban on the use of poison gas.
For us, an ethical approach also includes self-determination about the degree of
of our own digitalization: an analogue life without economic and social disadvantages must continue to be possible in principle. The introduction of socially transformative technologies requires grassroots democratic legitimization and control.
2. No digital surveillance
Digital data is valuable and makes many things possible, but we reject unprovoked surveillance, data retention and biometric surveillance. There must be no mass surveillance or creation of movement profiles. Individual surveillance should also only take place under strict state and legal control. The secrecy of correspondence must also apply in the digital sphere.
We reject digital identification or storage anchored in the body, e.g. for access and locking systems, passports or ID cards. Nor should there be any direct or indirect coercion to intervene in the human body in this way.
3. IT sovereignty and net neutrality:
dieBasis calls for sovereignty through self-controlled, secure IT for Europe with its own European data infrastructure to ensure digital self-determination.
? We reject or want to withdraw these EU programs:
4. No digital EU identity - prevent total control.
The EU wants to abolish passports and ID cards. Biometric border controls are to be created with digital identity. Tracking the movements and activities of individuals is a clear violation of the right to privacy and freedom of mobility.
The introduction of a digital identity (ID2020) in conjunction with the EU health passport and the abolition of cash is highly dangerous. The resulting traceability of all transactions will make people transparent to governments, companies and other interest groups.
5. Digital Services Act - censorship becomes mandatory.
With the Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU has created an extremely vague law to replace the German Network Enforcement Act, which leaves individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises at the mercy of almost arbitrary state control and obliges them to take extensive censorship measures. Online providers must examine the societal risks of their services, for example with regard to the spread of harmful content and the impact on elections, human rights or the mental health of users, and take measures to minimize identified risks. We reject censorship by private structures that are not subject to control. Who decides what constitutes a social risk - e.g. the WHO, Facebook, ominous fact- checkers ...? Should politics of opinion be allowed to dictate ethical principles?
Censorship or the prevention of free expression of opinion without legal proceedings, e.g. through upload filters, is also prohibited.
6. No Digital Markets Act in favor of large corporations - strengthen user rights.
With the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the EU has introduced regulation on the "fairness" of markets in the digital sector. So-called "gatekeepers" - the major online platforms - are supposed to treat each other fairly. To ensure this so-called
However, in order to ensure "fairness", users' data protection rights are massively restricted. An exchange of user data between the large multinational online corporations - medium-sized companies and small businesses are of course excluded - is therefore necessary for reasons of "fairness". dieBasis demands the withdrawal of the DMA and a strengthening of user rights vis-à-vis the online platforms.
VII. Finances: Hands off our money - no expropriation and disenfranchisement
The abolition of cash is being driven forward in a targeted manner and in small steps.
The EU Commission has been paving the way for the digital euro as a legal tender since the beginning of 2023. Digital payments can be used to enforce digital identity efficiently. How long will it be before digital money not only supplements cash, but replaces it?
The argument instrumentalized by the "Better Than Cash Alliance" that cash would support tax evasion or money laundering is inappropriate. The attempt to combat crime by abolishing cash should be seen as curing symptoms and not as eliminating the causes of such crime. There is much to suggest that it is about more than fighting crime. In the next phase of the unresolved debt crisis, increased access to private assets could become an issue.
It would have far-reaching consequences if there were no more cash and payments were only possible with electronic currency. Today's banks would be largely superfluous. Income and expenditure would be processed exclusively via an account at the central bank.
The abolition of cash makes us all vulnerable to blackmail
With digital money, all transactions and payment processes become traceable, registered and possibly even compromisable - with the result that we become transparent customers.
This means that nothing stands in the way of complete control and monitoring. The state only needs to deal with the central bank to access the data. With the introduction of a digital central bank currency, the technical prerequisite for totalitarian abuse has been created (e.g. a restriction on payment transactions according to "good" or "bad".
"bad" behavior of citizens, the complete exclusion of financial transactions up to the possibility of completely refusing to shop will be easy to implement with exclusively digital money). We remember that many critical people had their bank accounts terminated as a result of the coronavirus measures.
The dependence of electronic systems on the energy supply is also likely to be a significant risk.
The expropriation and disenfranchisement of people has already begun
The first bonus point systems for citizens are already being piloted, similar to the Chinese "Social Credit System". They are examples of the loss of civil liberties. The Smart City Charter
postulates that "private property is a luxury and there is less need for democratic elections". This is openly promoted in projects such as the "Post-Ownership Society" and the "Post-Voting Society".
The introduction of a digital identity (ID2020) in conjunction with the abolition of cash is highly dangerous. The resulting traceability of all transactions will make people transparent to governments, companies and other interest groups.
Cash secures our freedom and our basic democratic rights.
The demands of dieBasis on the subject of finance are:
1. We demand a legal right to pay in cash!
Cash must also be permanently retained in the EU as a legally recognized means of payment alongside cashless payment transactions. Autonomy over money is a cornerstone of our individual freedom and security. dieBasis consistently advocates the preservation of cash, supports additional regional currencies and advocates the freedom of personal choice for cryptocurrencies. Cash is freedom in action and data protection in action. Abolishing it would be the end of our individual
Freedom rights!
Cash should therefore also be enshrined as a fundamental right in European constitutions. On June 15, 2023, Slovakia became the first country in the world to include the right to pay in cash in its constitution in order to set limits to the digital euro.
2. The creation of money belongs in the hands of a state oriented towards the common good - no special funds and special assets "out of nothing".
We must regain our financial autonomy and end the dominance of financial institutions over the state. At the moment, the banking system creates "money out of nothing" without the money supply being matched by goods and services. This "bank" money ("money out of nothing") is largely created by the banks themselves through lending and has no equivalent value other than "trust" (fiat money). We demand that the creation of money be placed in the hands of a state oriented towards the common good, with the participation of local citizens.
We reject "money without value" for special European funds such as the 770 billion "NextGenerationEU" (Corona aid package/EU reconstruction fund) and the ECB's promotion of government debt, as they lead to even more inflation. It is only a matter of time before this balloon bursts. The loss of purchasing power primarily affects low-income earners and socially disadvantaged fellow citizens.
3. Expropriation and disenfranchisement must be stopped - asset registers, real estate registers and equalization of burdens are the harbingers.
Legally created foundations for an equalization of burdens in Germany and European real estate and asset registers are harbingers of possible expropriations. We therefore reject these laws.
4. The waste of taxpayers' money must be transparently investigated, sanctioned and prevented in future. Politicians must be held liable for this.
5. The EU should not be allowed to levy its own taxes.
The collection of taxes should remain the responsibility of the nation states, which finance the EU through membership fees. The EU is an alliance of sovereign states. Having its own taxes would give it a state-like character. Reducing the tasks of the EU also reduces the costs for the bureaucratic apparatus of the EU Commission.
6. The EU should not be allowed to take out its own loans for investments.
In case of doubt, the large economies in the EU will ultimately have to pay for the loans, as the EU has no revenue of its own and cannot provide any collateral. Investments can be made via the national parliaments and, in the case of regional development programs, from funds that are fed by the member states' contributions.

Animal welfare party = most effective voice
Some people wonder whether a vote for the Animal Welfare Party is effective. If you have ever asked yourself this question, here are a few arguments.
A cross for the party MENSCH UMWELT TIERSCHUTZ - Animal Welfare Party definitely makes sense, because:
There is no percentage hurdle in the European elections and our chances of entering Parliament with two or three female candidates are good.
It shows politicians what is important to you and that they should address your issues.
You will help us to become better known and to campaign more visibly for your goals in the future through more state funding.
You are exercising your most important democratic right and take a stand against "business as usual"!
In times of selfish lobby politics, you are setting an example for empathy and responsibility.

We are committed to a society in which equality and diversity are firmly anchored. Respect and tolerance must be fundamental values, regardless of gender, identity, origin, religion, physical characteristics or economic circumstances. We are fighting for a world without prejudice, in which every person can freely develop their full potential in their career, education and daily interactions. Respect and tolerance for all living beings and future generations should be practiced.
In the Europe we envision, no one will be left on the margins. This requires not only uniform anti-discrimination laws, but also low-threshold, free and public offers for social participation. Everyone has the right to participate in social life and to help shape its conditions. In order to achieve this goal, an appropriate legal framework must be created. We are committed to this!
We are committed to unconditional sea rescue and want to create legal and s a f e ways to escape. Provide less money to the arms industry and place more emphasis on humanity! It is essential to establish a Europe-wide, joint sea rescue service that consistently implements the principle of sea rescue and no longer allows pushbacks. We want to take responsibility and work together to overcome the causes of flight.
Our economic system is designed for permanent growth, but our planet has limited resources. The gap between rich and poor is also widening. We stand for a sustainable, fair economic system that puts an end to the exploitation of people, animals and nature. The strategy of so-called green growth is far from sufficient. What is needed is an economy that sets individual life satisfaction as the benchmark for political decisions instead of constantly creating new consumer needs.
We demand that Europe does not become a global military power, but a global force for peace. The European Union must commit itself to peaceful conflict resolution, must only allow military operations within the framework of UN missions and should play a mediating role worldwide. We refuse to profit from the suffering of other peoples. Therefore, arms exports to areas outside the EU must be banned as a matter of principle and an extremely restrictive European arms export regulation must be implemented.
Note: For reasons of better readability, the simultaneous use of female and male language forms is avoided and the generic feminine is used. Male and other gender identities are explicitly included.
Land use and the agricultural industry are responsible for around 30% of European greenhouse gas emissions: a significant proportion of these emissions come from livestock farming, which releases incredible amounts of climate-damaging methane and CO2 . But that's not all: deforestation, slash-and-burn forest clearance and the draining of moors for pasture and animal feed cultivation as well as the unnecessary transport of animals, feed and fertilizer are pushing the planet to its limits. We can only overcome the climate crisis and create a greener Europe if we initiate a genuine agricultural turnaround and put an immediate end to agro-industrial livestock farming. We can only achieve the climate targets if we finally put an end to the mishandling of animals and initiate a genuine agricultural turnaround immediately!
Overfilled landfills, waste exports, waters and fields full of microplastics, suffering animals: a radical change is needed! 30 million tons of annual plastic waste in Europe is 30 million too much! The European Packaging Regulation must be implemented quickly, but this is only a first step. Far less waste, significantly higher reusable quotas and more recycling are essential.
Of the estimated 10-100 million animal and plant species worldwide, one million are threatened with extinction. This decline in species has dramatic and sometimes unforeseeable consequences for us all - including us humans. In addition to monocultures, hunting and fishing, climate change and environmental pollution, the main cause is the decline in natural habitats. We are therefore calling for land consumption to be monitored and restricted, and for areas to be unsealed and renaturalized. The EU biodiversity strategy, which aims to place 30% of the Union's territory under nature conservation, and even 10% under strict protection, must be implemented consistently. Nature regulates itself and does not need human intervention.
Our industries are dependent on fossil fuels. Coal, gas, oil and even nuclear power mostly come from undemocratic countries and are also destroying the basis of life on our planet. Nuclear power is also extremely expensive overall, while renewable energy sources are the cheapest. They make us independent of imports and are also inexhaustible! We are committed to the expansion of generation, grid and storage capacities and a successful energy transition. Let's make European energy production fit for the future!
The use of pesticides has a significant negative impact on the environment and biodiversity. It is undisputed that many of the 300 or so pesticides used are also toxic to humans. We are vehemently committed to a permanent b a n on synthetic chemical pesticides and are calling for the overdue development of biological alternatives. We are also fighting against the export of pesticides banned in the EU. We must no longer carelessly put everyone's health at risk.
Every day (!), two million so-called "farm" animals are killed in Germany alone. Their short, agonizing lives in confined spaces are characterized by pain, stress, amputation of body parts and slaughter at a young age, often without anaesthesia! This unspeakable suffering must come to an end! We call for an immediate end to the animal industry financed by taxpayers' money!
Animals are directly affected by many European Union decisions. Nevertheless, their interests all too often slip under the radar of decision-makers. For the first time, a Commissioner for Animal Rights is to be a powerful voice for the billions of animals that have so far been without rights. With expertise and empathy, animal rights must finally be incorporated into political decisions!
The transportation of animals by ship and truck under torturous conditions, which are generally tolerated by the responsible veterinary authorities, is a particularly ghastly outgrowth of the meat industry. As an immediate measure, transports to third countries must be banned and the maximum transportation time set at a total of eight hours. Our goal, however, is a strict ban on transportation, including within Europe.
Some people shoot wild animals for pleasure, as a profession or as a sport. This practice is justified by the need to regulate animal populations and protect forests from game browsing. From an ecological point of view, this is not plausible and must therefore no longer be tolerated. Unfortunately, some Member States still have exemptions for the import of hunting trophies from third countries. We are calling for a more consistent EU species protection regulation with import bans and a ban on advertising hunting trips.
Millions of animals are "consumed" every year in the EU for animal testing, even though only modern, animal-free tests can deliver relevant results. We call for an immediate end to the subsidization of all animal testing and the reform of the European chemicals regulation REACH so that only animal-free testing methods are used throughout the EU.
Animals in "fur" farms live in tiny cages, suffer from infected wounds and are brutally killed. Sometimes their fur is pulled off while they are still alive. We want to ban both fur farming and the s a l e o f fur throughout Europe.

I. Preamble
For a family-friendly and strong Europe!
The upcoming elections to the XX European Parliament will determine the direction of the Europe of (the) future.
In the upcoming election, you will decide on the priorities for the next legislative period and beyond.
The European Union needs strong impulses for unity and a stronger unity of the member states.
The identification of European citizens with Europe is crucial for the sustainable continued existence of the European Union.
Originating from the EEC (European Economic Community), the European Union has evolved from an economic alliance into an agricultural alliance. As a result, the member states are now widely branched and many are strongly linked to each other through the euro.
However, the existing tasks within and outside the European Union need to be restructured and supplemented.
We in the German Family Party are calling for a new focus and a reorientation of the European Union.
The European Union must be made more family-friendly. Social policy priorities are now the key to making Europe a strong and reliable continent for European citizens once again.
A European child benefit, which is to exist in addition to national child benefits, is a cornerstone of a new social policy orientation.
A strong society can only be built on strong families.
that can hold its own in global competition. Germany's Family Party is therefore calling for a basic childcare salary, a cost-covering child benefit and the right to vote from birth on behalf of the parents.
At the moment, family policy is not a significant topic in the European Parliament. This absolutely must be changed, and it should be assigned to the working group on labor and social affairs. After all, raising and caring for children by parents is work and should be remunerated accordingly. This step has already been taken in the case of home care. It must be extended to child rearing and care. This would eliminate the injustice that pensions are borne by society as a whole, while the costs of children are mainly borne by the parents. This has led to such a low birth rate that there is a shortage of skilled workers across Europe and the social systems will soon no longer be able to be financed. Whether the gap can be closed by immigration is controversial. The Family Party is in favor of more births in Europe and limited immigration to prevent the formation of parallel societies that bring a completely different culture to Europe.
Europe is a unique global project and is based on shared values and peace. We are also calling for a ceasefire and diplomatic negotiations to solve the problem in Ukraine. We want to significantly strengthen the (job) value of families in the European Union. So strengthen us with your vote on 09.06.2024!
Vote for the Family Party of Germany for a Europe of possibilities and opportunities and so that our future generations can grow up in peace and freedom!
II. Social / family policy
The European Union was once founded to maintain peace and allow the economy to flourish, which has reliably happened within the European Union. Prosperity has grown considerably since the EEC was founded.
To date, however, only the common agricultural policy is the only complete Community funding policy of the European Union, which justifies the relatively high share of the agricultural sector (including support for rural development) in the EU budget.
We in the German Family Party are therefore calling for a reorientation of the European Union in order to significantly increase public acceptance of the European Union. After a common currency and a common agricultural policy, the euro states must take on the overall social task of family and social policy.
The birth of a child is associated with a serious economic disadvantage for all parents. Children are still the greatest risk of poverty in the 21st century. In Germany alone, every 5th child lives in poverty with their parents.
As a result, the birth rate in Germany in 2022 was just 1.46 children per woman, putting Germany at the bottom end of the European league.
It is obvious that the framework conditions for (starting) a family must be improved, if only to prevent families with children from having to live and grow up in poverty. The Family Party sees this as its most urgent task, both in Germany and throughout Europe, and is therefore calling for the creation of a family fund into which everyone pays 4% of their gross income in order to provide a child benefit that covers the costs, a child-raising salary and an appropriate pension for parents regardless of their income.
federal, state and municipal budgets.
By implementing the proposed measures, Germany's Family Party hopes that more children will be born again; that the social systems will remain affordable and sustainable; that parents will have more time for their children; that no child will have to grow up in poverty; that abortions will no longer be carried out for social reasons; that maintenance payments will be abolished; that families, especially single parents, will no longer be exposed to the risk of poverty; women can decide to have a child at a younger age because they are financially secure; school, training, studies or employment can be continued even after parental leave; child-rearing and employment can be better reconciled and the economic disadvantage of parents during child-rearing and in retirement age is eliminated.
A social policy orientation for the benefit of European citizens is long overdue!
1. European child benefit
The creation of a European child benefit alongside national child benefits should directly support and promote families throughout Europe. A uniform European amount of 50 per child would reduce the social gap within the European Union and primarily help families.
The cost of living for families has risen enormously in recent years due to pandemic-related damage, disrupted supply chains and escalating energy costs within the European Union.
A European child benefit (to be applied for) would show people within the European Union that Europe is more than just a loose association of states held together by (agricultural) economic interests.
The introduction would also curb intra-European social flight.
The total costs, including the necessary administrative costs, would amount to around 50 billion. This is not to be financed through a reallocation in the EU budget, but through the introduction of a financial transaction tax and the creation of a family fund.
The top priority for the German Family Party is to realize a child benefit that covers the costs! This provides for families to receive 319 for a child (in Germany) up to the age of 6, 414 up to the age of 14 and 475 up to the age of 18 (European + national child benefit).
The national child benefit currently paid is far too low. In 2023 it amounted to 250
. Parents currently have to pay the difference from their taxed income. A necessary adjustment must be made accordingly.
In the last legislative period, we made a significant push during the German and Portuguese presidencies and reached a consensus that splitting the amount of 50 would be acceptable to a majority. 25 should be paid directly to the families and 25
 will be transferred to the community to support local families. We aim to ensure that every child in the European Union is guaranteed a hot lunch!
2. Educational salary
The Family Party of Germany advocates a (social insurance-based) child- raising salary that is paid to all parents. Parental work at home must be treated equally to professional work! This will give them real freedom of choice as to whether they look after their child themselves, especially in the first three years, or place it in external childcare, which they pay for out of the childcare salary. Toddlers need to be attached to a person so that they are strengthened internally. From the age of 3, we recommend
Attendance at a free kindergarten.
The amount of the childcare salary at a minimum wage of 12.41 is to be set at 2,174 gross (1,550 net) for a child up to the age of 3, 1,118 gross (951 net) up to the age of 6 and 559 gross (547 net) up to the age of 12.
An upper limit is set for several children. Local family advisors should contact the families regularly to ensure that the children are properly cared for.
3. European pension
The European Union, through the Commission and the Parliament, should create the framework for the ECB to manage a pension fund that invests in (European) bonds and commercial enterprises in order to create a funded financing pillar for pensions for life. Every EU citizen should thus be given the opportunity to make secure provision for old age on the capital market.
Appropriate support for pension provision should be considered, especially the inclusion of children, in order to do immediate justice to parents' child-rearing efforts. In addition to the child-raising salary for the work required to raise a child, the equalization of family burdens includes a child benefit that covers the minimum costs incurred by a child and also a pension, the calculation of which must take into account the actual child-raising periods. For both parents!
The childcare salary already entitles the parents to a pension. As parents, the current pensioners have raised their children at a considerable financial cost. For this, 3 years are currently deducted from their pension. According to the Herzog Commission, it should be 6 years
be. The Family Party of Germany advocates a corresponding increase at national level, which must amount to more than 100 per child per month!
The European pension fund is intended to place the pension provision of EU citizens on a further, secure pillar, as many national pension models of the member states are currently under existential threat due to demographic change!
4. Right to vote from birth
Parents with children make up around 50 percent of the population, but only 30 percent of those eligible to vote. All are subject to taxes and duties. For example, parents always pay the full excise duty for their children, but the children have no say whatsoever in the democratic election - which also decides their future.
We therefore welcome a gradual lowering of the voting age for all elections in our democracy. In the upcoming European elections, 16-year-olds will be eligible to vote for the first time. We believe that every EU citizen in a democracy should have the right to participate in an election at the latest from the point at which they register to vote on their own. This can also be the case before the age of 16.
Rigid exclusion from an election is not necessary in a modern democracy in the 21st century.
5. Facilitating the acceptance of an apprenticeship
Within the European Union, an opportunity must be created to make it easier for young Europeans and adolescents to accept training in another member state and, if necessary, to promote this. The background to this is the high level of youth unemployment in many European (mostly southern) countries. If Europe has a future
wants to invest in young people today. The young people of today are the voters and citizens of the coming decades. An appropriate network must be established to avoid losing this generation.
6. Free one-year rail ticket
The idea of an Interrail ticket has already been discussed within the European Union and implemented with a small contingent. We believe that we should make it possible for all taxpaying citizens to travel through Europe for a year once in their lifetime.
We reject rigid age limits here for reasons of age discrimination.
7. Strengthening children's rights
Children do not have a vote, but they are the future of our society. Every investment in our children is paid back to society as a sustainability dividend. Tomorrow's taxpayers will finance and consolidate the social security systems of the future, provided they are properly supported.
Therefore, as a first step, we are fighting for a free meal for every child in Europe and a cost-neutral school education that includes school materials and transportation.
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child must be a firm guideline for European policy. Parental rights must be safeguarded and the basic principle of state guardianship must be upheld.
8. European housing offensive
Housing shortages are a central issue for many people in their everyday lives and are the result of inadequate policies in the respective member states. Whether artificial shortages due to vacation offers and the elimination of housing on the market, or simply poor planning, excessive
building standards, as well as inaction on obvious speculative transactions. The Union will have to act to compensate for the political deficit of many national governments in order to create and maintain an important livelihood for people. In particular, state housing construction is needed!
III. Economy and finance
The economic interdependence and financial solidarity of the European member states are at the heart of the European Union.
If the continent of Europe is doing well economically and financially, the prospects for the Federal Republic of Germany as a member state are also positive. Intra-European trade has become a very important pillar for Germany as an export nation. Without European domestic demand, which is also due to the common currency, the euro, the development of economic growth in the Federal Republic of Germany would be different.
Nonetheless, after the financial and economic crisis, measures to prevent the opposite trend must be implemented, especially in good economic years.
In the election manifesto for the 2019 European elections, we had already called for the following: "For some time now, the ECB has primarily been supporting the southern European member states with its low interest rate policy, while at the same time driving stock markets and property prices to unimagined heights. The drop height for the next economic crisis is increasingly reaching dangerous highs."
In the meantime, the economic crisis is over. Normal citizens no longer have any real chance of realizing their dream of owning their own four walls due to the forced increase in interest rates caused by inflation. Immigration is increasing the pressure on available living space. The transformation process of the economy will produce many winners, but also losers.
1. Financial transaction tax
Since 2011, attempts have been made to implement a financial transaction tax in the European Union. The last attempt by France and Germany in 2019 was inadequate in its design. Only taxing shares is absurd.
It's all about derivatives, bond and high-frequency trading! A recent study by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy comes to the conclusion that the introduction of such a tax can be supported from an economic point of view.
We are therefore advocating the introduction of a full transaction tax in order to ensure that the financial industry contributes appropriately to the tasks facing society as a whole.
The financial transaction tax must be introduced within the European Union. It should only amount to 0.2% for every purchase and sale of a financial product on all intra-European stock exchanges (including direct trading within banks - linked to the banking license!). Half of the revenue is to go to the member states and half to a European social fund, from which, among other things, the European child benefit is to be paid.
The level of 0.2% is so low that there is no reason to fear any significant impact on the returns of normal investors. The only significant impact will be in high-frequency trading and possibly in the emerging market of robo-advisors, which can also be seen as partly responsible for the dramatic developments of the financial crisis.
There is also no reason to fear a widespread migration to circumvent the financial transaction tax, as a European banking license is required to trade in financial products. Great Britain has
have already experienced what this means. Following the hard Brexit, the financial industry has largely moved out of London.
2. Capital gains tax of 25 - 35% applicable throughout Europe
An EU directive should introduce a uniform capital gains tax throughout the European Union in order to prevent tax evasion. This should not exceed 35%, but should not fall below 25% either. The revenues remain with the member states to be levied.
At the same time, the tax-free allowances for interest income must be increased in order to make it easier for the middle class to accumulate assets. The current tax-free allowance in Germany should be increased from 1000 to
2500 (5000 for married couples). Furthermore, an additional tax-free allowance of 1000 per child should be granted, with the maximum tax-free allowance being set at 10,000 in total.
3. Introduction of European minimum tax rates
The Family Party of Germany advocates the introduction of European minimum tax rates in order to curb the galloping global tax competition, at least within the EU (and its overseas territories!), but still allow a healthy level of tax competition. Due to their (infrastructure) structure, small countries in particular have the opportunity to demand very low tax rates, partly due to low government costs. Larger countries, on the other hand, do not have this option. In order to protect them, a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% must be introduced for companies within the European Union. In addition, free tax competition can take place below the member states.
Secret agreements between companies and EU member states (Ireland/Apple; Amazon/Luxembourg) are to be declared illegal and give European tax courts the opportunity to additionally penalize the allegedly saved amount with three times the value.
In addition, for internationally operating groups, the taxable amount must be set in relation to the turnover in the respective member state. Accordingly, if a company generates 70% of its turnover in France and 30% in Germany, the corresponding taxes must be paid in the respective member state.
Large companies cannot use the existing infrastructure (level of education, transport, etc.) on the one hand, but avoid the necessary financing requirements through tax avoidance by transferring their profits to tax havens.
A (minimum) total tax burden in the company (trade tax
+ corporation tax) of 15% (currently around 30% for corporations in Germany) is considered necessary by the Family Party of Germany in order to prevent intra-European tax avoidance.
Companies in need of government support are not allowed to pay bonuses to management or dividends for 2 years.
4. Withdrawal of the banking license
Any bank found to have assisted investors in tax evasion will face a fine of three times the amount it has misappropriated on behalf of taxpayers. In a next step (in case of repetition), the European banking license will be withdrawn as a last resort and trading in European financial products will be prohibited.
5. Euro bonds / Manacle bonds
We are opposed to the introduction of Eurobonds, which only serve the purpose of enabling states in financial difficulties to obtain favorable conditions for state financing, since in addition to the state to be held liable (presumably this will be done by a European institution), all states involved will be jointly liable through the Eurobonds.
liable.
The Federal Republic of Germany would thus be a debtor for the debts of other states without having any influence on the use of the money!
This would be unacceptable and would mean that the pressure to reform, which arises from high interest rates on government bonds, would be circumvented and the structural problems to be overcome would not be resolved but postponed from election to election as usual.
In our opinion, euro bonds would make sense if they were managed by a European finance minister and the funds were used specifically to build up the European economy, which would benefit all member states.
Large infrastructure projects such as power lines and transportation routes would be very suitable application examples.
We have brought manacle bonds into play as an alternative. Joint bonds may only be issued if they are a joint European issue. In this way, we could give an enormous boost to the energy transition and create a European high-speed network to reduce internal flights as far as possible. European investment in a common European future.
6. Free trade agreement
The Family Party of Germany recognizes the necessity of free trade agreements. Legal transactions require common regulations and agreements. Uniform standards simplify legal transactions immensely and have positive economic effects, such as the elimination of customs regulations.
When concluding free trade agreements, the EU must act on an equal footing. Free trade agreements that benefit the EU to a particularly one-sided extent, such as the free trade agreement with Mauritania, must be concluded on an equal footing.
be renegotiated on a fair basis.
The exploitation of economically weak market participants must be stopped in the interests of the EU. A lack of prospects is what drives people to flee.
Furthermore, free trade agreements must not only be fair, but also transparent and give the people of Europe the greatest possible say.
7. Cash
The Family Party of Germany is openly committed to the preservation of cash. Overly restricting or even abolishing cash is not expedient.
Although the cost of cash in Germany alone is in the tens of billions, freedom of choice is the essence of any democracy and advanced society.
Germany's Family Party is open to a maximum limit on cash transactions that does not affect the average consumer in order to make illegal transactions more difficult.
8. Digital Euro
We are open to new technologies. The current endeavor to introduce an account with the ECB for every citizen up to a maximum of x000  is an important and correct step in order to have a basis in the digital age. We need European solutions to make us less dependent on foreign banking systems.
We believe that one of the main advantages of implementing the digital euro is that it will finally be possible to make direct payments to citizens in an unbureaucratic manner. Especially in times of crisis, we need powerful instruments that are highly efficient when needed.
Reminder. The German Finance Minister Lindner manages after more than
year to link an IBAN with the social security number in order to help people and families financially as quickly as possible in unforeseeable times of crisis.
A digital euro could also be used to implement manacle bonds to promote investment in the member states.
IV. Agriculture
Agriculture is currently the only central issue that the European Union is pursuing with its own economic policy. This is also reflected in the EU agricultural budget, which is the only one in the EU budget.
1. Export of agricultural products
The European Union must live up to its global responsibility.
The export of subsidized agricultural products, which threaten the existence of domestic markets such as in Africa, should be more strictly regulated. The destruction of foreign agricultural markets in economically weak regions cannot be in the interests of the European member states, given the influx of people who (have to) leave their homeland due to a lack of prospects.
All economic development had its origins in agriculture. Only then did industry emerge and finally the service sector.
The threat posed by European agricultural products to many foreign farms, particularly in developing countries, is becoming increasingly dramatic. In its own interest, the European Union must rethink its agricultural export policy.
2. No discrimination against part-time farmers
The European Union is currently pursuing a policy of "get big or get out" and subsidizing large agricultural businesses first and foremost.
In order to prevent American conditions in the agricultural sector and
In order to preserve the diversity of European agriculture, the European Union must abandon its one-sided support policy and also take part-time farmers into account when providing support.
3. Fundamental right to water
Water is an essential resource for humanity. Intensive agriculture is increasingly threatening the world's water supplies.
Groundwater is also increasingly polluted by agriculture, such as through the use of pesticides and tons of liquid manure. Nitrate levels are constantly reaching new highs.
A strengthened environmental protection authority must enforce the fundamental right to clean water that is to be created and safeguard it through controls with the support of national authorities.
In addition, the European Union must prohibit water as a liberal competitive product in order to ensure a steady supply of water for all EU citizens.
Privatization of water of any kind must be strictly controlled. Water cooperatives represent an economically sensible approach. Corporations, on the other hand, which are obliged to act exclusively for profit for shareholders, should be excluded from the water business.
4. Use of pesticides such as glyphosate
The use of pesticides such as glyphosate must be applied very restrictively and strong pesticides that demonstrably disturb the environment to such an extent that lasting damage to the environment is to be feared must be banned immediately.
Glyphosate destroys the insect world to such an extent that the food chain is fundamentally threatened in its existence and considerable damage is caused.
effects on other animal species.
The European Union must promote less intensive agriculture and more sustainable agriculture. A corresponding redistribution should be sought.
We must not lose sight of the individual farmer. Affordable and safe food production is essential for every civil society. Accordingly, we must act with prudence and foresight and maintain adaptable transitional regulations. Working together to improve the world instead of imposing one-sided enforcement.
5. Animal welfare
The European Union must make a clear commitment to animal welfare.
Animal experiments are to be banned in principle and can only be approved for a limited period if there is a proven compelling need.
Intensive farming and the serious monocultization of agriculture, for example through intensive livestock farming and the operation of biogas plants, must not be further exacerbated by subsidy programmes and (mis)use of natural resources.
) incentives are strengthened.
Factory farming must be fundamentally curbed. In the interests of animal welfare, uniform, improved conditions are needed across Europe, also to prevent competitive advantages for individual member states with less animal welfare.
In addition, a clear labeling requirement for meat products must be implemented within the European Union in order to provide all consumers with sufficient information so that they can orient their consumption behavior towards animal welfare.
V. Energy, environment and climate
The European Union must assume much more joint responsibility when it comes to combating climate change and protecting the environment. The Family Party of Germany considers a common energy policy to be essential, as this is the key to major structural problems. Both the nuclear phase-out and the coal phase-out are absolutely necessary in order to leave future generations an environment worth living in and to curb global climate damage.
1. Energy transition
The energy transition must be thought of in European terms. The wind-rich north must cooperate more closely with the sun-rich south with existing hydropower plants in the Alps and Scandinavian countries in order to expand the use of renewable energies across Europe.
Development of a European electricity grid to enable a Europe-wide energy transition (expansion and promotion of solar and photovoltaic energy in the southern states of Europe, use of hydropower from the Scandinavian countries).
The use of manacle bonds for financing is a suitable instrument for the expansion of a European energy transition. A green Europe that can significantly reduce emissions and immissions benefits all Europeans equally and does not create false incentives.
Energy and solar parks are also a job engine in the relevant member states and create predominantly well-paid jobs that are subject to social insurance contributions.
2. Development of a European electricity grid
A European electricity grid should merely connect the cardinal points with each other via electricity highways in order to achieve a European energy transition.
efficiently from the outset. Existing grids are to be expanded in consultation with the respective member states where suitable. This should enable synergies between wind and solar energy to be exploited. In addition, hydropower and pumped storage plants (Alps and Scandinavia) should be integrated.
Mistakes such as those made in the German energy transition must not be repeated. The fact that billions of euros are spent each year in Germany to compensate operators of wind farms and solar plants due to feed-in stoppages caused by external disconnection due to voltage peaks is a phenomenon of poor coordination and implementation.
3. Standard market energy prices and no European EEG
Closer cooperation and efficiency, as well as the possibility of financing, create a one-sided burden on the consumer. Instead of promoting conventional power plants, any subsidies must be redirected in favor of future energies.
If a uniform European implementation should fail (due to the adherence to national interests), an implementation with interested member states should be sought, even if this should result in a long-term disadvantage for national electricity markets that have withdrawn from the common electricity market.
The former idea of a community for coal and steel must be transformed into a community for clean energy.
4. Strengthening the European Environment Agency (EEA)
The European Environment Agency (EEA) needs to be restructured. Its current remit is merely to present relevant information and data in the field of the environment.
The EEA must be given powers along the lines of the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This requires European environmental protection laws to be enacted, which are monitored and, if necessary, penalized by the EEA.
The need for a strong European environmental authority has been revealed by the scandalous events surrounding the diesel scandal. National authorities have succumbed to lobbying and are massively limited in their ability to act.
Without the EPA, the diesel scandal would probably never have been uncovered.
We believe that future generations in particular have a right to an intact environment.
5. Co2 certificates
Emissions trading is an instrument of European environmental policy to reduce pollutant emissions at the lowest possible economic cost. In order for climate change mitigation to succeed at all, emissions trading must be fundamentally reformed so that it can achieve its intended effect efficiently in the near future. The proportion of tradable certificates must be reduced by more than 4% annually so that emissions trading becomes an effective cornerstone of European environmental policy.
VI. Infrastructure
Europe needs a strong infrastructure, which forms the basis of social and economic life. The long overdue expansion at all levels must also be understood and used as a job engine for Europe.
1. Increased promotion of large-scale projects
European joint projects must be considered, which can create a connecting element to the population.
A European energy transition can become the European Union's first major central project to create the first "green" continent.
Irrespective of its potential political and economic impact, a European energy transition would send a clear signal against climate change and global environmental destruction.
2. Intra-European mobility
Intra-European transport routes need to be closer and better interconnected. There is a lot of untapped potential in the area of rail transport.
Especially in view of the increase in travelers and passengers, a European high-speed train connecting major European cities as quickly as possible is essential to become competitive with air travel.
The increase in air traffic is a serious threat to our global climate.
Green electricity makes it possible to convert rail transportation in an easy and less complicated way by using electric overhead lines.
The sluggish development of electromobility in the automotive industry shows how difficult it is to switch from conventional drives to more "sustainable" drives. Irrespective of the theoretical feasibility of electromobility in the automotive industry, it is highly unlikely that sufficient raw materials (rare earths, cobalt, graphite, etc.) will be available to convert all commercial aircraft once the revolution is complete in the next decade. Battery production based on current scientific knowledge is not possible indefinitely.
Europe's cities are increasingly suffocating from traffic congestion.
Germany's Family Party is therefore calling for a comprehensive, pan- European concept to relieve congestion in our city centers.
VII. Defense / Interior
The world has changed dramatically in the 21st century. Defense armies are working more and more closely together in a network in order to accomplish common tasks. In addition, police authorities must also work more closely together. European networking with corresponding data exchange is essential for the security of citizens.
1. Expansion of information rights of intra-European authorities
The authorities of the member states must work together more closely, especially in the fight against terrorism and crime, and have access to joint databases. A European counter-terrorism group distributed across individual member states is essential.
2. Dealing with refugees
It is a shame that refugees still have to be discussed in this election because no sustainable solutions have yet been found.
The Family Party of Germany advocates compliance with Dublin III, but calls for a binding European distribution quota to relieve the burden on border states.
In order to ensure uniform procedures, European legal frameworks must be created to decide uniformly who is to be declared in need of protection and under what conditions someone can live within the European Union (immigration law).
In addition, assistance should be defined to support national states with accommodation and integration.
The Family Party of Germany is also in favor of actively combating the causes of flight. As stated on agricultural and economic issues
If we want to build up the economies of other countries, we must actively build them up and not hinder or even destroy them with cheap exports.
A lack of prospects is the driving force behind many refugees and must be eliminated by creating economically sustainable structures.
Refugees from crisis regions need our European protection, and Europe must be a good host and help and support people as best it can. They should learn as much as they can from our culture and take it with them. Take them with them, as it must be made clear from the outset that they are guests and that they must return to their country as soon as it is humanly possible to do so in order to rebuild it.
Otherwise, many areas around the world will be destabilized and remain perpetual trouble spots. Europe and its refugee policy must be aligned with our fundamental Christian values of charity and tolerance.
There is no place in Europe for dull right-wing slogans and racism.
However, the European Parliament also has a duty to work towards a uniform global refugee policy under the auspices of the UN.
3. Standardized military objects
Military objects such as combat aircraft and tanks must be standardized and produced by European arms companies. They should be used exclusively for the defense of Europe.
This should not only significantly reduce costs, but also make it possible to enforce a restrictive stance on arms exports.
Arms exports to crisis regions must be banned as a matter of principle. The European Parliament must have the power of control and be authorized to issue instructions.
4. Establishment of a European army
A European army is essential in the 21st century in order to be able to carry out corresponding tasks cost-effectively. The provision of larger
The establishment of national armies is not only cost-intensive, but also not uncomplicated when it comes to implementing any joint missions, for example within NATO.
A European army would provide a partner that is well equipped to take on larger military tasks on its own.
Furthermore, a European army would more than illustrate the European guiding principle of peace.
However, the right to maintain national armies should not be affected. The tasks of national armies are currently too different in the European member states to simply replace them with a European army. Moreover, the feeling of national incapacitation should not arise. A European army should use and release synergies, especially in economic terms.
VIII. Strengthen parliamentary rights
The rights of the European Parliament, which is the only institution that can be elected by European citizens, must be considerably strengthened. It is unreasonable for a parliament to be allowed to call itself a "parliament", even though the most important decisions are implemented by the European Commission.
A model such as that practiced in Germany with the Bundestag and Bundesrat is at least desirable. A differentiation between consent and objection laws should do sufficient justice to all interests.
But a main right of proposal as a decisive element is simply unworthy of a parliament.
Vote for the Family Party of Germany for a Europe of possibilities and opportunities and so that our future generations can grow up in peace and freedom
DECISION
of the European Party Conference of the FDP, Berlin, January 28, 2024
The FDP's program for the 2024 European elections
Europe. Simple. Make it.
Let's unleash Europe's energy for more freedom and more prosperity.
The corona pandemic, the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine and the brutal terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel in October 2023 are turning points for the whole of Europe. The European Union is facing a crucial test. The numerous crises have revealed that the completion of the European peace and prosperity project is far from over. On the contrary: war is once again raging on our continent. The European Union is not speaking with one voice when it comes to key foreign and security policy challenges such as supporting Ukraine and Israel. Democracy and the rule of law are under increasing pressure across Europe. Radical parties are widely represented in national parliaments and are gaining ground in some cases. Social cohesion is under threat from Islamism, anti-Semitism, right- wing and left-wing extremism and an increasingly polarized climate of opinion. Citizens in the EU are burdened by temporarily high inflation, while public budgets are affected by higher interest rates and growing expenditure. SMEs and industry are struggling with disrupted supply chains, rising commodity prices and a persistent shortage of skilled workers, partly due to demographic factors. The energy supply in the European Union resembles a patchwork quilt and is therefore neither crisis- proof nor efficient. Europe is lagging behind the international competition when it comes to cutting- edge technologies that are required for rapid crisis management and a sovereign and sustainable EU. In addition to these national and European challenges, there are also global challenges: combating irregular migration and smuggling gangs, the fight against global warming, systemic competition with autocracies and dictatorships and the defense against cyber attacks.
All of these challenges cannot be overcome at a national level alone. We are convinced that Europe has the energy to overcome the crises and challenges of our time and to develop new opportunities from them. Europe has the energy to accelerate the development of the great potential of its citizens. Europe has the energy to become a global center for groundbreaking innovations and cutting-edge technologies. And Europe has the energy to become a strong and effective player in international relations, standing up with one voice for democracy and human rights worldwide - and fighting for them when necessary.
In recent years, however, the EU has not been able to release this energy. Instead, it has shackled itself: with unchecked growth in bureaucracy and the regulation of even the smallest details and private areas of life. With overly complex and non-transparent decision-making processes that people cannot understand. With subsidization mechanisms that distribute too much money ineffectively. With too much pleasure in prohibitions and too little trust in personal responsibility and inventiveness.
Our mission is to change this. We want to unleash Europe's energy for more freedom and more prosperity. To achieve this, we want to take three fundamental steps.
Firstly: Europe must become simpler. For us, this also includes strengthening the principle of subsidiarity. People should not associate the EU with over-regulation or bans, but with simple, fast and comprehensible solutions to the problems of our time. Transparent and swift decisions, digital participation opportunities and service offerings as well as a bold reduction in regulation and bureaucracy create trust, make people want to participate and make it clear that the European Union is there for its citizens - and not the other way around. If we make it easier to invent, research, create and use educational opportunities across Europe without borders, Europe can regain its leading role in global technological progress by the end of this decade.
Secondly, Europe must become stronger. Citizens must be convinced: Europe's borders are secure, irregular migration is strictly prevented, people who are required to leave the country are quickly returned, the rule of law is consistently enforced throughout Europe and a powerful European army is ready for action in the event of a military emergency to protect people, democracy and Europe's interests.
Thirdly, Europe must become more of a market economy. In systemic competition with other regions of the world, our economic strength is the decisive factor. By sharpening the principles of the social market economy, through more free trade with the free world, by dismantling subsidy and distribution mechanisms and by completing the digital and energy single market, we are creating a strong and crisis-proof economic area as well as opportunities for growth and prosperity for all Europeans.
For us Free Democrats, there is no question that the European Union is a unique success story. It has brought peace, freedom, security, progress and prosperity to the people in the member states! This success story must be secured and continued through courageous reforms. For us as a European party, the EU is much more than an economic community, it is a community of values that has its roots in Europe's rich cultural and social diversity and in which our future lies. Even if not everyone likes it and one-sided criticism of Brussels is easier than showing backbone for the European idea: We are committed to Europe and are fighting for a strong Europe not just out of reason, but out of passionate conviction! We have clear ideas and arguments for a Europe that fully unleashes its own forces and the energy of its citizens - on the basis of a modern European constitution. This is what we are fighting for in Europe. That is why we are standing for election. That is why we are seeking the support of voters. For more freedom and more prosperity. Let's just do it!
A Europe that opens up educational and career opportunities - Simply. Make.
We Free Democrats want to make it easier to take advantage of education and employment opportunities throughout the EU. After all, the best educational and career opportunities are the basis for a self-determined life and individual advancement. This is what we are fighting for in Europe:
The member states of the European Union are home to excellent universities with diverse research focuses and internationally recognized expertise. In order to continue to guarantee this excellence, we are calling for further strengthening in the area of education and research, as excellent education and free research are indispensable prerequisites for innovation and prosperity and thus for a better future for Europe. Internships in European companies promise valuable experience and impetus for future careers. We want to unleash the potential that lies in Europe's wealth of knowledge. Be it a student exchange in France, an internship in Sweden or a study abroad program in Poland: We want to break down existing barriers so that the European education area becomes an area of personal opportunity for everyone in the EU. We want to establish the free movement of education as a new fundamental freedom of the European Union.
We want to coordinate the European vocational training and school systems more closely where it serves educational mobility. We therefore want to extend the Copenhagen Process on the quality and recognition of vocational education and training to school education and make it a success like the Bologna Process. We want to harmonize semester and examination periods in the EU. This will simplify the planning of stays abroad and prevent, for example, students from having to extend their studies due to differing periods. We want to make it easier to find the most suitable university across Europe. We also want to simplify application processes. To this end, a central online application portal for the EU should be introduced. We are calling for the introduction of a digital European Student Card so that students can easily identify themselves across Europe.
Erasmus+ is a success story. It has enabled millions of young people to gain experience abroad in Europe. We want to build on this by strengthening Erasmus+ and improving access for teachers, pupils and trainees. Our aim is for all pupils to be able to spend six months of their schooling abroad in Europe, regardless of their parents' income. Other EU partner countries should be offered the status of program country, especially the candidate countries. We particularly want to support multinational universities in border regions and degree courses as well as pre-doctoral and post- doctoral programs that require a stay at at least two European universities or research institutes. This applies in particular to degree courses with a double degree at several universities. In vocational education and training, we particularly want to promote showing young people European prospects in the skilled trades and dual training occupations. To promote social commitment and cultural exchange in Europe, we also want to facilitate cross-border activities by non-profit organizations and strengthen the European Voluntary Service as well as cultural and sports exchanges between member states.
We also want to use the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence (AI) in education. AI applications can support the individual learning of pupils with tailored learning materials. AI also offers the opportunity to relieve the burden on teachers. Pupils should be taught how to use artificial intelligence as early as possible in order to prepare them for a working world that is increasingly influenced by AI. We reject over-regulation of AI that is hostile to innovation.
We also want to remove barriers to labor mobility in the EU and simplify complicated and lengthy processes. All doors must be open to motivated and hard-working people who want to get ahead and use their skills for progress and growth in Europe. In particular, we want to simplify and speed up months of bureaucratic procedures for the recognition of foreign professional qualifications. To this end, we are calling for digital one-stop stores as central points of contact in every EU member state. These should, for example, enable the rapid translation of European qualifications into their national equivalents. We call for the EU Posting of Workers Directive to be modernized and simplified. We want to limit the considerable bureaucratic obligations, i.e. fulfilling the obligation to register with the respective country and providing proof of social security affiliation (A1 certificate), to situations worthy of protection and we particularly want to exempt all short professional trips and postings from the directive. We want to enable self-determined working models, in particular remote work in other EU countries, with legal certainty. Entitlements from national compulsory pension systems can be combined in the EU. We want to create more transparency through an EU-wide platform that calculates the various pension entitlements. In this way, we strengthen the flexibility and mobility of employees and the self-employed. We want to create fair working conditions for platform workers, instead of stifling the self-employed, and are committed to a comprehensive revision of the EU Platform Workers Directive. We want to make the EU Working Time Directive more flexible.
We Free Democrats are convinced that labor market and social policy are rightly the responsibility of the member states. The EU only has a political role to play in issues that actually have a significant cross-border impact on the internal market or freedom of movement. Immigration to another member state in order to receive higher social benefits, on the other hand, is not a matter of free movement within the EU. This must also be enforced in practice. The EU Commission must introduce a reform of the child benefit regulations that makes it possible to adjust the amount of child benefit to the cost of living in the child's country of residence.
In view of the worsening shortage of skilled workers, the EU is dependent on the immigration of qualified workers. We Free Democrats are therefore calling for an EU strategy for the recruitment of skilled workers. The goal must be a largely harmonized immigration law for skilled workers that also allows third-country nationals uncomplicated mobility for the purpose of gainful employment. We want to establish a modern two-pillar system: We want to further open up the Blue Card to non- academic skilled workers and we want to lower minimum salary thresholds. We also want to introduce a European talent pool with a points system based on the Canadian model. We want immigration into the labor market and not into the social security systems. We want to extend the Dutch model of a one-year orientation visa for graduates from the world's top 200 universities to the entire EU. This will enable the controlled immigration of qualified specialists and increase the EU's attractiveness in international competition. For well-integrated asylum seekers, there must be the option of "changing tracks" to one of the two pillars
immigration into the labor market. We also want to promote the willingness of many older people to voluntarily contribute their experience and expertise after retirement.
Language barriers in administrative procedures in the EU must be removed. To this end, we want to introduce English as a second administrative language in the European Union. This should enable all EU citizens to communicate better with public authorities in other EU countries. This will facilitate administrative procedures in connection with work, training and studies. In particular, we also want to use AI applications to translate forms and administrative documents.
A Europe that generates growth and cutting-edge innovation - Simply. Make.
We Free Democrats stand for a strong social market economy, openness to technology and free trade. We clearly reject a planned economy, protectionism and subsidy races. That is why we are combative in Europe:
Both the dual transformation on the path to digitalization and climate neutrality as well as international dependencies pose major challenges for the European economy. However, the current EU Commission is tackling this with the wrong instruments, especially when it comes to implementing the Green Deal: it is not the EU's job to restrict companies through detailed control, guarantee sales, allocate resources and artificially set prices. On the contrary: we need more competition, more free trade and better conditions for private investment and start-ups.
Above all, the ever-increasing bureaucratic burden is nipping new economic growth in the bud. Under EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (CDU), additional bureaucracy has been created on an ongoing basis. EU laws now account for 57 percent of the bureaucratic burden in Germany. Companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the self-employed, are forced to spend valuable energy and time dealing with immense bureaucratic requirements in the face of this regulatory frenzy. We can no longer afford this. Otherwise, economic dynamism and progress will take place outside the EU and jobs and prosperity will be at stake. We Free Democrats therefore want to initiate a trend reversal for a radical reduction in bureaucracy. Only in this way can the EU be internationally competitive as a business location and become an engine for new growth and prosperity. Reducing bureaucracy also strengthens citizens' trust in an efficient EU that solves problems.
To this end, we are calling for a "Bureaucracy Reduction Act". We want to free the economy from at least 50 percent of bureaucratic burdens. For every new burden imposed by EU regulation, existing burdens must be consistently abolished twice in accordance with the "one in, two out" rule. Bureaucracy at EU level is still a black box. There is a lack of control over bureaucratic costs, which often continue to increase in the course of complex legislative procedures.
increase. We call for the compliance costs ultimately incurred by those affected to be assessed in euros and made transparent. It is also important that an empirical inventory is carried out. We therefore call for the systematic recording of bureaucracy costs resulting from EU legislation. The German bureaucracy cost index could serve as a model. In addition, EU directives must be transposed into national law without additional bureaucracy. We reject the overfulfilment of EU requirements, so-called "gold plating". We also call for laws and regulations, where possible, to be passed with a specific expiration date, a so-called "sunset clause". In addition, the current state aid law must be revised. We want to continue to see strong protection of competition in Europe, but the increasing overburdening of state aid with other issues, for example, must be reversed. We need more technological openness and less bureaucracy - including in the Climate and Energy Directive. We reject any tightening of supply chain legislation by the EU.
The EU needs a genuine Commissioner for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises to ensure fair competitive conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises and to reduce bureaucracy. He or she must ensure that no regulations are introduced at EU level that cannot be implemented by SMEs and draw up proposals for the amendment or abolition of existing regulations if they place an undue burden on SMEs. In future, every legislative process should also undergo an SME test that critically examines the potential impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). After all, SMEs are the backbone of the European economy and the driving force behind growth, innovation and prosperity. We want to adapt the definition of SMEs at EU level to the reality of life. Companies with medium-sized capitalization ("small mid caps") and larger capitalization ("mid caps") should also be defined as European SMEs in the future. In addition, the employee threshold must be raised from 250 to 1,250 employees.
Overlapping reporting obligations, which result from a veritable jungle of regulations, also place an unnecessary burden on companies. We are therefore calling for a systematic reporting obligation check by the EU Commission in order to identify and merge or abolish duplicate reporting obligations. We are also calling for a standardized digital reporting portal that provides companies with relevant information in a bundled form and enables the uncomplicated central submission of reports. We are very critical of the design of the EU Supply Chain Directive, the EU Packaging Regulation, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), the extension of company-related labor market statistics to small businesses and similar projects. An EU social taxonomy for the uniform definition of socially sustainable investments and financial products should not lead to additional regulatory obligations for companies. Its application should remain voluntary. Bureaucratic burdens must be avoided, material and technological openness must be maintained and protectionist regulations must be prevented.
The effects of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, which violates international law, have made it clear what dangers unilateral dependencies pose for supply security and the economy. The EU must also become less dependent on China in particular, which is a competitor and increasingly a systemic rival. We must place the European Union's supply chains on a broader footing, especially when it comes to the supply of critical raw materials, products and technologies. To achieve this, we want to focus more on raw material and technology partnerships. Above all, it is important to us that we reduce dependencies on authoritarian and dictatorial states, which make us vulnerable to blackmail, as far as possible. New risky dependencies must
be avoided. To this end, we are calling for the EU Commission to carry out regular dependency stress tests and, in particular, to evaluate geopolitical risks and potential critical supply chain bottlenecks proactively and reduce them in consultation with companies. In the event of a crisis, we support effective immediate measures such as fast-track approval for critical goods in order to remain capable of acting. Bailing out companies at taxpayers' expense must be ruled out from the outset. We reject planned economic interventions such as production targets for companies.
Critical infrastructure must be protected from the influence of autocratic states. To this end, we want to tighten EU investment controls on foreign direct investment if it jeopardizes the security of the EU.
An important key to a sovereign EU that enables economic growth, innovation and prosperity is free trade worldwide. We Free Democrats stand for fair, rules-based and responsible trade, with a reformed World Trade Organization (WTO) as the foundation. This is all the more true in times when multilateralism is being called into question and protectionism and isolationist tendencies are on the rise worldwide. Our goal is a global free trade area of democracies. We want to gear free trade agreements more towards geostrategic aspects, focus their content on the key objectives and prevent them from being overloaded with additional issues and obligations. Trade agreements should be developed individually with our partners instead of following a "one size fits all" scheme.
We are calling for a new attempt at a free trade agreement with the USA. In view of Donald Trump's possible re-election, we want to at least conclude sectoral agreements with the current US government, for example in the areas of critical raw materials and metals or industrial tariffs. The EU Commission must make the commitment to a transatlantic economic area a priority of its work. The most important goals for a new agreement must be to abolish industrial tariffs and market access barriers, particularly for future technologies, and to define common standards, especially with regard to decarbonization, digitalization and the circular economy. The Trade and Technology Council (TTC) must create the basis for this common economic area. We also call for the TTC to be intensified in the future and expanded to include closely allied nations such as South Korea, Japan and the UK.
The trade agreement with Canada (CETA) must finally be fully ratified in all EU countries, including the regulations on investment protection. In future, investment protection and portfolio investments should be part of the EU's trade competence so that agreements such as CETA do not require unanimity. We also want to push ahead with free trade with South America. We continue to advocate the conclusion of the free trade agreement with the Mercosur states. In addition, the modernized extended framework agreement between the EU and Chile must be concluded and ratified as quickly as possible. With a view to the Middle East, we are calling for talks on a comprehensive free trade agreement with Israel to be initiated on the basis of the existing association agreement. The EU is Israel's most important trading partner. Israel has an extremely strong high-tech sector. Both sides would benefit greatly from a free trade agreement. In our cooperation with the ASEAN states, the long-term goal must be a common free trade area with the EU. We want to conclude at least one agreement with India on individual areas - the goal remains a comprehensive free trade agreement. We are striving for a free trade and investment agreement with Taiwan, without waiting for progress to be made on the agreement, which has rightly been put on ice.
investment agreement with China (CAI). As a first step, the Commission should work with our Taiwanese partners to develop a framework programme for the targeted promotion of trade and investment conditions, which should include concrete facilitations for the exchange of goods and services, the reduction of bureaucratic obstacles, the digitalization of customs formalities and the mutual recognition of degrees, licenses and standards. Particular attention should be paid to SMEs in order to fully integrate them into the exchange with Taiwan. Following the successful ratification of the EU's free trade agreement with New Zealand, the comprehensive trade agreement with Australia must also be concluded quickly. We support the bilateral negotiations between the EU and Switzerland and call for them to be brought to a swift conclusion.
We also call for the EU to place a stronger focus on negotiations on economic partnership agreements with African and Arab partner countries in the medium term. The Maghreb states should also be specifically focused on here, also in view of the refugee flows. Not only in view of the expected increase in Africa's population to 2.5 billion people in 2050 and the strategic importance of the neighboring continent of Africa for Europe's political and economic interests, it is of vital importance for the EU to focus more strongly on economic partnerships with African partner countries in order to guarantee opportunities for local people. We Free Democrats therefore call on the EU to promote cooperation with our neighboring continent in solidarity and to conclude economic cooperation agreements in the short and medium term.
We Free Democrats are committed to technological openness so that Europe's economy can survive the increasingly intense competition and remain attractive to the best researchers. We are clearly against blanket bans and in favor of competition between the best technologies. This includes the use of e-fuels for climate-friendly mobility, hydrogen in the building energy sector and the opportunities offered by fusion technology and small modular reactors (SMRs) for a secure and affordable energy supply. We want to harness the potential of genetic engineering and biotechnology. With a view to the approval of new techniques such as the CRISPR/Cas9 gene scissors, we continue to advocate the revision of genetic engineering law in a fundamentally risk- adapted and technology-open manner and to adapt it to the state of the art. We want to allow in vitro meat and milk produced using microorganisms in the EU. We reject a blanket ban on perfluorinated and polyfluorinated chemicals (PFAS). This applies in particular to non-substitutable applications, for example for the energy transition and in medicine.
We want to further develop the EU framework program for research and innovation "Horizon Europe" and expand it with clear priorities, particularly in the areas of biotechnology and genetic engineering, energy technology and information and communication technology (ICT). We support the central part of the "Investment Plan for Europe", with which the European Union is striving for an improved, more targeted use of EU budget funds. With the help of the European Investment Bank (EIB), investments are to be mobilized in this way - with a focus on infrastructure, research and development of climate-friendly technologies as well as innovations by small and medium-sized enterprises. We want to significantly expand the EIB's financing volume.
To secure further forward-looking investments and innovations, we want to strengthen "InvestEU" - by reallocating funds. With the further development of the European Innovation Council into
a European Agency for Disruptive Innovation, we want to promote disruptive innovations. We want to ensure that Europe, as the world's largest single market, is at the forefront of global research and development of future technologies.
We want to provide founders and young companies in the growth phase with sustainable financing in the EU. In particular, we want a European venture capital regulation that creates the best conditions for venture capital. This will prevent the best ideas and minds from leaving the EU because the second round of financing in particular can no longer be raised in the EU. A "Future Fund Europe" could allocate venture capital to promising companies by pooling risks accordingly. Synergies with the
"InvestEU" program and the resulting financing opportunities should be examined. We are also committed to standardizing the rules on crowdfunding in the European Union. We also want to establish an independent incubator program that stimulates and coaches large numbers of start-ups across Europe and brings them to financing via private venture capital. We call for digital freedom zones under European law: We want to create cross-border "special economic zones" for digital spin- offs, start-ups and spin-offs through experimental spaces and opening clauses. We want to expand the legal forms of European company law (European Private Company [SPE], European Association) in order to provide companies with better framework conditions and more suitable legal forms.
A Europe that protects freedom, diversity and self-determination
- Simply. Make.
For us Free Democrats, the freedom of the individual in responsibility for others is paramount. It is inextricably linked to a diverse, self-determined and open society. We see the EU as a community of values that must protect the freedom of the individual. This is what we are fighting for in Europe:
We all benefit politically, economically and culturally from freedom of travel and unrestricted mobility in the Schengen area. In principle, we want a Europe in which people can travel freely and without border controls. However, the prerequisite for open internal borders is strong, effective protection of the EU's external borders. We are committed to appropriate border protection measures and modern security technology to monitor the border area at the EU's external borders. It must be ensured that refugees and migrants who have already been in a safe third country return there. We Free Democrats call for a faster expansion of the EU border protection agency Frontex to the planned number of 10,000 staff. This must be accompanied by structural reforms and an expansion of control and transparency mechanisms. Frontex should also take over sea rescue operations in the Mediterranean, both to save people from drowning and to prevent illegal border crossings. Ideally, by bringing people safely to places where their asylum applications are examined and decided before they enter the European Union, in order to ensure that those whose asylum applications are rejected are denied entry.
Europe is in urgent need of immigration into the labor market. The EU and its member states must create the conditions for bright minds to decide to immigrate to Europe. In order to increase the acceptance of regular immigration into the labor market among the population in Europe, Europe must get to grips with the problem of irregular migration. We defend the right to protection from persecution, but those who have no chance of a right to stay in the EU should not be allowed to enter in the first place. The irregular migration of people with no prospect of a right to stay in Europe is an enormous challenge for the EU and the confidence of its citizens in its ability to act. In many places, reception capacities have long been exhausted and local authorities are overburdened. Citizens feel the associated problems in their everyday lives and rightly expect solutions. We Free Democrats want to consistently implement the course of the new realpolitik in migration and continue to drive it forward - for more control and order. The EU and its member states must make a success of the fundamental EU asylum reform and prove that they can effectively reduce irregular migration, especially with faster asylum procedures and consistent returns. Because our capacities are limited. Those who emigrate for purely economic reasons are not entitled to asylum in the EU. This is the only way we can offer refuge to people fleeing war and persecution who really need our help. Uniform conditions should prevent secondary migration within the EU. We advocate the establishment of European asylum centers at the EU's external border to ensure an efficient and rapid asylum procedure while maintaining humanitarian standards. We want asylum seekers to be transferred to safe third countries for the asylum procedure and to be accommodated in the third country until their asylum application is recognized - while guaranteeing humanitarian standards and the rule of law.
We want to implement the United Nations' pact for safe, orderly and regular migration at European level. European development cooperation must primarily tackle the causes of flight preventively and thus mitigate them in the long term. We advocate the establishment of humanitarian protection zones in agreement with the respective countries and with EU funding. We want to enable asylum applications to be examined in third countries. This would allow those affected to determine whether they have prospects of remaining in the EU and, if necessary, to avoid a dangerous flight. Of course, in compliance with the Geneva Refugee Convention and fundamental and human rights.
The values of the Union - freedom, democracy and the rule of law - are the foundation on which the EU is built. Anyone who tramples on the rule of law must have their EU funding withdrawn quickly and consistently. In future, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) should be able to freeze EU funds at the request of a member state, the Commission or the Parliament. We want to extend the legal mechanism to violations of all EU values, regardless of whether EU funds are involved.
We call for a European fundamental rights complaint. Citizens and legal entities should be given improved opportunities to take legal action against EU legal acts before the European Court of Justice. After exhausting national legal remedies, they must also be able to take legal action against national legal acts that violate their European fundamental rights. We want to further promote and expand the successful work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO).
Europol must be developed into a European Criminal Police Office. The authority must be able to coordinate and support the work of the Member States with effective investigative powers in cross- border matters and in the area of security.
We want a Europe of diversity. The protection of minorities within a democratic community is a prerequisite and a concern of the rule of law. National minorities within the EU have a right to maintain and pass on their culture and language. People of a different skin color or with a migration background must not be subject to discrimination. Everyday discrimination and even more so the systematic exclusion of minorities have no place in Europe. We demand that LGBTIQ demonstrations can take place unhindered and safely throughout the EU. There must be no restrictions on providing factual information about the lives of LGBTIQ people anywhere in the EU. We demand that same-sex marriages concluded within the EU and established parenthoods be recognized with all rights and obligations in the European member states. Reproductive rights such as egg donation and altruistic surrogacy must be respected in other EU member states if they have been legally exercised in one EU member state and must not be criminalized for their citizens. For us, "persecution on grounds of sexual identity" remains a reason for asylum in Europe. In future, EU legislation against discrimination based on racism must also cover homophobia and other forms of discrimination. Neither member states nor candidate countries should be given a discount when it comes to respecting the civil rights of LGBTIQ people. EU funds to the countries concerned must be frozen in the event of violations.
We call for swift and consistent responses to attacks on press freedom by EU member states. In our view, independent media supervision in the Union and the member states is crucial. This is precisely why we are committed to improving the proposed media freedom law. Civil society organizations such as the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom (ECPMF) should be empowered to advocate for freedom of the press and freedom of expression and the protection of media professionals throughout Europe.
Freedom of expression and artistic freedom also apply online. That is why we want to abolish the
obligation to use up- ad filters.
We want to create an area of data freedom and data security. We will work to ensure that European research funds are used specifically for research into data protection technologies and infrastructure. The goal should be a largely self-sufficient Europe with its own cloud providers, including private ones, and European data protection standards. We want to abolish the retention of air passenger data, which is contrary to fundamental rights, in order to protect the data of travelers in the European Union.
For us, the protection of privacy and the right to encryption as well as anonymity in digital spaces are indispensable. We categorically reject network blocking, chat control, data retention and spying on citizens without cause. Instead, we must invest in equipping the police and Europol.
We Free Democrats see a functioning European data protection system with data sovereignty and informational self-determination for citizens as the basis for a fair and fairer society.
and a functioning data economy. We want to make the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) less bureaucratic and develop it further.
We want to digitize the administration in the Member States. To this end, we want to strengthen a European digital identity and oblige the Member States to provide certain administrative services digitally, quickly and unbureaucratically.
We do not accept that women are still disadvantaged in our society. We are committed to improving the compatibility of work and care work - by expanding affordable childcare and making working hours more flexible. We want to improve the compatibility of politics and family life and enable MEPs to vote online after the birth or adoption of a child. We want to promote the career advancement of women and girls through improved STEM education, entrepreneurship education and by supporting private female founders networks. We are committed to ensuring that the remaining countries ratify the Istanbul Convention on combating violence against women and that all countries implement the convention. We demand that the right to health care with safe abortion must be guaranteed in Europe and that reproductive rights must be respected in all member states. We are in favor of a Europe-wide endometriosis action plan.
We Free Democrats want to reform EU law in order to enable the Member States to release cannabis in a controlled manner and pursue an independent drug policy.
A Europe that strengthens freedom, security and democracy worldwide - Simply. Make.
We Free Democrats are committed to ensuring that Europe finds a common response to the realities of foreign and security policy. Because these have changed more fundamentally since the last European elections five years ago than at any time since the Second World War. This is what we are fighting for in Europe:
Russia is waging a war of aggression against Ukraine, which is striving for freedom and democracy, in violation of international law. We remain firmly on the side of the Ukrainians. Ukraine must win the war and regain its territorial integrity and sovereignty. To achieve this, the EU must continue to provide Ukraine with greater humanitarian, financial, economic and military support - including the additional delivery of urgently needed weapons systems such as the Taurus cruise missile. To this end, the capacities of the European arms industry must be increased.
The FDP is committed to a coordinated international reconstruction of Ukraine. The frozen Russian assets should be used for this purpose. The EU is therefore called upon to seek all constitutional possibilities to use the frozen Russian state assets and frozen Russian private assets, insofar as their owners are (co-)responsible for the war of aggression in violation of international law or have benefited from it, for the reconstruction of Ukraine.
and to ensure the reconstruction of Ukraine. Reconstruction and the European integration process must be closely linked from the outset. The EU must support Ukraine even more in the implementation of structural reforms. The focus here is on combating corruption. We support Ukraine's prospects of joining NATO, as set out in the resolutions of the NATO summits of 2008 and 2023. This is because NATO membership for Ukraine is the best guarantee of security and contributes to securing freedom and peace in Europe.
We demand the isolation of Russia in multilateral organizations. Economic sanctions must be extended to a complete embargo and personal sanctions including visa withdrawals and deportation must be imposed. The FDP supports investigations by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the creation of a special tribunal for the crime of aggressive war. Vladimir Putin and high-ranking Russian officials must be held criminally accountable. We stand firmly by the Russian opposition, which is committed to a free, constitutional and liberal Russia.
We Free Democrats are committed to the universality of human rights as the basis of a free society. We want an EU that takes decisive action against human rights violations, oppression and group- based hostility, works closely with the human rights institutions of the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations and plays a pioneering role in the protection of international law. For example, in the case of stricter penalties against lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals, intersexuals and queer people (LGBTIQ), development cooperation should be put to the test in dialog with local NGOs, budget support should be withdrawn if necessary and cooperation with state institutions should be terminated.
Decisions in the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) should in future be taken by a qualified majority. The High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy must be institutionally upgraded to an EU Foreign Minister. This minister should be responsible for all central areas of European foreign policy and coordinate to ensure greater coherence and efficiency for the EU and its member states. In addition, a political deputy for defense and security policy is to be appointed, who, like the High Representative himself, is to have the rank of Commissioner. The European External Action Service (EEAS) is to be strengthened as an important substructure so that we speak with one voice vis-à-vis allies, competitors and authoritarian states. We want to strengthen the EU so that it can act in a strategically networked manner in foreign and security policy issues at all times and at all levels. To this end, the EU's strategic compass must be pursued more consistently.
The aim is to create a European Defense Union as an intermediate step towards a European army under joint supreme command and parliamentary control. The military capabilities within the framework of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) are to be coordinated and pooled more strongly at European level. We want to expand the European Defense Fund (EDF) as well as joint arms procurement. We are committed to harmonizing arms export regulations in Europe. Arms exports to democratic partners such as NATO countries, Australia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea and Ukraine should be uncomplicated.
the EU. We want to strengthen the European pillar of NATO and thus the joint political capacity of the EU partners in the alliance. That is why we are committed to prosperous and effective relations between NATO and the EU and ensure a division and prioritization that corresponds to the competencies and realities.
The EU's efforts for security and protection in space must be significantly increased. To this end, we want to strengthen the resilience of satellite-based communication, information, navigation and earth observation.
We advocate the establishment of a European Security Council (ESC) chaired by the High Representative. The ESR would be responsible for agenda-setting and the preparation of opinions and recommendations on strategic issues. The EU Intelligence Analysis Center (EU INTCEN) is also to be developed into an effective European intelligence service. The member states are to share intelligence information as a matter of principle.
Japan, South Korea, India and the democratic ASEAN states should be an even greater focus of European foreign policy in Asia. This also applies to Australia and New Zealand. In addition to intensifying economic relations, shaping the global future requires even closer cooperation on climate and species protection, sustainable energy production, securing resources, security and connectivity.
We advocate an EU strategy towards China that is shaped by our values. China is a systemic and economic rival. We want to improve our competitive position vis-à-vis the People's Republic of China and become more economically independent. We want to strengthen strategic initiatives such as Global Gateway in response to the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. Human rights crimes such as the mass internment and forced sterilization of Uyghurs must be sanctioned. Critical technologies must not fall into the hands of system rivals such as China. We want to coordinate closely with the G7 by reviving the Coordination Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom). We also want to examine whether export controls need to be tightened and whether outbound investment screening is necessary. Unnecessary trade barriers must be avoided.
The supply of critical raw materials and energy must be diversified both internationally and through domestic production. Germany going it alone against the interests of our European partners with Nord Stream 1 and 2 was a serious mistake. This was demonstrated not least by the difficulty in responding to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Europe must not make itself vulnerable. Our response is a common foreign energy policy that establishes energy partnerships with reliable countries. We are striving for a hydrogen partnership with Israel in particular. We therefore support the plans to build a pipeline from Israel through the Mediterranean to the European continent. This will make it possible to diversify energy sources and reduce energy dependencies on individual suppliers.
For us Free Democrats, Israel's right to exist and defend itself is non-negotiable. We stand unreservedly by Israel's side and are committed to ensuring that the EU does the same. EU-
Aid funds must not be misused for terror and anti-Semitism. Individuals and organizations that commit or support terror against Israel must be sanctioned. To this end, we call for a global sanctions regime against anti-Israeli terror.
UNRWA has not been able to decisively change the situation in the last 75 years. The organization has clearly outlived its usefulness. Recent incidents have shown that internal reforms are not enough. Instead, the United Nations must reposition itself in the region and allow UNRWA to merge with established structures such as UNHCR, UNDP and WFP. Until UNRWA is transferred to the structures of UNHCR, UNDP, WFP and others, the resumption of payments is only possible in close coordination with Israel and the USA.
We Free Democrats continue to advocate a negotiated two-state solution.
We Free Democrats stand firmly by Taiwan's side. Together with our value partners in the region, we want to advocate stability in the Taiwan Strait at all levels and expand cooperation with Taiwan. We support Taiwan's integration into international organizations. Our goal is for China and Taiwan to reach an agreement in peaceful dialog to enable the citizens of Taiwan to freely decide on their political future.
Furthermore, we must not leave Africa, including the Middle East, and Latin America, as emerging continents, to countries such as Russia or China. We are committed to ensuring that Europe supports the African Union in implementing its visions for Agenda 2063 and a free trade area (AfCFTA). The EU also needs more trade and investment agreements with African countries in order to increase export opportunities and imports of raw materials and energy. We want to develop cultural persuasiveness by massively expanding exchange programs such as Erasmus+ with a focus on countries of the Global South.
A Europe that guarantees the ability to act and sound finances - Simply. Make.
We Free Democrats want to create strong and effective EU institutions through courageous reforms, complete the economic and monetary union and secure sound finances across Europe. This is what we are fighting for in Europe:
We are calling for a smaller Commission with 18 ministers and a Parliament with a seat in Brussels, the right to make proposals to the Commission President and the power to initiate legislation. As a first step, the next Commission must make a voluntary commitment to introduce a legislative initiative at the request of Parliament. The EU Direct Elections Act should introduce a voting age of 16, European electoral lists, a common election day and the Spitzenkandidaten principle, but should dispense with a gender quota. We advocate that a convention should draw up a federal or federal- state constitution for the European Union, to be voted on in a pan-European referendum.
The EU's enlargement policy needs more realism. It must also be accompanied by institutional reforms so that the EU becomes receptive. The prospect of EU accession is a key instrument for securing democracy, internal and external security, political stability and economic prosperity on our continent in the long term. In this regard, we support the resolutions of the European Council of December 14, 2023. It goes without saying that the candidates must meet all the criteria before joining. We want to support the countries on this path so that their contribution is a success that strengthens the EU both internally and externally. A special focus must be placed on the rule of law. A Turkey under the authoritarian rule of President Erdogan cannot be a candidate for EU membership. We therefore want to end the EU accession negotiations with Turkey in their current form and place relations on a new basis of close security and economic cooperation. Following the conclusion of the Windsor Agreement, we want to deepen the new partnership between the EU and the UK wherever possible. We Free Democrats are also in favor of enabling flexible integration so that some states can take further steps towards integration. At the same time, the door will always remain open for the other member states.
We stand for sound finances. With the FDP, there will be no entry into a debt union. In the coming legislative period, Europe must begin to repay the loans taken out for the Corona Solidarity Fund as agreed. We reject Eurobonds. As in the past, the EU's revenue should mainly come from transfers from member states, measured according to their economic strength. For us, the fight against inflation has top priority. Policies at EU level and in the Member States must provide the best possible support for the ECB's fight against inflation. This includes a budgetary policy that refrains from further debt-financed economic stimulus programs. For the same reason, credible debt reduction in highly indebted member states must be a priority in the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. The agreement reached by the Member States in December 2023 on the initiative of French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on new fiscal rules while retaining the Maastricht criteria is therefore a major success for financial stability in the EU.
For EU budget policy, we call for restraint in the creation of new own resources. In particular, we reject new own resources based on statistical corporate profits and instead call for the repayment of the European Union's NextGenerationEU liabilities from the EU's general budget. Of course, this does not affect the Member States' obligations to the EU. The EU's indebtedness in the context of NextGenerationEU ("corona bonds") must remain a one-off exception and the EU must return to the debt ban. The EU budget must be consistently geared towards investment in the future. Inflation can only be overcome in the long term by creating additional supply. This includes deepening the single market - especially for labor, energy, capital and digital services - reducing bureaucracy and barriers to investment and concluding new free trade agreements.
We want to complete the Economic and Monetary Union and deepen the Capital Markets Union. The Capital Markets Union is a booster for private investment. That is why the FDP supports the so- called Listing Act, which facilitates access to stock market financing for start-ups and medium-sized companies. We also want to make it easier for private investors to access the capital market. That is why we have
In the European Parliament, we voted against a ban on rebates in securities trading (Payment for Or- der Flow, PFOF), which would weaken low-cost and innovative competitors. We are calling for an adjustment for a fair and transparent coexistence of commission and fee-based advice for investors and we are committed to ensuring that experienced private investors can be offered a wider range of products with fewer bureaucratic requirements than before.
Cash is freedom. That is why we are committed to the unrestricted preservation of cash as a means of payment in the European Union and reject uniform cash ceilings. We constructively support the introduction of a digital euro as a supplement to the existing cash. As digital cash, the digital euro should be usable both offline and online. At the same time, the privacy of citizens must remain fully protected. There must be no compulsion to use the digital euro and there must be no additional risks for the financial system. At the same time, we want to make the common market in Europe attractive for cryptocurrencies and positively support their development.
A Europe that grows together in a digital, climate-neutral and modern way - Simply. Make.
We Free Democrats want to turn Europe into a continent of digital opportunities, achieve energy security and effective climate protection through technological openness and a market economy and align the European infrastructure for the future. This is what we are fighting for in Europe:
We are committed to expanding the digital single market and breaking down national barriers. We want to make it easier to scale digital business models and establish cross-border start-ups. To this end, we want to ensure a uniform interpretation of the law by a European Digital Single Market Authority. Citizens must be able to travel throughout the EU with a digital identity that can be used easily and interoperably for public and private sector services. We defend the principle of net neutrality in the European Union. Audiovisual content should also be included in the scope of the Geoblocking Regulation in future. We are committed to modern licensing and monetization models. We want to create a European mobile communications area in which consumers can use mobile communications contracts from all member states throughout Europe and without restriction. We want to extend freedom of roaming to all candidate countries. In an increasingly insecure world, Europe must be able to protect critical infrastructure from foreign interference. We are therefore calling for common security standards for digital infrastructure. Components from companies that are subject to the influence of authoritarian regimes must not be installed in the digital critical infrastructure (e.g. 5G network).
We want to make the EU a hotspot for artificial intelligence that serves people's life chances instead of disempowering them. That is why we reject conservative surveillance wishes and left-wing over- regulation fantasies in equal measure. The FDP is committed to an unbureaucratic and practical implementation of the European AI regulation that enables innovation
and civil rights. For AI training data, we advocate a fair use principle based on the American model. We want to strengthen the competitiveness of the European AI economy and enable modern monetization models for rights holders.
We want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees if possible. The FDP relies on emissions trading and technological openness to achieve the European climate targets. Emissions trading is the most effective and efficient climate protection instrument, as it sets a clear greenhouse gas limit. By 2035, we want to merge the ETS 1 and 2 systems to make them even more efficient and include remaining emission sources such as waste and agriculture. The medium-term goal is uniform CO2 pricing. We reject piecemeal regulations such as the Ecodesign Regulation and the Ecodesign Directive or additional CO2 pricing through energy taxes. This applies in particular to the building sector: ETS 2 leads to cost-effective refurbishment where the CO2 avoidance costs are lowest. We want to ensure that the resulting technological openness is not jeopardized by other regulations. We therefore strictly reject additional regulatory measures such as the European Building Efficiency Directive (EPBD) and the CO2 fleet limits. We will abolish the fleet limits without replacement. In addition to emissions trading, framework conditions for the development of infrastructure are completely sufficient. We are calling for a regulatory pause in the Green Deal. Companies first need sufficient leeway to implement the targets that have already been set.
Climate protection can only succeed internationally. Europe plays a central role both in international negotiations and in domestic climate protection. The aim must therefore be to establish an international emissions trading system as quickly as possible. To this end, the established climate club must be expanded and supplemented by an agreement on the harmonization of a uniform emissions trading system. Europe must also strengthen the climate protection efforts of other countries. This is a matter of equal footing. That is why international guidelines on the use of different technologies are out of the question. Instead, we must strengthen the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in accordance with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and also meet our climate targets by using these certificates.
We are committed to innovation-friendly regulation of the extraction, use and storage of CO2. Narrow-minded debates about the priority of CO2 avoidance over Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) are only delaying the market ramp-up. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has already made it clear that the use of these technologies is indispensable for achieving the climate targets. We are creating an additional incentive by rewarding negative emissions with free CO2 certificates. We also want to add a separate negative emissions target to the EU climate target. Anyone who removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere through reforestation or technical methods should receive a free certificate without increasing the total amount of certificates. CO2 sequestration in the agricultural sector must also be taken into account.
In order to accelerate the expansion of infrastructure and renewable energies, we are setting the course at EU level for a further acceleration of planning and approval procedures. To this end, we want to limit environmental impact assessments (EIAs) to projects with a cross-border environmental impact. We want to remove obstacles to speeding up planning under European law by giving the Member States more leeway. For example, many projects require an EIA, the cost of which is often disproportionate to the benefit.
For the energy transition, we need a new market-based electricity market design to enable a carbon-neutral, secure and cost-effective energy supply. We want long-term contracts to become more accessible for small companies. The local availability of electricity should play a role in pricing. Energy storage and renewable energies must be integrated into the market and manage without state aid. Incentives must be created for the flexible provision and use of electricity. The electricity grid between the Member States must be expanded and the European internal energy market created.
Nuclear fusion offers the potential to generate energy safely and in a climate-neutral way in the future. We want to create an innovation-friendly legal framework for nuclear fusion outside of nuclear law that takes into account the lower risks of this technology. Hydrogen and synthetic fuels offer great opportunities as the energy storage systems of the future. Regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles that hinder the rapid ramp-up of hydrogen must be removed. We want to prevent the forced unbundling of gas and hydrogen grid operation, as this would massively hinder infrastructure conversion. Alternative fuels, such as e-fuels, should be permitted both as pure fuel and as an admixture. This is because combustion engines are not harmful to the climate per se, but their operation with fossil fuels is. In order to make the fleet of over one billion vehicles with combustion engines worldwide more climate-friendly, we are therefore focusing on replacing fossil fuels with synthetic fuels and committing to the combustion engine as part of people's mobility. We want to make combustion engines climate-friendly, not ban them.
In order to preserve biodiversity, it is necessary to take evidence-based measures and evaluate them regularly using verifiable criteria. Biodiversity certificates, such as those introduced in Australia, could also provide market incentives here. The populations of many protected animal species have increased massively in many places in recent years. Where these animal species cause significant conflicts with the use of nature or the protection of other species, it must be possible to regulate the population sensibly. This applies in particular to the wolf. We want to lower the protection status of the wolf for those regions in which a healthy conservation status has been achieved.
We want to expand cooperation between the EU and the World Health Organization and resolutely drive forward the implementation of the EU's global health strategy. We want to create a common European health data space that improves care, enables innovation and meets data protection requirements. We want to reduce bureaucracy in the healthcare sector and speed up approval procedures without compromising patient safety. In order to ensure access to medicinal products for rare diseases, the European benefit assessment must take into account their special features in a practical way. Overly bureaucratic procedures disproportionately affect small manufacturers in particular and lead to medical products being withdrawn from the market. With the joint purchase of vaccines, the first major joint procurement of the European Union in the health sector has taken place. We believe it makes sense to use the importance of the European Single Market for increased joint procurement in the medical sector in order to ensure security of supply.
We Free Democrats see the driver's license as freedom in action. It enables mobility, especially in rural areas. That is why we want to lower the minimum age for obtaining a car driving license and
allow accompanied driving from the age of 16. This demonstrably leads to greater road safety. At the same time, we reject restrictions for senior citizens through mandatory regular health tests as a prerequisite for renewing a driving license. These discriminate against older people, who demonstrably have lower accident rates than other age groups.
The FDP is committed to fair competitive conditions on the European railways. This requires free access to all European rail networks and a separation of network and operations. We want to make a corresponding attempt to further develop the existing rail passports. Furthermore, we are committed to the consistent expansion of the trans-European rail networks into high-performance and high- speed corridors. The goal is a European high-speed network. Rail networks and ticketing systems should be harmonized, network and operation separated and the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) introduced across the board. We also want to create an EU standard for maglev trains.
We want to make aviation climate-neutral by 2050 without bans and additional taxes and levies. The instruments for pricing CO2 emissions in aviation are emissions trading and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). We want to improve the framework conditions for the use of air cabs and drones.
The production of high-quality food on our own doorstep is in our own best interests. The work of farmers deserves our appreciation. Respect for property and entrepreneurial responsibility must be the guiding principle of European agricultural policy. We call for a market-based Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that is less characterized by subsidy payments and excessive bureaucracy. Too often in the past, restrictions were imposed on agriculture for ideological reasons, which were compensated for with money. However, good agricultural policy also exists without money. We therefore want to gradually reduce area-based direct payments under the first pillar over a period of 15 years. In return, we will improve competitive conditions and radically reduce bureaucracy. It must be ensured that all EU countries meet the same standards and that the same production conditions exist. EU directives must therefore be transposed into national law without additional bureaucracy. This is the only way that agriculture can remain viable for the future and successfully assert itself on the market under equal competitive conditions. This includes, among other things, the withdrawal of mandatory set-asides.
The extensive legal requirements, regulations and resulting inspections lead to a considerable amount of bureaucracy for agricultural businesses, which also restricts the initiative of farmers. The European Union must work resolutely to reduce bureaucratic hurdles. The once-only principle should be applied here.
We do not want low animal welfare standards to lead to a competitive advantage. That is why we need Europe-wide minimum standards for animal welfare that do not overburden small and medium-sized farms. We want to fundamentally simplify the EU marketing standards for fruit and vegetables. Instead of the external appearance, the quality of the product alone should be decisive. We want to enable innovations in agriculture such as genetic engineering through rapid and scientifically sound approval procedures. In the use and approval of plant protection products
we clearly oppose ideological prejudgement and blanket restrictions. The approval of individual substances or groups of substances must not be arbitrary, but must be based on scientifically sound standards.
We advocate a complete reorganization of European genetic engineering law. Not only must the assessment of traditional green genetic engineering be adapted to the current state of knowledge, but so-called new breeding techniques, such as genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 , must also be regulated in a progress-oriented and legally clear manner. The aim must be to evaluate the product and not the method of production. New breeding techniques in particular offer environmentally friendly solutions with highly precise and cost-effective biotechnological interventions. Resistant plants can significantly reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers.
We want a European fisheries policy that combines sustainability, social justice and economic stability on an equal footing. We reject efforts by the European Commission to increasingly subject recreational angling to the requirements of the Common Fisheries Policy and close-meshed data collection.
European election program
2024
until 2029
Strong Germany
A strong team
... are we, the members of the top team for the FREIES WÄHLER in Europe. We bring together expertise from local politics, agriculture, small and medium-sized businesses and the world of finance. All of this is needed in the European Parliament in order to shape a European policy that offers Germany more opportunities than risks. We stand for a liberal policy that respects the democratic principle of subsidiarity and in which extremism of any kind has no place. We stand for diversity and tolerance, for performance and commitment and for justice and fairness.
A strong Germany
... means for us, above all, a Germany that is aware of its great responsibility in Europe and also assumes this responsibility. Our work, our commitment and our arguments are aimed at representing our Germany as the part of Europe that contributes significantly to the strength of the European Union and the part of the European Union that takes the lead and plays a pioneering role - a pioneer, for example, in the development of new key technologies in the areas of energy transition, digitalization and agriculture. In Germany's key industries, the EU has sometimes been more of an obstacle than a support in recent years. We want to openly represent German interests here. We stand by the side of the self-employed and entrepreneurs in our country.
A strong Europe
... means for us, above all, a European Union that is once again strategically capable of representing and defending our values and interests in the world and that secures peace, our security and our prosperity. Europe's importance in the world has declined in recent years: the current situation is characterized by dwindling economic competitiveness, unresolved fundamental differences between member states, particularly in financial and migration policy, neglected education policy and digitalization and, last but not least, significant external dependence in terms of military security, energy and pharmaceutical supplies. Europe must be put back on a course that restores the economic power of the European Union to its former strength.
Our aim is to ensure that the voice of freedom, science and reason is strengthened in the next European Parliament and that right-wing and left-wing populists do not jeopardize the functioning of the European Union in the long term.

We FREIE WÄHLER are a force in the political center that has grown out of the reality of our citizens' lives. They are the ones who shape us with their commitment, and it is their liberal democratic values that we represent.
As FREIE WÄHLER, we act pragmatically and without ideology. We reject any extremes, be it on a political, social, cultural or religious level. We see ourselves as defenders of a diverse society and therefore promote coexistence and civic engagement. We constantly strive to bring people together and make their voices heard. In view of the current challenges, we want to implement the best solutions. We therefore actively counteract the fragmentation of society and see ourselves as preservers of the free and democratic order in Germany and Europe.
We stand for more personal responsibility in our society. We want to counteract the division in society. We stand for the promotion of a respectful culture of debate - including on social media. We stand together against an increasing social cancel culture.
Our aspiration is a free Europe that tackles the challenges of the present and future pragmatically and without ideology. A Europe that sees itself as the servant of its sovereign, the people, and focuses on their well-being. Fundamental values such as democracy, the rule of law, human rights, freedom of the press and freedom of expression are non-negotiable for us. We will demand that all member states and candidate countries respect and promote these values at European level.
The major challenges of our complex world can only be mastered together at European level. The aim is to create the best Europe for all citizens.
Europe as a community of values
Europe is a community of values that has its roots in Western Christian culture, which has been shaped by humanist, Jewish and Enlightenment influences. We want to preserve and promote this cultural diversity. We cannot imagine a Europe without freedom, democracy and the rule of law. We will always stand up for these values and actively demand that they are upheld.
Europe's importance in the world has declined in recent years. Dwindling economic competitiveness, unresolved fundamental differences between the member states - particularly in financial and migration policy - neglected education policy and digitalization and, last but not least, significant external dependence - concerning military security, energy supply or the supply of medicines, for example - characterize the present.
However, the major challenges of our time do not only concern relations with non-European powers or countries, but many problems also remain unresolved within the EU.
Guarantee equal rights
We FREIE WÄHLER are committed to a Europe that values the dignity of every citizen and guarantees it without restriction. Any form of discrimination
4
We reject discrimination on the basis of gender, descent, language, homeland and origin, faith, religious or political views, as well as on the basis of impairments. Our fundamental European values are non-negotiable for us. Countries outside and within the EU where European values are not upheld must be confronted more resolutely.
Defending fundamental rights effectively
The Europe we want to live in is value-based and a protective shield for all its citizens. The existing rule of law mechanism must therefore be strictly applied. If individual member states break the rules, we also want to create the possibility of financial sanctions in the EU budget so that EU funding can be withdrawn. As a last resort, measures such as exclusion from the eurozone or the EU must also be considered in the event of repeated violations. Sanctions against individual EU member states must not lead to cities and municipalities as well as civil society initiatives within the member state having to forego European funding. We therefore want to create the instrument of direct funding for such cases.
Securing peace and freedom
We are committed to the realization of a united Europe. Social conflicts are intensifying the political discourse in many member states. Extreme parties are gaining ground in Europe and debates today are often irreconcilable and ideological. As guardians of the democratic and liberal order, we want to mediate between different interests in order to achieve a pragmatic and objective consensus for the benefit of all citizens. Europe is a continent of peace and freedom. We will therefore do everything necessary to preserve, protect and promote this.
Protect minorities
We call for active protection of minorities in Europe. Minorities are repeatedly discriminated against or even openly attacked. Anti-Semitism, antiziganism and attacks on people with a migrant background are not developments that we accept in silence. We will actively combat this misanthropy. It does not matter whether it is individual attacks or structural discrimination. We are calling for a new, more ambitious EU strategy with sanctions to protect minorities in all member states.
Promoting the German language in Europe
We see linguistic and cultural diversity as a great European strength with integrative power and want to protect and strengthen it. Dialects, regional and minority languages, such as those of the German minority in Poland, are identity-forming and therefore worth protecting. With over 100 million German-speaking citizens in the EU, we are calling for the introduction of German as an equal European working language.
Strengthening Europe's role in the world
The global balance of power has shifted. The liberal-democratic social model of the West has noticeably lost its appeal and influence. Autocratic systems are on the rise worldwide. We want to strengthen Europe's role in this conflict of social systems. The aim must be to maintain global competitiveness at all levels, from the economy to defense. At the same time, Europe must remain an anchor for peace and freedom in the world and actively and pragmatically defend its values.
5
Enforcing European values on the Internet
We are open to technological developments, but also always keep an eye on their consequences for the way we live together. One of the most important developments is the Internet, which has become a matter of course for many citizens. The virtual world is not a legal vacuum. Many laws on the Internet are in need of improvement. We must be in a position to better prosecute violations of these laws.
Preserving living culture
The EU complements the policies of the member states in the area of culture. The focus here is on the preservation of European cultural heritage and the promotion of cross-border cooperation between cultural institutions and creative artists. European cultural funding must be maintained. In order for more citizens to be able to take advantage of this funding, the application options must be made less bureaucratic and more widely advertised. We see culture as a living process, which is why new forms of cultural activity must also be considered for funding. Culture is evolutionary and an expression of the regional socio-cultural environment.
Preserve diversity
We advocate a Europe in which all people can live freely, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity. The goal formulated by the EU of creating an area of freedom, security and justice must be implemented for all people. The EU has already significantly improved the living situation of LGBTIQ* people in many countries. In some countries, however, attempts are being made to reverse the achievements of recent years. We therefore call for an increase in funding for educational work and the "Program for the Promotion of Diversity". In addition, we call for the recognition of registered partnerships and same-sex marriages in all member states, in line with the case law of the European Court of Justice.
Europe as Citizens' democracy
Political decision-making processes and their results are often perceived by many people as non-transparent and distant from their own lives. However, they often have a considerable influence on local life in cities and municipalities. The lobbying scandals of recent years, such as the corruption scandal surrounding the deposed EU Vice-President Kaili, undermine people's trust in the EU. Legislative initiatives that are alien to life, such as the planned Europe-wide obligation to renovate buildings, are also damaging the reputation of the European institutions.
We urgently need to counter this loss of acceptance. We need to regain lost trust. Europe can only be preserved and strengthened through fundamental reforms. We FREIE WÄHLER want to actively support and steer these processes.
Our goal is a Europe of citizens, not a Europe of functionaries and decisions far removed from reality. We want an EU in which political processes are transparent, decisions are made in the interests of the people and the sovereign is not only involved, but actively participates in decision-making. This EU should take care of the big questions and issues of the future and let local people shape their own lives.
6
We stand for a Europe of citizens and regions - and oppose a centralist direction. Europe must concentrate on the important tasks: securing peace, prosperity and security.
Introduce referendums on European issues
We are a grassroots democratic movement that is firmly anchored in the cities and municipalities. For us, it goes without saying that citizens should also be heard on European issues. We therefore advocate referendums on important European policy issues at federal level. Citizens must have a say in EU enlargements and further deepening in the sense of new transfers of tasks.
Strengthening the European Citizens' Initiative
We want to further strengthen the European Citizens' Initiative (EIB). It enables committed citizens to put forward their political ideas in Europe. We want to expand the application possibilities of the instrument and create the possibility of binding Europe-wide citizens' decisions.
Extending the rights of the European Parliament
The European Parliament is the only directly elected institution in the European context. We want to further strengthen it by striving to expand its competences and responsibilities. We want a genuine right of initiative for the European Parliament in order to be able to bring the interests of citizens directly into the European legislative process.
Creating a fairer distribution of seats
The distribution of seats in the European Parliament does not currently correspond to the population share of the countries in Europe. As a result, a German vote is worth less than that of a voter from a smaller member state. We want the distribution of seats in the European Parliament to be based as closely as possible on the principle of "one man, one vote". For this reason, we also oppose the current deliberations on percentage hurdles in the European elections.
Making lobbying transparent
We want to make the influence of all non-parliamentary interest groups on the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers transparent and thus expose any influence that does not correspond to democratic values. To this end, we advocate a revision of the EU lobby register.
Limiting the competences of the EU
Due to our roots in local politics, we know that local challenges often require individual solutions. The EU should therefore only be responsible if a task cannot be better tackled at federal, state or municipal level in the member states. The EU must focus on core issues such as migration and security policy or the promotion of the internal market. We are therefore committed to clarifying the responsibilities of the EU and member states in the European treaties.
Focusing on topics of the future
The challenges of the changing global times cannot be solved nationally. These include dealing with digitalization and artificial intelligence, the rise of China and India as competitors on global markets, the loss of competitiveness, political instability within the EU and the rise of extreme parties worldwide. The
7
The preservation of natural resources, energy security and the persistently high migration pressure must become the focus of European policy considerations. Too often, the EU revolves around itself.
Revise the principle of unanimity
We value Europe's diversity. However, this occasionally leads to fundamentally divergent interests clashing. We therefore advocate replacing the unanimity principle with democratic majority decisions in certain areas of European policy.
Promoting transparency and thoroughness
We want the European Parliament to make full use of its negotiating leeway in the three planned readings. The shortened procedure, which has become the rule, should only be used in really urgent cases. We want to achieve maximum transparency in the negotiations with the EU Commission and the Council of Ministers. In addition, society as a whole must be better involved in future EU legislation.
Elect EU Commission in Parliament
We want to drastically reduce the size of the Commission. We believe that a maximum of ten portfolios is sufficient to shape Europe effectively. The focus must always be on the concerns of citizens. We also want European municipalities to have a central point of contact at the EU Commission. In order to achieve far-reaching democratization of the EU institutions, the Commissioners must be elected by the Parliament in future. To this end, the European treaties must be adapted accordingly.
Reorganize EU management staff
The balance of power between the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the President of the Eurogroup and the President of the Council of Ministers has not yet been sufficiently clarified and balanced. We continue to advocate a clarification and reduction of the leadership personnel to fewer, but more effective offices.
Respect the principle of connectivity for EU laws
New EU laws can be very expensive for local authorities to implement. There is no financial compensation as there is for laws passed by the federal states. We want to change that: We want local authorities to receive cost compensation from the EU for the implementation of EU law.
Winning a seat in parliament
We want the European Parliament to meet in one place only in future. The regular relocation not only causes enormous costs, but also releases considerable amounts of CO2 as MEPs and their office materials are regularly transported back and forth between countries.
Europe as a meeting place
For us FREIE WÄHLER, Europe is a project of peace and cooperation between citizens. Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen a weakening of social cohesion in the EU and national egoisms are once again increasingly guiding our actions.
8
The EU, one of the greatest projects of international understanding of all time, is currently losing acceptance and significance. We want to actively counteract this by bringing people together in order to strengthen European awareness. We want to achieve this through a citizens' Europe that offers a wide range of opportunities for encounters and education on European issues.
Strengthening European educational exchange
The European Erasmus+ funding program for education, training, youth and sport is an effective instrument for intercultural education and European youth exchange. However, demand is higher than the available supply and the bureaucratic hurdles are too high. We therefore want to provide the program with better funding and simplify its structure. The Erasmus+ funding program is currently only aimed at a specific group of people. We are committed to extending it to all social and age groups in order to further promote European encounters.
Promoting European education
Unfortunately, the structures, working methods and mechanisms of the EU are still not as deeply rooted in people's consciousness as they need to be. We therefore want all political levels in Germany - from the cities and municipalities to the federal government - to devote more attention to imparting knowledge about our common European project. We are therefore also committed to intensifying European educational cooperation.
Expanding town twinning
Town twinning strengthens the European sense of community and promotes international understanding. They are invaluable for European cohesion. We are therefore committed to strengthening municipal twinning work. Town twinning should help to develop cooperation and exploit synergies.
Enabling cultural exchange across borders
We want to strengthen voluntary projects in the field of youth exchange and civic encounters, including within the framework of town twinning. We support cross-border voluntary work by civil society organizations. These include clubs, associations, trade unions, research institutions, educational institutions and church and charitable organizations.
Creating an EU volunteering marketplace
Without voluntary work, our society will not be able to survive in the long term. That is why we want to strengthen volunteering and all people who volunteer for an organization without remuneration or take on tasks that serve the common good. We believe it is necessary for these non-profit workers to benefit from attractive benefits, e.g. higher tax relief or free tickets for local public transport, from government agencies. We also advocate the introduction of an EU-wide online platform to improve the networking of volunteers. This platform serves the exchange and cross-border placement of volunteers within Europe and thus builds on the positive experiences with municipal volunteer exchanges. We need clear regulations in the context of cross-border placement so that volunteers are not overburdened and the offers respect basic values such as the European concept of humanity. We are convinced that "healthy" volunteering at a European level sustainably promotes cultural and human cooperation within the framework of the European idea.
9
Harmonizing sports funding in the EU
As part of the European Health Union, we want to expand and harmonize the promotion of sport in the member states across Europe. To this end, the national associations must be networked via the EU Health Policy Platform to develop and implement targeted measures. Our aim is to encourage as many Europeans as possible to adopt an active and healthy lifestyle in the long term through sport and competition.
Recognizing e-sports as a sport
We are convinced that politics at all levels, and especially at European level, must take social, scientific, cultural and sociological developments into account and create appropriate framework conditions. We therefore want to recognize e-sports activities, which are particularly popular with children and young people, as a sport and promote them accordingly.
Europe as a peace project
We FREIE WÄHLER want to give all European countries that respect our fundamental values and meet the relevant criteria the prospect of accession. A large, united Europe strengthens us economically and in terms of foreign policy. Therefore, every European country that is part of our system of values should have the option of participating in our European work of peace from the outset. Honest accession prospects have already proved to be a driving force for reform in the Central Eastern European countries following the dissolution of the Eastern bloc.
At the moment, the EU is not sufficiently set up to be described as sustainably receptive. The fact that a single country can block decisions in too many areas or that every small country always has to provide an EU Commissioner makes it difficult for the institutions to work. We must change this situation as quickly as possible in order to be able to offer credible reception prospects again in the short term. We therefore rely on further possibilities for majority decision- making in clearly defined policy areas. These current systemic problems in the EU must not be allowed to hold up accession processes.
Stop Turkey's accession to the EU
Particularly in light of the political developments in recent years, we firmly reject the admission of Erdogan's Turkey to the EU. We want to permanently end the accession negotiations in view of the development towards an authoritarian state. This development pains us because it does not strengthen Europe, but a united Europe is more important than sheer size. The aim must remain to offer Turkey - like other non-European countries with close ties to the EU - a privileged partnership based on the principle of close cooperation with separate decision- making.
Enabling enlargement of the Western Balkans
We want to continue negotiations with the countries of the Western Balkans. Influences from China and the Arab region in particular must be vehemently pushed back. In the medium term, the prospect of the countries of the Western Balkans joining the EU is undisputed, as is our unwavering determination to formally include this part of our continent in the European family. However, in view of the progress of negotiations to date and the ongoing consolidation of the Union, it will not be possible to admit them in the near future without further ado. We Free Democrats are committed to ensuring that the necessary conditions for the accession of the Western Balkan countries to the EU are created as quickly as possible.
10
Involving civil society in expansions from the outset
Further EU accessions must not be discussed behind closed doors. We therefore advocate the intensive involvement of all social interest groups in order to discuss future rounds of enlargement in an open and transparent manner. Before another country can join the EU, a referendum must be held in Germany.
Expansion of the EU neighborhood policy
We want to intensify the EU's neighborhood policy with the regions bordering Europe. In this way, we want to sustainably strengthen respect for human rights, the rule of law and the development of democracy and a market economy beyond our external borders and support them through incentive programs. We want to take the opportunity to support the EU's neighboring countries in their internal reforms towards more democracy. However, we also want to strengthen our economic and foreign policy position as Europe in these regions and make better use of it. Europe must pursue an active neighborhood policy in line with our European interests. The keywords here are training, migration and repatriation agreements, energy partnerships, raw material and production location agreements.
Europe must become safer: Uncontrolled migration, wars in the surrounding area, insecurity felt in everyday life as well as gang and organized crime are a burden on our personal lives. We Free Democrats want to change this by massively strengthening European security both internally and externally.
Border controls and barriers within Europe are a sign of chaos and weakness and must be avoided. Externally, however, Europe must regain sovereignty over its borders immediately. This is not a national task for the border states, but for the EU as a whole and must therefore be guaranteed and paid for by the EU.
Europe as a security guarantor
The EU security agency Europol must be further developed into a European police office with its own executive powers. The aim must be to make it capable of acting across member state borders. This applies in particular to serious crimes in cyberspace that are committed across borders, such as organized drug and arms trafficking, child pornography and cyber-attacks, as well as serious crimes of organized crime, insofar as these reveal transnational structures.
It must be prevented that criminal gangs, clans, smugglers, drug traffickers and cyber criminals can operate largely unhindered in Europe due to open borders, while law enforcement authorities must continue to stop at borders. Good coordination, a reduction in bureaucracy and the ability to act quickly must enable law enforcement authorities to act across borders and prosecute criminals and criminal organizations throughout Europe.
Deepening cooperation between the police and judiciary
Challenges such as organized crime and terrorism require more joint action in Europe. We welcome the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which, however
11
clearly defined responsibilities. We advocate better cooperation between the police and judicial authorities of the EU member states. This means further opening up European borders for the police and judiciary, without calling into question the principle of subsidiarity. However, what we cannot achieve in Germany between the federal states will not work in the EU either. Germany must therefore set a good example and introduce measurable reforms at all levels of police cooperation.
Strengthening European security agencies
We want to give the European security agencies Europol and Eurojust as well as the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) more far-reaching powers to act. The European Parliament and the national parliaments must be given more control rights and room for maneuver in home affairs and justice policy.
Promoting the exchange of information between judicial and law enforcement authorities We want to massively strengthen cooperation between judicial and law enforcement authorities within Europe. In particular, we are committed to strengthening the joint fight against terrorism within the framework of the
"European Counter Terrorism Center" and to focus more on cross-border organized crime. We call for more information sharing between member states and EU institutions, including the Parliament, to improve situational awareness and combat security threats. We also call for a strengthening of the Single Analysis and Analysis Mechanism (SIAC) and the Rapid Alert System (RAS).
Intensify cooperation with Interpol
Crime does not stop at our external European borders. We therefore also want to intensify international cooperation with law enforcement authorities within the framework of Interpol.
Training European police units
We also want to strengthen the joint cross-border training and further training of our police within the framework of CEPOL. This is a prerequisite for ensuring that cooperation between the security authorities functions smoothly in practice.
Digitizing investigative work
We need state-of-the-art technology in Europe to be able to identify criminals and threats quickly. That is why we are committed to modern equipment for the security authorities. In line with this, laws and regulations must also be adapted to improve the networking of security authorities and their data exchange while safeguarding the data protection rights of innocent bystanders. Existing or future IT infrastructures of the public sector as well as of companies and private individuals must be comprehensively defended in order to protect personal and intangible rights.
Fending off extremists
Extremist and terrorist violence must be combated in advance and prevented wherever possible. To this end, we want to strengthen prevention and deradicalization in the fight against extremism and terrorism across Europe and promote the development of joint strategies. We also consistently call for measures to combat disinformation and the influence of actors from third countries in a joint and coordinated manner.
12
Control security agencies
We want the European security agencies to be subject to parliamentary control. The European Parliament must take on this task.
Intensive examination of Schengen accession candidates
We make sure that new candidates for accession to the Schengen area meet all security-related criteria in a sustainable manner before they are admitted - such as the rule of law and a determined fight against corruption, organized crime and terrorism. For us, there are no compromises. Immediate sanction mechanisms must be in place in the event of subsequent non-compliance.
Better coordination of European civil protection
We want to ensure that Europe can respond better and more efficiently to disasters. Early warning, reporting and situation centers must be expanded. We are committed to ensuring that the member states maintain certain contingents for emergency situations - such as flood disasters, earthquakes or forest fires - that can be deployed quickly throughout Europe. This involves special equipment and devices, including personnel and emergency medical teams. Through intelligent division of labor, we can save taxpayers' money, reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and increase efficiency at the same time. Nevertheless, it must be ensured that the final decision on national capacities remains with the member states. It therefore makes sense to expand European capacity in addition.
Prevent the tightening of gun laws
We rely on the personal responsibility of citizens who legally own weapons. We have one of the strictest gun laws in the world in Germany and consider this to be sufficient. Further tightening through European legislation would be disproportionate. At the same time, however, more must be done to combat illegal gun ownership.
Europe as a border guard
Europe is far from prepared for refugee crises like the one in fall 2015. We want to change that. We continue to strive for a European solution to the migration issue. If we want to prevent a permanent return to barriers at our internal borders, we must work together to protect our external borders. This requires the establishment of a joint European border guard. FRONTEX needs a major update.
Strengthening European border protection
We want to massively strengthen European external border protection. FRONTEX should take over the coordination here and be massively expanded. The member states should no longer have to take the lead in external border protection, but only provide more support. We are pushing for a joint European border protection unit consisting of contingents provided by the member states. It must be able to monitor the entire external border of the EU in a meaningful way. In addition to sufficient personnel, it must also have the necessary modern equipment.
Reforming asylum and refugee policy
Asylum, refugee protection and subsidiary protection in the event of civil wars always mean temporary residence. For this, we need a reliable entry and exit system that ensures consistent
13
Refoulement at the EU's external border and asylum procedures outside Europe. It must be recognized that the Dublin Agreement has failed. We reject the forced redistribution of asylum seekers to all EU member states. The classification of countries of origin into safe and unsafe third countries must be carried out jointly. Asylum procedures should primarily be carried out at the EU's external borders within days in EU institutions. To this end, applicants must be accommodated in decent housing near the EU's external borders. The entire financing and implementation must be carried out by the EU. Maximum consideration must be given to the interests of the inhabitants of the border areas.
Separate asylum and immigration policy
We want a clear separation of immigration and asylum. Irrespective of asylum procedures, the EU must pursue an independent immigration policy. The nation states must be solely responsible for its implementation. The de facto stay at an EU external border due to irregular migration must not be a preferential criterion for regular migration. On the contrary, unsuccessful, irregular migration must be a reason for exclusion from regular migration. Targeted immigration migration must be based on national and European interests. The ability to integrate is also a decisive criterion in cultural terms. The unrestricted free movement of persons and freedom of establishment in the EU should only apply to immigrants after naturalization and a stay of at least 7 years in the receiving country without criminal record. To this end, citizenship law must be harmonized between the members of the European Union. We want to expand the European Blue Card model for qualified workers.
Conclude repatriation agreements with countries of origin of refugees
We want the EU to promote the conclusion of so-called EU readmission agreements in order to make individual national readmission agreements superfluous. In return, the countries of origin of refugees should be given a privileged role in European development cooperation. Payments for behaviour that complies with international law in the countries of origin should only be considered as an exception and care should be taken to ensure that EU funds do not trickle away there, but flow to reliable aid organizations on the ground. Clear sanctions should be imposed on non-cooperative countries. If necessary, all means permitted under international law should be exhausted.
Regaining control over sea rescue
Europe must ensure that thousands of people do not drown in the Mediterranean every year. To this end, it must be ensured that sea boarding is prevented, that, if necessary, immediate repatriation is carried out at sea by the EU's external border guards and that sanctions are imposed on neighboring states that do not cooperate. Institutionalized civil sea rescue must be integrated into the command structures of the EU's external border guard or prevented. Sovereign tasks must be carried out by sovereign authorities.
Enforce readmission agreements with Maghreb states
We are pursuing the goal of returning migrants intercepted in the Mediterranean to the nearby North African coast. Enabling illegal departures or onward journeys must have noticeable consequences for those countries that do not prevent this and must not lead to the EU paying out billions. The possibility of repatriation under international law, even against the will of the country concerned, must be examined.
14
Fighting traffickers through European asylum centers in Africa
We want to create legal entry routes into the EU for people who we need in Europe and who want to integrate here. Asylum applications must be able to be made and examined before crossing into Europe. Illegal immigration and the inhumane business model of people smugglers must be stopped. Europe should support the countries of origin in their border protection activities in a spirit of partnership.
Europe as a global player
We FREIE WÄHLER want to take a much more European approach to the foreign policy challenges of the 21st century. We want Germany and Europe to become involved in global politics as reliable partners and honest brokers. With a peaceful, predictable and value-based European foreign policy, we want to play a responsible role in shaping coexistence on our planet. Securing peace is our most important goal. Diplomacy must always take priority in conflicts.
Our compass must be our commitment to the right of peoples to self-determination and the guarantee of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It is important for us to counteract climate change internationally, to fight hunger in the world, to ensure resource security and, in particular, energy supply. We must also guarantee access to the raw materials that Europe needs at world market prices. However, we do not want to go it alone in foreign policy, but always in close coordination with our allies in democratic constitutional states.
Living a foreign policy based on values
As the EU, we want to stand up for democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights worldwide. States that do not make serious efforts in this regard must be sanctioned with graduated economic measures. At the same time, however, an approach must always be found to interact with authoritarian regimes and not completely cut off channels of communication. Small EU member states in particular should take on dedicated tasks and roles from the EU.
Presenting a united front internationally
We are committed to greater European unity in international politics and in international organizations. We therefore support the strengthening of the European External Action Service (EEAS) in order to coordinate the 27 different foreign policies of the EU member states as effectively as possible. As part of our aim to reduce the number of EU Commissioners, all areas of action with foreign policy responsibilities should be brought together under one person. In particular, enlargement, neighborhood and development cooperation policies should be placed under the umbrella of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.
Achieving more together in foreign policy
We clearly reject protectionism, isolationism and nationalism. In terms of foreign policy, we need more rather than less dialog and cooperation. Movements within the UN or the OSCE that oppose Western values must be closely monitored and consistently prevented.
15
Strengthening Europe as a force for peace
We want politics and diplomacy to take precedence over military intervention, but we do not rule it out. We have learned from Srebrenica, Sarajevo and Rwanda, among others, and want a defensive human rights policy. We are committed to upholding human rights and religious freedom in the world.
Maintaining the Franco-German partnership
Whenever Germany and France have acted in close alliance and unity, the crises in Europe have been overcome. This is why we want to once again attach the greatest importance to the Franco-German tandem in European policy and strive for close coordination of common goals with our French friends. This must be institutionalized and established on a permanent basis and go far beyond visits and friendship meetings. Mutual support, including in dealing with points of domestic political conflict, must not be excluded.
Continuing the German-Polish partnership
In view of the difficult shared history and historical responsibility, we want to further strengthen the partnership between Germany and Poland. It is the foundation of our joint reconciliation. In particular, we want to expand the dialog between our civil societies. Possible prejudices or grievances, such as in the areas of the rule of law, women's rights and minorities, must be clearly addressed. The focus must be on joint solutions.
Maintaining partnership relations with the United Kingdom
The withdrawal of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the EU is painful. An economic power comparable to the twenty smallest economies among the EU member states has been lost to our single market. We must respect the people's decision and therefore look for new ways to reconcile our partnership relations at a high level. We want this to happen fairly and without special concessions to the United Kingdom. In the long term, the aim must be to rejoin the EU.
Expanding transatlantic relations
We want to maintain and expand our good partnership relations with North American countries, particularly the USA, on an equal footing. We will work to ensure that this relationship is based more strongly on mutual respect. Even greater cooperation is particularly important when it comes to issues that affect Europe in its immediate environment - as has been the case since the Russian attack on Ukraine.
Stabilizing crisis regions
Regime changes in recent years have plunged many countries into chaos. Europe must act as a mediator and advisor here with a reliable foreign policy. We are pursuing the stabilization of the affected areas. To this end, we want to use the existing European contacts in the civil societies of the affected countries to support them on the path to a free order. We cannot and do not want to impose our values such as democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights from above; they must be lived from below.
Don't let Russia win
The Putin-Russian war of aggression against Ukraine must not and will not succeed. Ukraine alone determines the conditions for peace. The sanctions against Russia must be implemented and regularly evaluated. Evasion of sanctions must be consistently punished.
16
become a reality. We advocate that the EU promote political and social change in Russia much more intensively and intelligently. Russia is culturally and geographically part of Europe and its people must be given a perspective based on our values in the medium term. This, combined with Ukraine's accelerated accession to NATO and the prospect of EU membership, must be a sign to the Russians that their development must be oriented towards the West in their own interests and must proceed without Putin. To this end, the dialog with civil society in Russia in particular must not be allowed to break down, despite the current major differences. Regular, organized exchange is important to us because it is the only way to achieve progress. At the same time, we must not allow diplomatic channels to break down so that we are not dependent on mediation by third countries. In particular, non-G7 EU countries should take on this foreign policy task.
Further developing relations with Ukraine
We support Ukraine in restoring its full territorial integrity. We are committed to ensuring that Europe supports the country in strengthening its internal stability and its social development on the basis of our fundamental European values. It goes without saying that the fight against corruption in particular is essential for deepening cooperation. Financial support is linked to reform efforts. Stronger ties with Europe must be promoted at all levels - including through increased exchange at the level of the civilian population and administrative structures.
Acting confidently towards China
A new China strategy is needed that significantly reduces dependence on China, especially in the economy. The EU must put itself back in a position to criticize the Chinese government without having to fear disproportionate economic losses. The implementation of a clearly perceptible diversification of supply chains and risk minimization ("derisking") must be started immediately.
Supporting independent Taiwan
A clear commitment to an independent Taiwan is required in terms of democracy and international law, but also for reasons of supply chain control. Diplomatic relations must be established and expanded. The people of Taiwan must be allowed to decide their own future in freedom. Potential Chinese encroachments on Taiwan are unacceptable and must have consequences.
Intensify global gateway initiative
China is striving to expand its influence worldwide through economic initiatives. The Global Gateway Initiative must be intensified as a counter-model to the Belt and Road Initiative, and the EU must become an attractive alternative to Chinese investors.
Clearly naming Chinese human rights violations
Offers should be made to the Chinese democracy movement; humanitarian admission programs for those persecuted by the Chinese regime (e.g. from Hong Kong) should be intensified for reasons of principle and in order to gain better access to insider know-how. Strengthened sanctions against those responsible for human rights violations (Magnitsky Act) should be implemented. Persecution, "re-education" and the cultural genocide of the Uyghurs must be identified by the EU Parliament and products from Uyghur forced labor must be banned from the EU domestic market.
17
Sanction the Iranian regime
The Iranian regime is not a reliable partner for the international community. A nuclear-free Iran must be ensured by all means. The Iranian regime is spreading its expansionist policies throughout the entire Middle East region and is responsible for wars and terror with hundreds of thousands of victims. The EU must react to this with consistency and severity and ensure that sanctions also noticeably weaken the regime.
Support Israel
We see the existence and security of Israel as the central mission of our policy. We stand unwaveringly by Israel's side, even in difficult times. Germany has a special historical responsibility towards the State of Israel. Israel's existence and security must be permanently guaranteed. Israel deserves our support at all levels. Likewise, the people in Gaza and the West Bank must be given a lasting situation worth living in. The neighboring Arab countries must be held accountable. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the terror planned by Hamas against the Israeli civilian population with direct support from Iran. Anyone who abducts people to use them as human shields against the army, or even murders them, must never again assume a political role in the Middle East. Currently, financial support for the Palestinian territories must be cut off completely unless it can be ensured that Hamas does not benefit from it directly or indirectly. The terror financier Iran must also be shown clear limits.
Deepening cooperation with regional alliances
We want to intensify cooperation with the African Union and the Arab League. We need joint strategies and joint action against the threat to freedom posed by international terrorism and in dealing with unstable countries with a view to our own security.
Getting the Africa strategy off the ground
We want to deepen cooperation with our southern neighboring continent through a joint strategy. In doing so, we want to help implement the African Union's Agenda 2063 in order to contribute to the socio-economic transformation of the African continent. However, we also want to provide direct support on the ground so that the local populations can develop sustainable and stable structures. We must counteract the influence exerted by Chinese and Russian actors, for example through economic development programs and our own information campaigns that "promote" the EU in order to refute contrary representations.
Securing access to raw materials
Based on the European raw materials strategy, we want to organize European access to rare earths, industrial minerals and fossil raw materials for energy production in partnership with the corresponding countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. For Europe, this is primarily about minimizing risk and diversifying supply chains and becoming less dependent on the Chinese market in particular. However, the overriding goal must be to reuse raw materials in the cycle and promote alternatives to fossil fuels. To this end, research and development of recycling methods must be strengthened. Protected areas in the Arctic and Antarctic must be preserved and their inviolability ensured.
18
Europe as a development aid worker
Everyone has a right to their homeland and must be given the opportunity to live there safely and peacefully in full self-determination. However, with around 100 million people currently on the run, this goal is becoming increasingly distant. The causes of displacement are manifold and by no means limited to armed conflicts. We are therefore concerned with ensuring sustainable, prosperous and democratic development based on the rule of law, increased climate protection, good governance and securing livelihoods in all regions of the world.
For us FREIE WÄHLER, a properly implemented sustainable development policy would be a good contribution to a peaceful and secure world. It removes the breeding ground for the radicalization of people and eliminates the reasons for flight. It prevents extremism, terrorism and the desperate search of many people for better living conditions. The development policy to date has not been convincing. In particular, the practice of European taxpayers' money flowing to strategic rivals of the EU - such as the BRICS states - and corrupt regimes must end. As a consequence, the EU's current development policy should be completely replaced by programs in economic and educational cooperation with other countries. Also with the aim of strengthening value- and rights-based education in the target countries.
Living up to our responsibility as donor countries
UN aid organizations such as the UNHCR suffer from chronic underfunding. Promised payments are regularly delayed. The precarious situations in many refugee camps are a reason for many of the people accommodated there to flee to Europe. We are therefore in favor of continuous funding from the EU. The aim must be more planning security through a separate budget at United Nations level. In addition to the immediate provision of food, medicine, shelter and clothing, humanitarian aid on the ground must also include intensive educational opportunities. Only in this way can young people in particular be offered long-term prospects of either returning to their home country or being given a realistic chance of legal immigration and a promising start in another country.
Invest 0.7 percent of our economic output
We will work to ensure that Germany and the other EU member states permanently adhere to the internationally agreed target of allocating 0.7% of our gross domestic product to development aid. These funds are an important investment in our security because they prevent refugees from fleeing to Europe and radicalization. We are striving to increase funding for development cooperation at EU level. Together, Europe has a responsibility to take decisive action to combat the causes of flight.
Coordinating development policy
For historical reasons, the individual EU member states have special relationships with certain regions of the world. In European development policy, we want to ensure that the member states and their civil societies use these links to focus their development policy activities on these regions. Together with better coordination of development policy at EU level, we want to achieve meaningful synergies and a more efficient use of funds through this division of labor.
19
Europe as a defense community
The rapidly changing global security situation, particularly with regard to the Russian war of aggression, expansionist tendencies of the Chinese leadership and religiously motivated regional wars, especially in Islamic states, present Europe with new challenges. Stronger relations with all democratic states in the world are essential in parallel to the focus on transatlantic relations.
We FREIE WÄHLER are committed to making the EU more independent in terms of security policy in order to live up to its increasing international responsibility. It must become an independent, strong and reliable partner of peaceful states.
We need a common European security and defense policy that is willing and able to formulate its own interests and assert them when necessary. We advocate a close alliance with our European neighbors in order to establish an independent defense alliance with its own army. A united Europe can significantly strengthen our interests and our fundamental values within NATO. However, we are striving for close European cooperation in the field of defense, which should not duplicate the NATO structure, but rather complement it. In this context, we welcome the NATO membership of Sweden and Finland. This will strengthen the role of the EU in NATO. A strong Europe in NATO can meet the USA on an equal footing and must - also in line with the broad will of the American people - relieve the USA of some of its alliance tasks.
Advancing "Permanent Structured Cooperation"
A good six years after the signing of the PESCO agreement on "Permanent Structured Cooperation" and the course set by most EU member states for a common European defense in 2017, progress must be assessed. This initiative urgently needs to be filled with life and expanded quickly. To this end, we want to create a formal body of European defense ministers at European level and install a committee on defense issues in the European Parliament.
Creating a European army
We want to build a European army to complement the national armies. This army should primarily perform common tasks outside the EU territory and leverage synergies internally. A European army should be placed under the full control of the European Parliament; it must approve future joint operations and missions of European armed forces. In addition, a European Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces with responsibilities comparable to those of the German Armed Forces Commissioner must take up his work.
Establishing the operational capability of the Bundeswehr
The operational capability of the Bundeswehr must be ensured. We vehemently stand by our membership in NATO and demand a noticeable increase in Germany's contribution, including permanent funding for the Bundeswehr of well over 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). This demand also applies to all other EU states. We want every participating EU member state to make a contribution to the common defense commensurate with its size. The target of at least 2 percent of GDP must be consistently implemented for this purpose. Failure to meet the target will result in financial sanctions.
20
of the EU against the member state in question up to 2 percent of GDP. For Germany, the 2% target must be secured in each individual year, regardless of the special fund.
Developing training units together
We want to intensify the joint basic, advanced and further training of multinational units in Europe. The harmonization of qualifications and their mutual recognition is a basic prerequisite for joint operations. As a strong alliance partner, we believe Germany has a duty to assume a leading role in the training of multinational command and control forces. This will require even more political will to act in the future.
Organize joint armament projects
Armaments projects are becoming significantly more complex and cost-intensive, making it increasingly difficult for individual states within the EU to carry them alone. Joint armaments projects at European level enable significant savings through higher quantities and lower overhead costs. The aim must be to reduce the number of different weapon systems, also in order to facilitate military coordination and cooperation. Shared systems also ensure this necessary interoperability and significantly reduce the logistical effort involved in joint operations. We therefore want to intensify "Permanent Structured Cooperation" as quickly as possible and transfer armaments projects to the European level. Since the war in Ukraine, there has been a clearly increased willingness to do this in the EU. One example of this is the ASAP regulations, which are intended to strengthen the European arms industry. These must be further strengthened, intensified and, above all, accelerated. Joint research and development in the field of armaments must be promoted, also in order to strengthen the EU as a location and thus make it more militarily independent in the event of a crisis.
Introducing joint procurement
The Bundeswehr's current procurement system is not suitable for meeting quantitative and qualitative armaments requirements in a timely manner. For decades, attempts have been made to solve the problem with cosmetic improvements. A considerably larger share of joint procurement is necessary in order to save costs and optimize processes. We therefore want to shift procurement to the European level. This can save considerable costs and optimize processes. We support the goal at EU level (see EDIRPA regulation) to promote joint procurement.
Installing European cyber defense
The improvement of the instruments for countering hybrid threats to the EU, particularly with regard to activities in connection with cyber attacks and information manipulation, must be regularly reviewed. Cyber attacks must be combated decisively in the military, government and private sector. That is why we want to establish a joint European Union cyber defense center. In particular, it should guarantee the security of our critical infrastructures. This includes the supply of electricity and drinking water, which are essential for the state community and for maintaining public order, healthcare and the economic or social well-being of the population. It should work closely with the NATO Cyber Defense Center in Tallinn. The EU must be given the necessary competencies for this.
21
Protecting sea and trade routes
Our common European foreign trade depends on safe sea and trade routes. Piracy and interstate conflicts pose a problem in this respect. The corona pandemic in particular demonstrated the fragility of international trade routes and our dependence on globally supplied products. We are therefore committed to greater security on sea and trade routes. To this end, the EU and NATO must form international alliances with third countries. A threat to international waters, such as that posed by China in the South China Sea, must be clearly countered.
Reliable framework conditions create quality of life. In order to be able to guarantee the most important basic needs for the people in our country - from food security to affordable energy and healthcare close to home at the highest level to the preservation of social peace - we rely on the common strength of Europe. To this end, we Free Democrats want to agree on common rules in all member states that will improve the lives of local citizens and thus create a home worth living in for all people in Europe in the long term.
We are committed to ensuring that dependencies on countries outside the EU for key goods such as food and medical products are reduced and that these global dependencies are not built up any further. If goods are imported into the EU, they must either have been produced to demonstrably comparable process standards or the corresponding cost advantage should be offset by import duties.
Our domestic agriculture and small and medium-sized enterprises must have fair competitive opportunities. People in rural areas in particular must not be left behind so that everyone in their home region can look positively to the future, both professionally and privately. Rural areas and their cultural landscape must be strengthened.
Europe as an agricultural area
Affordable and high-quality food is the basis for a healthy, satisfied and high-performing society. The main task of our agriculture is to provide the population with a secure supply of high-quality food. Agriculture must be enabled to produce this food. This includes the professional approval of fertilizers and pesticides.
Laws affecting this area must be subject to particularly sensitive impact assessments. In addition to food production, farmers also perform valuable economic, social and environmental tasks for rural areas and our homeland. When it comes to competition for land for infrastructure, residential development, the establishment of industry or the further expansion of renewable energies, agricultural land must be regarded as an equal "protected good for feeding humans and animals" alongside other protected goods.
A unified Europe needs a unified legal basis. If the European agricultural economy is to be preserved, it needs protection against dumping standards at the EU's external borders through customs duties. These could replace the current single farm payments. In the interests of a sustainable
22
In a circular economy, nutrients from human excrement must not be incinerated, but should be used efficiently alongside farm manure and imported mineral fertilizers.
We strictly reject legally prescribed fertilization below the necessary plant requirements. Setting aside valuable arable land without replacement does not benefit nature, but instead promotes hunger in the world. Plant protection products that have been tested and approved by the EU authorities must also be usable in Germany. A German special path is also detrimental to security of supply and product quality.
Ensuring harmony between ecology, economy and social issues
For us, sustainability means a balanced triad of ecology, economy and social balance for the farming operations. In order to be ecologically successful, circular economy, resource conservation and efficiency are just as necessary as minimizing environmental impacts. The most important goal for our population is to ensure food security even in times of crisis. In addition to food security, the domestic agricultural sector can also contribute to the supply of renewable energies and renewable raw materials. We want to achieve these goals by supporting innovations in technology, breeding and cultivation methods in a forward-looking way. In order to ensure food security for the population in the long term, European farmers must be protected from imports from third countries, including through import tariffs if necessary.
Valuing agriculture's contribution to CO reduction2
We recognize the enormous upfront efforts of agriculture in saving carbon dioxide. We therefore reject the unfair allocation of CO2 emissions between economic sectors. This is the only way to ensure food security, food quality and health now and in times of crisis.
Maintaining the security of supply and diversity of companies
First and foremost, farmers should ensure food security with healthy, high-quality food. In addition to this main task, domestic agriculture also fulfills a number of other existential services for our community. Without a diverse agricultural sector, the cultural landscapes that have been created over generations and that make our homeland so liveable cannot be preserved. These special social services, especially in structurally disadvantaged areas, must be adequately rewarded by the EU in the future. The same applies to the demand for services that society also places on farms. It is by no means sufficient to continue to merely reimburse part of the additional costs incurred. There is no other way to maintain the diversity of agriculture in Europe. We call for the first pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to be maintained and expanded in order to compensate for existing competitive disadvantages compared to imported goods with lower standards. Furthermore, extensive environmental system services already provided under the second pillar must be adequately remunerated. In the case of payments from the second pillar, we call for the numerous highly bureaucratic measures to be replaced by a few, technically sensible measures in order to actually achieve measurable improvements for agricultural diversity.
Streamlining European agricultural law
European agricultural policy has developed into an ineffective bureaucratic monster. The over- regulation does not create any advantage, but instead leads to an increasingly rapid demise of farms in Europe and Germany. There are many things that well-trained farmers could do in a much more sustainable and meaningful way for nature, the environment, biodiversity, CO2 reduction and the environment.
23
food safety with high quality at affordable prices than blanket EU regulations can. A number of regulations and directives should be scrapped without replacement, as they do not do justice to regional circumstances. We call for the introduction of quality management with impact assessment for European agricultural policy.
Avoid competitive disadvantages compared to third countries
Common EU agricultural policy rules are needed to prevent Germany from imposing ever higher process standards on itself than those prescribed by EU regulations. The resulting loss of competitiveness leads to the migration of German production abroad. Another important element will be origin labeling for both primary products and the main components of processed products.
Strengthen producers vis-à-vis the food retail trade
We are committed to creating new framework conditions for cooperation between agriculture and retail that establish a balance between the two partners. In Germany, 84 percent of the food retail trade (LEH) is dominated by four groups. This oligopoly abuses its market power over agricultural producers, producer groups, dairies and butchers in order to push purchase prices below the actual production costs and generate higher consumer prices. Through long-term trading partnerships with the local food industry, food retailers should ensure security of supply and regionality of food. Unfair trading practices, such as payment terms after the goods have been sold, shelf rents or the forced return of unsold fresh produce, must be prevented throughout the EU.
Putting a stop to the regulatory frenzy
The EU is overburdening farmers and smaller businesses in the food industry with bureaucratic requirements. These businesses need their valuable working time to ensure the supply of food to the population. Administrative tasks must be reduced. Controls under national and European law that affect the same area must be merged and controls must be reduced to a healthy, comprehensible level overall.
Advancing digitalization in rural areas
To enable digitalization in agriculture, we are calling for sufficient network coverage with 5G or at least LTE mobile communications on every patch of agricultural land in Europe. The same applies to the connection to a fiber optic network literally "to the last milk churn". In the area of "smart farming", both in the field and in the barn, it must be ensured that the data always remains the property of the users and that they retain control over their own data at all times. Correction signals for satellite navigation (RTK) must be made available to farmers free of charge. In the field of sensor technology, control technology and software, compatible interfaces and standards must be ensured across all providers. We want to promote user-related research and development.
Introducing clear indications of origin
We are in favor of a future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in which regional geographical origin is mandatory. We want to introduce this mandatory labeling both for products and for value-determining ingredients in processed foods. In the case of animal products, the countries of birth, rearing, fattening, slaughter and processing must be identified.
24
work must be clearly marked. For Germany, for example, this would be five times "D". The country of production is also mandatory for plant-based products such as fruit, vegetables, cereals and oils. Regional crafts and direct marketers should be exempt from the strict declaration requirements. Regional labels should also be used. In this way, we want to highlight the added value of our multifaceted European agriculture.
Appreciating food
The greatest food waste occurs in the field due to pests, fungi or EU standards. It is these standards that prevent some fruit and vegetables from reaching the supermarket shelves in the first place. Another reason is the minimum shelf life dates, which lead to food that is still fit for consumption being disposed of prematurely. We are calling for effective and proven active ingredients to be tested and approved so that as little food as possible spoils in the field and in storage. Shelf life information should be given a recommendatory character. An addition such as: "This food is often good for longer!" could be used.
Securing the livelihoods of cutter fishermen
Despite the generally improved state of fish stocks in the North Sea and Atlantic, self-sufficiency in fish within the EU has steadily declined over the last decade. Currently, only 30 percent of the fish consumed in the EU is caught there. The EU must return to a model in which the production of and self-sufficiency in primary foodstuffs are genuine basic principles. The so-called "EU Action Plan" with its planned fishing bans in all marine protected areas endangers the existence of fishermen.
Further develop aquatic species and habitats
In view of the critical eel stock situation, measures should be taken with reference to the European Eel Regulation to increase silver eel escapement and allow the sustainable use of eel. To this end, it is necessary in most river basins to implement stocking measures to support the population and compensate for the current recruitment deficit. At the same time, measures must be taken to reduce mortality caused by hydropower plants and humans. However, we expressly warn against blanket stocking bans or year-round closed seasons for the whole of Germany. In view of the many reasons for the decline in the population, a single regulation of the fishing industry would not do justice to the protection of the eel and would possibly also have strong negative effects on the overall population. Furthermore, the specific conditions in the respective river basin do not allow for "off-the-peg" measures. The further development of eel stock management should take place in dialog with the fishermen concerned.
Protecting the traditional fishing industry
In addition to river fishing, pond farming also makes an important contribution to securing livelihoods and preserving our cultural landscape. We call for the active management of natural predators such as otters and cormorants, which have protected status. We therefore advocate an adaptation of the Habitats Directive at European level in order to expand the possibilities for sensible and operationally necessary removals.
Reducing wolf populations
We defend the ecological and cultural-historical contribution that pasture farming makes to our country. Due to the unchecked spread of the wolf population in Europe, not least
25
Due to a long outdated European Flora-Fauna-Habitat Directive, grazing is severely endangered. Wolves and bears are apex predators without natural enemies. The good conservation status of wolves is endangered neither in Europe nor in the world. They should therefore be removed from Annex 4 of the Habitats Directive. Regulation of wolf populations is the responsibility of the member states, which are called upon to set up appropriate active hunting of wolves. Wolves must be subject to regulated hunting, with a closed season during the rearing of pups. Wolves must be hunted during the rest of the year. They pose a considerable threat to livestock grazing, coastal protection, mountain pasture farming and diversity in the cultivated landscape.
Compensating for wolf kills
Any wolf attack on livestock and pets must be compensated by EU funds at the breeding value or market value over and above the fair market value. There must be no maximum limit (e.g. de minimis). The EU directive on the protection of livestock from predators explicitly excludes wolves. As long as the EU does not approve the regulated hunting of large carnivores, it must bear the costs of the otherwise unnecessary, wolf-repellent basic protective fencing and the damage caused by the breeding value. As long as an attack cannot be clearly attributed to a wolf, the burden of proof must be reversed. This means that the burden of proof lies with the authorities. We demand an end to the monopoly of the private Senckenberg Institute on wildlife monitoring and DNA analysis. All wildlife data paid for with public funds must be entered into an EU database and must be publicly accessible free of charge at all times.
Revise the Green Deal
The Green Deal is not climate-neutral and technology-neutral, but counterproductive in terms of CO2 savings. Any resulting reduction in agricultural production leads to increased land requirements elsewhere, more emissions and less favorable environmental effects. Agricultural land, which is becoming increasingly scarce, must be used more intensively, which is why all Green Deal requirements that lead to a reduction in harvest volumes are out of the question.
Expand "farm to fork" strategy ("from farm to fork")
We reject all EU regulations that lead to production being relocated to non-European countries. A reduction in plant protection products is in everyone's interest, but a blanket quantity target, as in the "Sustainable Use Regulation - SUR", is against common sense. We therefore call for the promotion of biological-technical research in order to achieve the reduction of plant protection products without reducing or jeopardizing the harvest volume. The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) should only apply to industrial operations and must not be applied to livestock farming. The Nature Restoration Act (NRL) must not lead to a reduction in yields. A blanket restriction of appropriate production leads to more hunger in the world. We are aware of our overall responsibility towards the constantly growing world population and therefore call for a sustainable increase in production on existing agricultural land.
26
Europe as an environmental and climate protector
We FREIE WÄHLER are committed to the protection of natural resources in line with the sustainability goals of the United Nations in Europe and the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement. This includes the long-term and responsible use of natural resources without damaging the environment or the needs of future generations.
The preservation and promotion of biodiversity and the protection of natural ecosystems include the promotion of human rights, justice and the participation of all people, as well as a fair and efficient economic system that promotes prosperity and innovation without neglecting the environment or social aspects.
Making EU emissions trading socially responsible
We want the EU emissions trading instrument to be designed in a socially responsible way without jeopardizing prosperity. Some of the revenue from emissions trading should be returned to citizens, for example in the form of a climate bonus or a reduction in other taxes or levies. Emissions trading should also promote measures for structural change, for example with a fund for phasing out coal or an innovation fund for climate-friendly technologies. Revenue from emissions trading should also be used for public investment in the energy-efficient refurbishment of buildings or the expansion of local public transport. We therefore firmly reject the extension of EU emissions trading to buildings and transport, which has already been decided, and call for this decision to be withdrawn. It is an attempt to make electricity-powered heat pumps and e-cars mandatory for private households without direct bans and regulations via massive cost increases. For millions of households, these burdens are almost impossible to shoulder. We reject all attempts by the state - whether at EU or federal level - to dictate to citizens how they should heat their houses and apartments with ever new requirements, regulations and levies. We call for a moratorium on new laws that impose new requirements or costs for heating and mobility.
Advancing the European energy transition
We want to shape the energy transition in Germany and Europe as a socially responsible project that does not jeopardize prosperity. Security of supply, economic efficiency, affordability, technological openness and environmentally friendly solutions should be the cornerstones of a sustainable energy transition. Wherever possible, electricity should be produced where it is consumed. We are committed to ensuring that citizens share in the profits. This keeps the added value local. An efficient power grid is also needed.
Secure energy supply
We are in favor of international cooperation on energy issues. We want to support the performance and competitiveness of German companies in the energy transition at an international level. Policymakers in Germany and Europe need a more open approach to technology. A secure and cost-effective energy supply is a peace-building project, an ethical imperative and an economic and ecological necessity. Germany should not go it alone at the expense of its European partners and against their declared will. The priority must be to ensure that the base load can be secured as soon as possible in a climate-neutral manner, without CO2 emissions and nuclear waste. In addition to the environmentally friendly expansion of renewable energy generation, we want to further expand biomass-based energy supply systems. Base load-capable power plants as well as research, development and application in the field of hydrogen
27
and the further scientific development of nuclear power and nuclear fusion options represent indispensable potential for a climate-neutral energy supply. This not only secures almost inexhaustible energy sources, but also pioneering industries.
Expanding European hydrogen cooperation
We want to create a uniform European hydrogen infrastructure. Large quantities of hydrogen are needed to make a significant contribution to the environmentally and climate-friendly transformation of industrial production and mobility. With the help of hydrogen partnerships, we want to exploit the potential for our domestic industry. In addition to production and distribution, the partnerships must also focus on application technologies. In the Germany-France hydrogen axis in particular, we want to create an "Airbus for hydrogen".
Expanding the protection of the North Sea and Baltic Sea
We are committed to effective fisheries regulations at European level. We also want better promotion and development of sustainable fishing techniques and methods. Greater efforts must be made to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks and avoid overfishing. We are calling for the problem of munitions waste in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, which has been known for decades, to be resolved. These contaminated sites pose a major threat to shipping, people and the ecosystem. We call for the systematic recording and mapping of the seabed, safe salvage and proper disposal using environmentally friendly methods, as well as effective monitoring and management strategies for remaining contaminated sites. We call for more international cooperation on issues affecting our seas, as the seas are a common European asset.
Organizing the expansion of offshore wind farms
We want to drive forward the expansion of offshore wind power in step with the necessary grid expansion in Europe.
Maintaining clean European waters
Water bodies are an essential part of our livelihood. Their quality should therefore be ensured at the highest level. We are committed to making the fourth purification stage in wastewater treatment plants the standard throughout Europe. It can be used to filter out antibiotic residues, hormones and other bioactive substances as well as microplastic residues. The use and application of organic and inorganic fertilizers on agricultural land is important for food security. It should be done in a way that is gentle on groundwater, but efficient and plant-friendly. We know that the nitrate content in the leachate directly in the topsoil must be higher than 50 milligrams, otherwise plant cultivation is not possible.
Guarantee drinking water supply
Increasing water demand and contamination from old, dilapidated and leaking drinking water, wastewater and mixed water pipes pose major challenges. We are calling for sustainable water management that secures the water supply throughout Europe. Sustainable technologies and concepts to increase water availability should be developed. We support the development of a process that extracts drinking water from the sea and brings it to dry regions with the help of long-distance pipelines.
28
Implement climate adaptation measures
In Europe, droughts, dry periods and heavy rainfall events will have to be expected more frequently in the future. Efficient use of drinking water will be just as urgently required as additional water storage capacities. There is also a need to press ahead with the construction of rainwater retention systems. The expansion of settlements in floodplains and areas with a high water hazard must be avoided. Preventive measures such as the avoidance of greenhouse gases have top priority.
Promoting the circular economy
We advocate sustainable waste management to protect the environment and people's health. The entire use cycle of waste and its impact on people and the environment must be the focus in future. Waste prevention should be the primary goal. The circular economy in the EU should be promoted more strongly so that, among other things, raw materials can be recovered from waste. Thermal waste treatment should be further developed so that the energy generated from it can be provided in a climate-neutral way. Waste transportation and waste trade in Europe should be more strictly controlled and regulated. The illegal shipment of waste into and out of Europe should be more strictly sanctioned.
Reduce plastic waste
We are committed to significantly reducing the amount of plastic waste and improving the opportunities for complete material recycling. In doing so, we are not only focusing on the cleaning performance of wastewater treatment plants (end-of-pipe), but also on reducing the discharge of these pollutants through research and development in production and household appliances. While end-of-pipe technologies reduce environmental pollution through downstream measures without changing the production process itself, begin-of-pipe measures refer to strategies that prevent the creation of environmental pollution through the correct selection of resources or energy.
Balancing the use of water bodies
In view of the diverse demands on water bodies, a fair balance should be struck between the sometimes conflicting demands for use, based primarily on cooperation and not on regulatory law. Water available close to the surface primarily supplies plant roots with water and nutrients. Drinking water for humans, industry and commerce has different requirements in terms of quantity and quality. Drinking water extraction areas should be reduced to the necessary minimum. Conflicting objectives are greatest in the case of surface waters due to the diverse demands for their use. They are habitats for diverse flora and fauna with different requirements in terms of permeability, nutrient and food content. They also fulfill important functions for local recreation, tourism and as water reservoirs. As waterways, they serve as navigable rivers and canals for the resource-saving transportation of bulk goods and containers and are indispensable for an environmentally friendly transport and traffic system due to their climate- friendly effect. The EU Water Framework Directive must therefore be adapted to better meet the various objectives.
Preserving the environment and nature for future generations
We stand for the preservation of native species in the respective regions of Europe. This includes measures to preserve and create new natural habitats such as forests, moors, fields, meadows and bodies of water, e.g. by unsealing or revitalizing abandoned commercial and industrial sites. These habitats provide important ecosystem services.
29
services such as the storage of carbon, the regulation of the water balance and the provision of food and raw materials. Citizens must be better informed about the relevant man-made causes and consequences of biodiversity loss in Europe and be shown ways in which they can contribute to the protection of nature on their own responsibility. International cooperation and the political will to preserve biodiversity must be strengthened in Europe. However, the rights and interests of the local population must be taken into account.
Combating invasive fauna and flora
More emphasis must be placed on the preservation, maintenance and protection of typical regional flora and fauna. More measures must be taken and promoted to reduce and combat locally invasive species that threaten and endanger the existence of native and regionally typical flora and fauna, transmit diseases and reduce genetic diversity.
Valuing forest farmers
We support forest owners with their commercial forests, as they create considerable value in rural areas and make a major contribution to binding carbon dioxide in timber and replacing fossil fuels. Measures for the reforestation and sustainable management of forests and the conversion of forests into resilient mixed forests should be sensibly supported by the EU. Only maintenance, thinning and targeted forest conversion make forests sustainable and healthy. This reduces susceptibility to drought damage, pest infestation and weather influences. In addition, a healthy forest lowers the ambient temperature, protects against erosion and, on slopes and mountains, against avalanches and landslides.
Practicing urban climate adaptation
The climate of Europe's major cities is changing adversely. Urban developments should be implemented more sustainably in order to avoid land consumption and urban heating. Urban planning should increasingly provide "green lungs" as air conduits so that cool air is transported from forest areas and fields into the inner areas of urbanized areas. The networking of green infiltration and evaporation areas in urban areas should be implemented to a greater extent. Fine dust and pollutants should be bound, drained and filtered by greening facades and roofs. The excessive solar radiation in urban districts should be used for cooling with intelligent systems.
Introducing uniform animal welfare standards for the whole of Europe
Animal welfare in agriculture must not be reduced by displacing animal husbandry to non- European countries. The same husbandry standards must apply within the EU. National solo efforts must be prevented. We do not want any live animal transports of livestock for slaughter that cross external European borders. We advocate the preservation and expansion of regional slaughterhouses and a revision of the EU standards for these slaughterhouses in order to ensure the shortest possible animal transports. Slaughter on pasture must also be made easier.
Restrict animal testing across Europe
We are committed to ensuring that animal testing is kept to the necessary minimum in Europe as a research location. Whenever possible, preference should be given to cell culture methods and non-animal-based, patient-specific test methods.
30
Europe as a social union
We FREIE WÄHLER are a social political force and regard the welfare state as a great achievement and an important instrument for ensuring security, peace and justice in our society. For us, the provision of benefits and support in many areas, e.g. the family, support for the weaker members of society and accident and pension provision, are central building blocks of a functioning state. We will intervene to correct any shortcomings in the system.
What applies to Germany should also apply to Europe, because here too we demand minimum standards and criticize undesirable developments such as wage dumping, exploitation or social inequalities. At this point, we believe that Europe has a responsibility to take coordinating action. However, we reject a transfer of competence. Social legislation should remain with the member states.
Maintaining social systems as the responsibility of the member states
We are a force that has emerged from the municipalities. We therefore know that specific challenges can be solved most easily at the place where they arise. The member states differ in their structures, social systems and cultural characteristics. For this reason, we reject the transfer of national competences through common unemployment insurance and the transfer of competences in employment services or other social legislation. These should remain in the member states.
Preventing overloading of the social systems
We note with great concern that there has been a massive migration into our social systems in recent years. At some point, this will lead to massive cuts in benefits, for example in health insurance benefits or pensions, or to large increases in contributions for our citizens. In our view, the welfare state as we know and value it is at risk. We will therefore campaign at European level to limit this form of immigration.
Supporting social systems through integration
We are a party for all citizens. Urgent problems such as demographic change, the fragmentation of societies and the shortage of skilled workers are not being tackled decisively enough. We are not giving up on recipients of transfer payments, but rather see great potential in them. We want to actively support many people who are not yet or not yet sufficiently able to participate in social, societal and working life through a policy of demand and support. We are calling for a European pact to ensure cohesion both in the member states and in Europe.
Integrating refugees
We are aware that many immigrants who are currently resident in Germany will stay for the long term. For this reason, we want to promote the integration of immigrant skilled workers and the integration of other migrants into the labor market and society more intensively (e.g. through mandatory German and integration courses), but also demand mandatory integration services from those involved. This should be done independently of our demands for better border protection, repatriation or faster asylum procedures in order to avoid creating parallel societies in the long term, which pose a major threat to social peace.
31
Europe as a guarantor of gender equality
Equality between women and men is a common fundamental value of the European Union. The EU has committed itself to promoting the actual implementation of equal rights and eliminating existing disadvantages through various programs and legislation.
Statistics show that women are underrepresented in leadership positions in politics and business and still earn on average 16% less than men throughout the EU. The long-term consequences and effects on the standard of living of women or their pensions are foreseeable. Violence against women and girls has also not been effectively curbed within the EU, even though corresponding laws and punitive measures have been adopted by the EU.
We FREIE WÄHLER are therefore committed to ensuring that women's policy is further developed in the EU and also taken into account at international level in all types of cooperation.
Consistently enforce existing laws
Several pieces of legislation and agreements have been created by the EU to promote gender equality. We are committed to ensuring that these are reviewed and further developed through evaluation mechanisms and, where necessary, that sanctions are imposed for non-compliance. We can also envisage awards in the form of labels for particularly successful progress towards equality.
Achieving equal pay
The European Council adopted new regulations on pay transparency on April 24, 2023. The EU directive aims to combat pay discrimination and reduce the gender pay gap in the EU. Under the new rules, EU companies must publish information on the wages they pay and take action if their gender pay gap exceeds 5 percent. We advocate the creation of EU-wide standards, monitoring and more consistent implementation of sanctions for companies that do not comply with these laws and standards. The role and independence of equality bodies should also be strengthened.
Promoting women in management positions
Women are still underrepresented in certain professional areas of science, technology, business and politics. We FREIE WÄHLER are committed to programs and qualification measures that address this lack of women in these areas. The digital sector has a special role to play here. We FREIE WÄHLER are committed to ensuring that women have equal access to digital resources in the educational and professional fields. It is also important that care and nursing duties for children and relatives are shared by society in such a way that women are not prevented from working. We FREIE WÄHLER advocate flexible working time models, the expansion of childcare facilities and the promotion of fathers' participation in childcare. There must also be paid leave for family carers and the expansion of care places during family members' recovery periods.
32
Combating violence against women
In 2011, the EU signed the Istanbul Conventions and thereby committed itself to taking measures against violence against women and domestic violence and to supporting their implementation in the member states. The convention is a legally binding instrument that provides for measures to prevent violence, protect victims and punish perpetrators. We FREIE WÄHLER advocate continuous monitoring, evaluation and adaptation of measures to combat violence against women and girls. In particular, funding for programs and projects in this area must be increased.
Breaking down gender stereotypes
We FREIE WÄHLER support programs and measures that break down gender stereotypes and traditional role models in the media or in education and contribute to equal opportunities for men and women.
Strengthening international cooperation for women
Women are still disadvantaged in many areas of the world. They live in relationships of dependency on their husbands, are sometimes not allowed to pursue professional activities with appropriate remuneration, are oppressed or are exposed to social violence. We FREIE WÄHLER call for the EU to increase its influence at international level and to work to provide countries with the expertise to effectively implement gender equality and to support organizations and programmes with this goal.
Europe as a health guarantor
We FREIE WÄHLER want to maintain social and health care that is close to the people and therefore also close to their lives. One of the greatest challenges of our time, demographic change, must be tackled through open discourse in society and by promoting innovative solutions.
Health is our greatest asset. In the changing political and social structures, we stand for maintaining the "openness" of communication with our citizens. In the digital age, despite the targeted use of data, we must not lose sight of data security. Individual patient health data must be protected.
In a time of crisis, people need security above all else. That is why we are committed to maintaining social and health care structures at a regional level.
Maintaining healthcare close to home
We firmly believe that the coordination, structuring and organization of healthcare belongs in the regions. Local decision-makers can assess the needs much better. This is why we want to avoid an expansion of the EU's competencies in the healthcare sector.
Respecting human rights in healthcare
Healthcare from birth to the end of life must be provided with respect for human dignity. This is why sensitive issues such as violence in the delivery room must be addressed,
33
The social and political debate in Europe should focus on violence in care and working conditions in the social and healthcare sectors.
Do not jeopardize vaccination readiness through coercion
Vaccinations are one of the most important preventive measures available in the healthcare system. With their help, many diseases in Europe have been pushed back. For this success story to continue, effective vaccination advice from GPs must be further strengthened. Compulsory vaccination would seriously damage the public's trust in the healthcare system. We reject such considerations.
Preventing a shortage of skilled workers in the healthcare sector
Professional qualifications acquired in Europe in the care, social and education sectors must include the same training standards. We are committed to ensuring that every professional qualification obtained in Europe is equally recognized in every member state.
Preparing the healthcare system for crises and disasters
The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the healthcare systems of the EU member states to their limits. We want to achieve a centralized review of political decisions during the pandemic, which must be scientifically sound and independent. In this way, we want to gain insights to improve pandemic prevention and control in the future. There is no doubt that the member states need to work together to protect and safeguard the population, but also to maintain federalism in crisis and disaster management. Action must focus on protecting and improving health while respecting fundamental and human rights and ensuring equal access to modern and efficient healthcare for all Europeans. The sovereignty, competencies and decision-making powers of the member states should be retained when an international WHO pandemic treaty is concluded.
Strengthening health promotion and prevention
We want to make progress in the fight against widespread diseases such as HIV and malaria. We also want to achieve a reduction in damage to health, e.g. through drug use. To achieve this, it is necessary to identify problems and develop creative solutions. This is why project funding is needed at European level for health and social aspects.
Europe as an educational area
Our younger generations were born into a united Europe. Open borders, a common market and European exchange have been part of their lives from the very beginning. They must be able to maintain and shape these achievements. We need their passion to carry the European idea forward. Because we want the children and young people of today to become the committed and responsible citizens of tomorrow.
In order to ensure a good education for young people in particular and thus guarantee a positive awareness of Europe from the outset, we FREIE WÄHLER are committed to equal educational standards. We must learn with and from each other, especially in school education. Our goal is to ensure that everyone receives a good school education.
34
Committed to continuing the EU Youth Strategy
We want to strengthen European youth policy and improve the dialog between European youth and European policy. We want to create more equal opportunities for young people in education and on the labor market and encourage the younger generation to get involved in society on a voluntary basis.
Fighting youth unemployment together
The opportunities for young people in Europe to find work vary greatly. While we have almost full employment in Germany, in other countries an entire generation is growing up without the prospect of a secure and adequate income. We do not want to leave young people in the lurch. We are promoting our tried-and-tested, crisis-proof dual training system in other EU member states and also want to improve the mobility of young people in Europe. We in Germany are suffering from a high shortage of skilled workers in many sectors and can use this potential to our advantage.
Supporting European youth organizations
We want to strengthen European youth associations. They should provide young people with knowledge and skills in European politics. Strengthened in this way, young people can play an active role in shaping Europe.
Revise European voluntary services
We want to continue to support young people financially when they get involved in non-profit organizations across Europe in areas such as youth work, culture, social work or environmental protection. However, we do not want this instrument to be detrimental to a well-functioning social and youth policy. It must not compete with existing youth exchange programs and volunteer projects and must not be misused as a substitute for traditional jobs. We also advocate the involvement of experienced youth and civil society organizations in the member states in the further development of these programs.
Securing school milk and the school fruit program
We still want our children of primary school age to be provided with fresh milk and healthy fruit in schools. With the help of the relevant EU programs, we want to teach children how to handle basic foodstuffs and introduce them to healthy eating.
Promoting participation
We want to implement inclusion in a self-determined and individual way and not over-regulate it by the state. All measures must be accompanied by appropriate staff. We want to give parents as much freedom of choice as possible and achieve individual support for each person affected. Inclusion cannot be achieved at any price, but must always be based on the interests of all those affected. All people have a right to participation and involvement. To this end, we want to further develop the European strategy for the rights of people with disabilities.
Enabling lifelong learning
Adult education is essential for the further improvement of the general level of education in Europe and should be expanded to a greater extent. We want to make it easier for people to enter professions at a different level and take greater account of non-school qualifications in professional careers. With
35
examples here are internships and parental leave. This recognition must be harmonized across the EU. Taking demographic developments into account, educational opportunities are needed for all age groups.
Strengthening child protection and children's rights
We are firmly committed to child protection and children's rights throughout Europe. This includes the right to a daily balanced meal, the fight against child poverty and social protection for the youngest members of society. Europe must take more decisive action against sexual abuse. We want to protect the living and experiential space of our children and young people from abuse and prevent psychological and physical violence and abuse in educational institutions.
We FREIE WÄHLER want Europe to continue to secure our prosperity. We are working towards this by strengthening Europe as a location for innovation and thus securing high-quality jobs. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our economy. To keep it that way, we support small and medium-sized industrial companies and the skilled trades.
High standards in data and consumer protection force our economy to remain innovative and create a high level of protection for our consumers. At the same time, we want to drastically reduce the requirements and reporting obligations to be met: Our companies do not need more bureaucracy to generate our prosperity, they need more freedom. This applies all the more to small and medium-sized enterprises.
In order for our economy to function, we are committed to a modern and well-functioning infrastructure. We want to expand it quickly and in line with demand, especially for cross-border traffic. We are also committed to ensuring that Europe quickly creates a modern digital infrastructure.
In international trade, we remain committed to defending our high environmental, social and food safety standards and preserving our publicly financed achievements in services of general interest.
Europe as a driver of innovation
Innovation is the key to our international competitiveness, highly skilled jobs and our prosperity. Together, we must ensure that our European industry does not fall behind. Europe must become the lead market for key future technologies and expand or take over the technological leadership role in key technologies. We want to achieve this with an ambitious, holistic innovation policy at European level. To achieve this, the EU must build on its traditional industries - the automotive industry, aviation technology, the chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry and medical technology. But it is also important to catch up internationally in the fields of biotechnology and microelectronics. The same applies to the area of digital technology and the entire field of so-called "green" technologies.
36
Strengthening European research policy
Together, we want to strengthen the European Research Area. Excellence and subsidiarity must continue to be the cornerstones of European research funding. We advocate for Horizon Europe to be endowed with at least the previous budget resources of Horizon 2020. The priorities of education, research and innovation must not be scaled back despite Brexit.
Shaping modern innovation policy
We want to strengthen Europe's capacity for innovation. That is why we are committed to a faster transition of scientific findings into industrial application. We want better networking between industry and science, i.e. with our modern European research centers and universities. In future, the European Union must invest intelligently and ambitiously in research and development in a way that is open to technology and strengthens our knowledge society. In order for new innovations to establish themselves on the market more quickly, there is a need for Europe-wide coordination of demand promotion for many technologies.
Securing Europe's pioneering role in technology
The European Commission has already identified the key areas for an innovative European industry: drive and battery technologies, nanotechnology, biotechnology, microtechnology, smart grids and artificial intelligence. We support innovation in all industrial sectors on the way to a greener and lower-carbon economy. Europe should become a pioneer in these areas in the coming years.
Coordinate tax incentives for innovation
We want to strengthen innovation in Germany and Europe with the help of incentives for research and development. The willingness of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to innovate must be rewarded with tax breaks. In order to strengthen Europe as a location for innovation in this respect, we advocate more intergovernmental coordination.
Advancing joint European battery cell production
The demand for batteries is rising with the increased storage requirements of renewable energies and electromobility. However, Europe is lagging behind the East Asian region in terms of production. But this is precisely where there is great potential for value creation, which we need to secure our jobs and our prosperity. We therefore want to promote research, development and production on a European scale in this area in order to catch up as quickly as possible.
Accelerate European port strategy
The national ports on the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts are indispensable for Germany's future energy security and must therefore be better networked at European level and upgraded in terms of infrastructure as quickly as possible. We are therefore calling for the planned national port strategy to be accelerated and coordinated with our European partners in a targeted manner in order to secure jobs in the port industry, diversify the energy supply and promote the hydrogen economy.
37
Expanding the European aerospace industry
We want to promote joint aircraft and engine programs in Europe. We want to secure the participation of medium-sized German companies in aerospace projects and promote the development of innovative products in Germany. We are committed to ensuring that the European Space Agency (ESA) retains and strengthens its independence. We also want to create a common European legal framework for non-governmental space activities.
Promoting the development of computer games in Europe
We want to promote Europe as a games location. Computer games have become an important cultural asset throughout Europe. It is an important branch of the creative sector with high growth potential. That is why we want to introduce a European computer games prize and launch our own European funding model for the young and innovative games industry.
Promoting software development in Europe
With very few exceptions, virtually none of the widely used (user) software products come from Europe. Europe is currently extremely dependent on non-European suppliers, which we want to minimize. Only competitive software products "made in Europe" guarantee the necessary level of data security and data protection, also with a view to the ever-increasing problem of "cyberwar" in the future.
Guaranteeing the protection of minors with computer games
Computer games are now part of the everyday culture of many children and young people. In principle, we believe it is necessary to continue to promote the audiovisual industry in Europe. The protection of minors must therefore apply to the entire audiovisual sector, including on- demand services, video streaming platforms, etc. For those areas where it is technically possible, we also call for the use of all currently suitable technical methods to verify compliance with the protection of minors. In particular, to protect young people from video games, we call for European harmonization of both age recommendations and content ratings. The rating should be made clear on the game packaging by means of various clear symbols. One problem is the increasing trend that content essential to the game can often only be unlocked through additional purchases. This business model quickly becomes an unmanageable cost trap for children and young people. We therefore advocate stricter protection of minors at this point. The same youth protection standards should apply to advertising within games as to the games themselves. Pure games of chance - even if played without monetary gain - should be classified in a higher age group or should not be available to minors.
Strengthening culture and the creative industries in Europe
We want to strengthen the European cultural and creative industries. We want to support music, books, art, films and other areas. In particular, we want to improve the cultural offer in rural areas. We stand by fixed book prices and reject liberalizing interventions at European level in this area. We are committed to the creation, preservation, promotion and expansion of cultural institutions, educational opportunities and activities.
38
Combating antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to our health in Europe. The options for treating bacterial infections are dwindling and we are increasingly having to resort to reserve antibiotics. Due to a lack of sufficient references to indications for the use of antibiotics and an insufficient reduction in the general use of antibiotics, the number of cases of resistance to these reserve antibiotics is already rising. In order to achieve rapid success, we must particularly promote research efforts for additional treatment options in human and veterinary medicine at European level. At the same time, we are campaigning for Europe-wide recommendations on antibiotic prescribing practices based on the principles of ABS (Antibiotic Stewardship).
Expanding European pharmaceutical production
We want to develop and produce the best medicines and medical products for our health locally in accordance with European standards and thus promote Europe's independence from suppliers from third countries. That is why we want to promote pharmaceutical research and development at European level. We will uphold the ban on the supply of pharmaceutical products that are used to carry out the death penalty in non-European countries.
Protecting key technologies
We are committed to common European rules to protect important key technologies such as robotics. We must prevent strategic takeovers from countries such as China. We want to supplement our national and European foreign trade instruments accordingly.
Advancing the European Education Area
We fundamentally support the efforts to create a European education area in order to offer the best conditions for the bright minds of tomorrow. Europe's ability to innovate depends on this. However, it must not be a question of handing over responsibilities upwards in this area, but of developing the best education policy for our society in voluntary coordination with our neighbors. To this end, we want to create more cross-border cooperation between the member states and their regions in the field of education. We see the Erasmus+ program as an important instrument for promoting exchange within Europe.
Europe as a single market
We live in the largest single market in the world. Duty-free trade has secured our prosperity and jobs for decades. Common standards, from power plugs to exhaust emission standards for our cars, make it easier for our economy to produce for a very large market with the same rules.
Our attention is focused on the existing challenges facing our medium-sized economy. We FREIE WÄHLER want to give it real prospects again by creating the best framework conditions for it, avoiding competition-distorting regulations and guaranteeing individual responsibility and subsidiarity as the highest guidelines in European economic policy. Here, too, we advocate a consistent reduction in bureaucracy and stand up for
39
We are facing up to the overwhelming transparency, reporting and monitoring regulations. In the coming years, it will be particularly important to find the right answers to the trends of globalization, digitalization and artificial intelligence. We are fighting for a social market economy in Europe that serves its citizens.
Completing the digital single market
Our future lies in digitalization. Europe can position itself at the forefront of global competition if we make our common market fit for this challenge. It must not matter from where citizens access websites. We want to consistently remove obstacles to digital offerings due to different national regulations in order to create new opportunities for our small and medium-sized enterprises.
Living the start-up culture in Europe
We want uniform rules to sustainably strengthen the start-up culture in Europe. It is important to us to ensure the uniform application of European law and to find a common definition for "start- up" in order to coordinate support measures across Europe in a targeted manner.
Aligning economic policy with SMEs
Large corporations can often cope with EU regulations without any problems, while small and medium-sized companies can hardly cope with the burden of the requirements. We advocate regulation that does justice to small and medium-sized enterprises throughout Europe and protects them from excessive bureaucracy. Reporting and notification obligations must be continuously evaluated and checked for their justification. Authorities must explain and justify the purpose for which data is collected and what happens to the statistical material. In future, there must be a one-in-two-out rule. If new reporting and notification obligations are introduced, others must be dropped.
Securing the supply of credit
We are committed to ensuring that banking regulation is SME-friendly. It must not make it more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to access financing. In particular, the capital adequacy requirements must be handled very sensitively. The introduction of ESG criteria must not lead to an impediment or even a deterioration in the supply of credit, particularly for SMEs and craft businesses. The introduction of a Green Supporting Factor or a Brown Penalizing Factor in the context of capital adequacy is strictly rejected. Supervisory regulations must only serve to maintain financial stability at micro and macro level and must not be associated with structural policy intentions. Supervisory regulations must remain primarily the responsibility of the European Parliament and the European Council. The application of delegated acts to extend the powers of the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, ESMA and EIOPA) has led to increased lack of transparency, legal uncertainty and excessive regulation. The density of regulation has far exceeded the acceptable level that can be implemented by the supervised financial market players.
Making data protection law SME-friendly
We are committed to a SME-friendly revision of European data protection law. Particularly with regard to the ePrivacy Regulation, it is important to maintain scope for innovation and digital business models. At European level, we want to establish a high-level working
40
group with practitioners from SMEs, the digital economy and the voluntary sector to submit proposals for practicable reforms. This working group should also modernize the GDPR and ensure meaningful data protection vis-à-vis third parties and the state.
Receive master craftsman training
We are campaigning at European level for the retention of master craftsman training. It guarantees high-quality services in the skilled trades and ensures their continued existence. In order to enhance the value of vocational training, particularly in the skilled trades, it should be brought more into line with free university studies through public funding of master craftsman training.
Combating the shortage of skilled workers
While there is a lack of jobs in many European countries, there is a considerable shortage of skilled workers in a number of sectors in Germany. We therefore want to improve the mobility of workers in Europe and advocate better comparability of educational standards and the common B2 language level as a reference basis.
More targeted promotion of tourism regions
We want to further improve the framework conditions for tourism in Germany. To this end, we want to dovetail the funding instruments of the EU, the federal government and the federal states more closely.
Preventing industrial espionage
We are committed to a European strategy against international industrial espionage. In this way, we want to advise small and medium-sized enterprises in particular and protect their knowledge and intellectual property from unauthorized access.
Europe as consumer protector
We FREIE WÄHLER are committed to a high level of consumer protection in Europe. The precautionary principle in environmental and health policy has priority: products and services whose disadvantages and harmfulness to people, the environment and nature cannot be ruled out must not be allowed onto the European market.
In the course of digitalization, data protection is playing an increasingly important role. A single European digital single market requires common and practicable standards for all users.
Ensuring secure data exchange
We are committed to the secure exchange of data with other economic areas. This is a prerequisite for the success of the German and European digital economy. Effective multilateral agreements are needed to protect data exchange at European level.
Strengthening the principle of net neutrality
We advocate the preservation of net neutrality. Fair competition for the best products is only possible if all data is forwarded with the same priority regardless of source, destination and content. Favoring or discriminating against certain competitors or content prevents innovation in the long term. This is detrimental to Europe as a business location.
41
Enforcing price transparency
We are committed to ensuring that all consumers are shown the same prices on online comparison and advice portals and that there is no manipulation with the help of algorithms.
Maintaining the safety of medical products
We want medicinal products and medical device studies to consistently meet the recognized standards for the protection of human research and for the studies to be subject to mandatory publication. These must also be publicly announced before they are carried out in order to reduce publication bias.
Europe as a legislator
Where the EU inhibits the entrepreneurial spirit of people and companies, the acceptance of our work of peace suffers. Reducing bureaucracy, on the other hand, is the best economic stimulus program. We therefore want Europe to focus on its key challenges. We stand for a Europe with less bureaucracy and less superfluous regulation. However, we want more cooperation where it offers citizens real added value.
Introducing the paragraph brake for Europe
We want to counteract the increase in bureaucratic requirements in European legislation. These affect small and medium-sized enterprises, the skilled trades and voluntary work in particular. In addition, we want to prevent the transposition of EU directives into national law from triggering a further flood of paragraphs by federal and state legislators in Germany.
Form committee to reduce bureaucracy
The reduction of bureaucracy is an important core issue of European policy, which is why we are calling for a dedicated committee for this topic in the EU Parliament. We will also campaign for the BRIDGE-EU (Border Regency Initiative for Development and Growth in Europe) program.
Ensuring that EU laws are suitable for SMEs
We will campaign in Europe for implementable EU legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises. They must be largely relieved of European reporting obligations. We also want to exploit the potential of e-government, in particular to reduce the bureaucratic burden caused by European law and speed up administrative procedures.
Continuing the "strike list policy"
We are committed to ensuring that the EU Commission refrains from passing unnecessary or outdated laws. We want to continue to reduce bureaucracy in the EU in this way in the future. We will work to ensure that the reduction of bureaucracy also becomes a guiding principle in the structures of the EU Parliament.
Simplify public procurement law
We want to streamline European public procurement law in the interests of cities and municipalities and adjust the threshold values upwards. It must once again be possible for our mayors and district councils to carry out public procurement without time-consuming and expensive legal advice.
42
organize. In addition, awarding contracts could be significantly less time-consuming. When awarding contracts, the regional reference should be given a higher value - despite Europe-wide tendering.
Europe as a digital location
We FREIE WÄHLER are a party of progress and are committed to using technological developments without ideology for the benefit of European citizens. At the same time, we are aware that these also entail major challenges. Our aim is therefore to create a balance between development and our high social standards.
Digitalization is a European topic of the future. Digital companies have improved our lives. It is noticeable that the EU is lagging behind other regions of the world in the digital world. We need to create an environment in which a large number of small, medium-sized and large digital companies can flourish in the EU. Overly complicated framework conditions create disadvantages in this future market, especially for small companies. As a responsible force in the political center, we approach digitalization optimistically, but not naively.
Targeted regulation of social media and market-dominating digital companies
In recent years, Brussels has created the extensive DMA and DSA digital laws. These regulations are sensible approaches to counteract digital monopolies and to combat the most serious excesses in social networks. The concrete application in the coming years will show to what extent readjustment is necessary. The potential for addiction and political manipulation by extremist parties in Germany as well as political influence by foreign forces are aspects where it would appear to make sense to sharpen the focus.
Shaping digital progress in a socially responsible way
We see it as our task to create a balance between future technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics or digital industrial applications and social standards, whether in the personal environment or at work. New technologies should support people, not burden or even replace them. We want to weigh up the opportunities and risks with the help of experts.
Advancing digitalization in urban and rural areas
Digitization must be driven forward in the municipalities and at state authorities. Citizens must be offered more opportunities to carry out administrative procedures digitally. The digital connection of rural areas must be at the same level as in metropolitan areas. Working from home must also be possible without restrictions in rural areas.
Digitizing justice and law enforcement
The expansion of digitization in the area of justice and law enforcement is lagging behind. Secure data exchange within European countries should be possible without restriction. This will relieve the burden on the judiciary in the European states.
Promoting broadband expansion
Fast internet should be available to all citizens. The expansion with fiber optics and 5G must continue. Schools, business, administration and private households should have optimal conditions for internet access at reasonable prices.
43
Protect personal data
We are committed to the protection of personal data. For reasons of data security, data centers must be operated in Europe and not in the USA or Asia. We want to create a secure European data space and an effective European data strategy in compliance with existing data protection rules.
Continuing the gigabit offensive
To ensure that all citizens have equal access to digital opportunities, a reliable infrastructure in the form of nationwide coverage with fiber optic networks is necessary. This applies in particular to rural areas, which are often neglected. We will continue to ensure European funding for digital data networks and work to ensure that European state aid law does not stand in the way of state funding efforts.
Developing a lead market for 5G technology
We want Europe to play a leading role in the introduction of the 5G standard, taking health aspects into account. Many future technologies, such as autonomous driving, depend on nationwide availability. We rely on intelligent solutions to make this a reality. To ensure that not every network operator builds its own network for the radio masts and that there is full network coverage even in rural areas, we are striving for a division of labor via "national roaming".
Europe as a guarantee of mobility
An efficient infrastructure is a prerequisite for an economically successful Europe. It must enable people, goods and services to reach their destinations quickly and reliably. Intra- European roads, waterways and railways must be adapted to the required capacities and should be state of the art. We FREIE WÄHLER want safe, clean, efficient and user-friendly transport. For example, there is great potential to reduce intra-European air traffic through efficient rail connections between the major cities.
We are in favor of open-technology drive research in the transport sector. Solutions for reducing emissions should not be politically and ideologically predetermined, but should develop through competition for the best ideas.
For the requirements of rural areas with their long distances, combustion engines in combination with biologically or synthetically produced fuels can represent a climate-neutral alternative. We therefore reject a one-sided focus on the promotion of electric vehicles. Traffic routes should always remain public and be bought back if necessary. They are essential for the infrastructure and do not belong in private hands.
Preventing car tolls
We continue to oppose the introduction of a car toll in Germany, which is contrary to European law, and are committed to ensuring that everyone can afford the mobility that suits them and that no new burdens artificially increase the cost of their mobility.
44
Promoting local public transport in border regions
Especially in European border regions, people often do not work and live in the same country and commute across the border. We want to create incentives for cities and municipalities in bordering member states to work better together in the choice of means of transport and mobility management. We want to increase the attractiveness of cross-border public transport.
Supporting sustainable mobility in the EU
We support and demand more EU measures for more sustainable mobility in Europe. Shared use of cars (car sharing) should be promoted - especially in rural areas. Efficient exhaust emission limits must be further developed with a view to feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Internal combustion cars should remain affordable and e-cars should become affordable. The further expansion of the hydrogen infrastructure must be promoted.
Expanding public transport services
We are committed to expanding local public transport services. In addition to school transport, rural areas should be connected to the central and upper city several times a day. Accessibility for people with limited mobility must be ensured across the board.
Guaranteeing affordable mobility
The use of public transport should be permanently affordable - additional social tariffs are needed for people with low incomes and physical disabilities. The efficiency of public transport must be guaranteed by the Member States. Desolate conditions such as those in German train services must be prevented.
Expanding safe cycle paths
The expansion of cross-border cycle paths should be promoted by the EU. By increasing the use of e-bikes, part of the traffic can be shifted to environmentally friendly cycling. Particular attention must be paid to the safety of cycle paths.
Strengthening trans-European transport networks
A good transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for economic success and requires reliable and fast railroads, roads and waterways so that people and goods can reach their destination quickly, safely and economically. We call for the rapid expansion of the major European transport axes so that not only the large metropolitan areas benefit, but rural areas are also connected in the best possible way.
Solving major traffic problems
Europe should concentrate on the essentials in transport policy. We reject excessive regulation without cross-border significance and European added value. For this reason, we will continue to oppose ideas such as a uniform European speed limit or a Europe-wide requirement for cyclists to wear high-visibility vests. We also reject tachograph regulations that are hostile to SMEs.
Creating a European freight route system
We are campaigning at European level for a common freight route system. Freight traffic with European goods is increasing between Genoa and Rotterdam. We are therefore calling for the accelerated implementation of the European infrastructure program for the new planning of
45
High-speed and freight transportation routes, such as the Westerwald-Taunus Tunnel. In the case of projects such as the Brenner northern approach, attention must be paid to the use of existing infrastructure and land-saving planning. We also want to achieve the mandatory establishment of measuring stations in order to monitor and reduce noise pollution in Europe.
Further expanding night train connections in Europe
We are campaigning for the expansion of night train connections in Europe as an environmentally friendly alternative to flights. To ensure that the service is also competitively priced in Germany, we are campaigning for a reduction in the rail toll for night trains.
Improving cross-border inland waterway connections
We want to expand the so-called freeways of the sea across all modes of transport. We want to further strengthen the planned high-performance transport network, consisting of short sea shipping in conjunction with the land transport carriers of the Trans-European Network (TEN-T). To this end, all member states must develop efficient seaport and hinterland terminals in order to create an efficient, environmentally friendly and climate-friendly transport network.
Drives of the future
E-fuels, biofuels, gas, hydrogen, grid-connected or battery-powered electromobility can be important building blocks for the climate-friendly transformation of the transport sector, provided that the fuel is produced sustainably. The task of politics is to promote research and development in all technologies so that Europe remains the top location for vehicle production. Emission-reduced mobility improves the quality of life, especially in cities. Electric, hydrogen and natural gas buses in local public transport make an important contribution. We see the Europe-wide development of the necessary infrastructure for charging and refueling vehicles with alternative fuels as an effective way of promoting the respective technology.
Connecting European capitals
We support the expansion of fast rail transport between major European cities. Good frequencies and night-time connections should offer a real alternative to air travel. We are committed to the creation of a European transport network system that simplifies the purchase of cross-border tickets and enables season tickets.
Expand shore power supply
We want to expand the supply of shore-side electricity in all European ports to reduce emissions from shipping during lay times.
Europe as a trading power
Europe is facing major challenges in international trade: We FREIE WÄHLER do not want the trading power China, among others, to try to dictate the future rules of world trade to us, far removed from our values. We want to do everything in our power to ensure that Europe maintains its current strength in international trade and concludes free trade agreements in the interests of its citizens.
46
We stand for a value-based trade policy that makes high standards and the commitments from the Paris Climate Agreement the basis for joint trade. We stand for growth, sustainability and justice.
Strengthening SMEs in international trade
Trade barriers are significant obstacles, especially for small and medium-sized exporting companies. We are committed to ensuring that they in particular, as the backbone of our economy, benefit more from international trade in the future.
Remove services of general interest from trade agreements
We will work hard to ensure that public services such as drinking water supply and wastewater disposal do not come under pressure from Brussels and international trade to be privatized. We are campaigning for unassailable exceptions for such sensitive areas when new trade rules are agreed and for our cities and municipalities to continue to have full sovereignty over the design and organization of the provision of public services.
Revive world trade rounds
We advocate a revival of world trade rounds within the WTO framework. The EU's current policy, which focuses too strongly on agreements with individual trading partners, is not the ideal path for us. We want to focus more on a uniform regulation in international trade to which all 164 WTO states commit themselves.
Meeting developing countries fairly
We want to achieve a value-based re-foundation of European trade policy, particularly in trade with Africa. Trade and fisheries agreements that cause poverty and misery and thus promote growing migration to Europe must finally be replaced by fair and sustainable agreements. The private sector profits that are currently being made in Africa through unfair trade practices bear no relation to the social costs of the increasing migratory pressure on Europe.
Banning trade in conflict minerals
We want to take decisive action against the use of mineral resources from conflict or high-risk regions. The EU regulation on trade in conflict minerals provides a good framework and must be consistently implemented by the member states. We also want to advocate for the abolition of exemption limits and their extension to the entire supply chain.
We FREIE WÄHLER want to return to a stable currency and the principle that e a c h country is liable for its own debts. Our monetary union must become a stability union. We want to prevent the debt policies of individual countries from further burdening and endangering our entire economic system and taxpayers.
The EU has to tackle many international challenges such as migration, border protection and counter-terrorism and cyber defense. We believe that adequate funding for these major tasks is urgently needed, especially as it is less costly and more effective than individual national solutions. We want to continue important expenditure items such as regional funding at the current level.
47
Europe as a currency area
We FREIE WÄHLER want to correct the misguided euro rescue policy of recent years. We do not want to further develop instruments that have been created provisionally, but rather reduce them. Every country must be liable for its own debts; violations of the Stability and Growth Pact must be consistently punished.
Stop the debt union
"Every country is liable for its own debts" - we continue to advocate this principle. We firmly reject the communitization of debt in the form of common bonds or o t h e r instruments. We want to end the EU debt created with the so-called reconstruction fund as quickly as possible and return to the EU's debt ban.
Reforming the Stability and Growth Pact
We are committed to reforming the Stability and Growth Pact. Future violations should be automatically punished and sanctioned. In this way, we will achieve greater budgetary discipline and prevent the stability of our monetary union from being dependent on political decisions.
Realigning the ECB
The independence of the central bank from political influence remains very important to us. However, we want the voting rights of the national central banks in the ECB to be granted internally according to the corresponding liability shares. We also want a system change towards an annual repayment of Target balances through gold. Furthermore, we advocate a blocking minority of 25% of the votes if ECB measures could lead to a redistribution of assets between eurozone countries. We want the remuneration of the ECB leadership to be performance-oriented. They should receive bonuses if they manage to keep inflation close to 2 percent and only low salaries if the ECB falls well short of its inflation target.
Dissolve the ESM
We want to dismantle the European Stability Mechanism as a hastily introduced crisis instrument by gradually reducing the ESM's lending capacity.
Preventing the European Monetary Fund
The European Commission plans to develop the European Stability Mechanism into a European Monetary Fund. We firmly reject this. This would create a set of instruments that would deprive national parliaments of any remaining control and, at the same time, would result in very high levels of state aid in the event of a crisis. In addition, there is no need for a duplicate structure to the International Monetary Fund, which has long been in existence and works extremely well.
Breaking the "vicious circle" between states and banks
During the euro crisis, the so-called "doom loop" became clear: states cannot go bankrupt because otherwise the banks will go bankrupt. And banks cannot go bankrupt because otherwise the states will go bankrupt. This vicious circle makes the member states vulnerable to blackmail. We are striving to break this mutual dependency by shaping banking regulation in the sense of risk-adequate pricing, i.e. by not regulating government bonds in particular.
48
are no longer considered risk-free by definition. Removing this disincentive will lead to banks reducing their exposure to government bonds, thus breaking the vicious circle.
Introduce orderly state insolvency proceedings
We want clear rules in the event of the insolvency of a euro state. This requires an independent body to monitor the process. The International Monetary Fund could take on this task. Binding rules should ensure that insolvency proceedings are completed within a set period of time and that debt restructuring negotiations cannot be delayed.
Regulating the exit procedure from the monetary union
We advocate clear rules for exiting the eurozone. In future, it must be clear what happens to a member state if it becomes an unacceptable burden on the eurozone. So far, the treaties only allow for a complete withdrawal from the EU. By leaving the eurozone, however, a crisis-ridden EU member state can return to a national currency and gradually regain its competitiveness through devaluation.
Combating corruption, tax fraud and money laundering
A lot of money in Europe bypasses the treasury of the member states. As a result, states are more indebted than necessary or many important projects cannot be realized. We want to change this: We want decisive action against corruption, tax fraud and money laundering internationally and in Europe. We advocate more cooperation at EU level. However, the last word on the subject of taxes must remain with the member states.
Creating a European financial transaction levy
We are in favor of a financial transaction levy. However, regulation here only makes sense within a larger European framework. We therefore advocate a European transaction levy at this point. We want to allocate the resulting revenue to the EU budget as additional own resources. Private capital formation and the formation of pension capital should be exempt from this financial transaction levy. However, the financial transaction levy should only be introduced if the cost-benefit ratio justifies it.
Exempting savings banks and cooperative banks from the EU deposit guarantee scheme We will continue to oppose a European deposit guarantee scheme that jeopardizes the proven investor protection in Germany and even indirectly the solvency of businesses and commercial enterprises. We do not want our solidly operating savings banks and cooperative banks to be forced to assume joint liability for ailing banks.
Enable special treatment of regionally active banks
We are committed to preserving our proven German three-pillar banking model. Especially in times of crisis, our banking structure has proven its worth for savers, investors and the SME sector. We clearly reject Brussels' repeated attempts to call into question the structure of our savings banks and cooperative banks. After all, they are important financial partners for many people and companies in our country. We will continue to make a distinction in regulation between savings banks, cooperative banks and development banks.
49
The small banks with low-risk business models should be distinguished from the systemically important large banks. The small institutions must not have to bear the burden of the special control requirements of the large ones.
Receive cash
We oppose the efforts to abolish our cash. In view of increasing cyber attacks, we consider it highly negligent to rely exclusively on electronic payment transactions. The security policy goals of traceability of all transactions will not be achieved anyway if there are alternatives to other currencies, voucher systems or cryptocurrencies. In addition, the power of banks and state organizations will increase if it is no longer possible to keep cash at home.
Reject the digital euro as the sole means of payment
We are critical of a digital euro. We would only accept such a digital euro if it fulfills all of the following points: Firstly, it must not be implemented as a substitute for cash. Secondly, it must meet very high standards of data protection and anonymity. Thirdly, it must not invite bank runs. Fourthly, it must not be used for social scoring systems.
Europe as a housekeeper
Europe must become more economical and efficient in the execution of common tasks, but at the same time have sufficient financial resources at its disposal to be able to fulfill the large and important tasks. We FREIE WÄHLER are therefore committed to an EU that handles German taxpayers' money responsibly and limits itself to its central tasks. At the same time, we want fairer contributions in the EU in order to reduce the burden on Germany.
We Free Voters want to make more targeted use of European funding to reduce differences between urban and rural areas and to better network the regions with each other. In this way, we are striving for equality of living conditions between urban and rural areas. To achieve this, we need to further optimize European regional and structural policy for our municipalities. The current funding policy is inefficient, non-transparent and too bureaucratic.
Making the EU budget transparent
We are committed to ensuring that the public can better understand the EU budget, the focus of spending and its added value. In particular, we expect the Commission to return to publishing the "operational budget balances" and thus make it clear to citizens which member states are net contributors and which are net recipients. We want all social actors to be equally involved in budget discussions, regardless of their lobby budget. This includes representative associations, social partners, initiatives and other stakeholders. In this way, we want to create more acceptance for the EU's political goals.
50
Taxing large corporations fairly
Internationally active companies must no longer shirk their social responsibility. Just like SMEs, they must pay appropriate taxes here if they generate profits in Europe. We continue to advocate that multinational corporations and in particular internet companies such as Alphabet, Alibaba, Apple, Meta and Amazon are finally held accountable.
Realigning European regional funding
We a r e committed to a policy that ensures economic and social cohesion in all regions of Europe. We want to enable structurally weaker regions to catch up through their own efforts. The improvement and reorientation of regional funding in the EU should take place at various levels. The promotion of employment, education and opportunities for social inclusion must be strengthened. The promotion of research and innovation must be increased. The modernization of the transport and energy sectors should be driven forward. EU regional funding should be improved by focusing more strongly on the areas and sectors in which the greatest progress can be expected. Projects that strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises in the areas of trade, commerce, agriculture and services should be given priority. The EU's digital agenda should be driven forward more strongly. We a d v o c a t e graduated access to regional funding according to the level of development of the regions. The regions should be divided into three categories for this purpose (less developed regions, transition regions and more developed regions). We want to evaluate this classification on an ongoing basis.
Making EU funding more practical
Applying for EU funding remains impractical. Against this background, we want to revise the funding system and tailor it better to the existing conditions. However, the own contribution to be made is important. It prevents projects with high costs and minimal added value from being implemented.

Election program
for the 2024 European
European elections 2024: Together for European independence
War, poverty and social inequality, ecological collapse, the rise of anti-democratic forces - in 2024, our society is facing existential crises that are completely unclear as to whether and how they will be overcome. An ambiguity that results from the fact that those who wield power, namely the rich, large corporations and politicians who serve them, make decisions behind closed doors. This leads to decisions that prioritize profit over people and the planet. Oligarchic power structures have become the biggest insecurity factor for peace and prosperity in Europe today. MERA25 wants to put an end to these conditions.
We strive for the people to take control of our common destiny instead, not those who only have profit in mind. We at MERA25 b e l i e v e t h a t i t i s t i m e f o r Europe's people to democratically decide how our economy is run, how public money is spent, how the housing, healthcare and education backlogs are made up, how peace is achieved and, ultimately, what future we want to see. Only together, across borders, can we successfully tackle the urgent challenges of our time, including:
? Increasing inequality: the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer;
? Falling standard of living: Prices for basic goods have skyrocketed, while there is less and less affordable housing;
? Environmental disasters and planetary heating: time is running out to stop climate change;
? War: We do not want any support for wars, no armament spirals, no dangerous logic of military deterrence and no new bloc confrontation;
? Genocide in Gaza: Together with the voices of the Palestinian movement and the international community, we denounce Israeli apartheid, genocide and German complicity;
? Disenchantment with politics: The loss of trust in state institutions and the political establishment promotes the acceptance of authoritarianism and discrimination against minorities;
? Dwindling public services: Public goods are increasingly being privatized, and equal and needs-based service provision is no longer a given.
What we are experiencing today is the result of political decisions that favor the few in our society and forget the many. It is therefore not surprising that one in six people in the European Union is considered to be at risk of poverty, while at the same time the number of billionaires has risen to almost 400. This trend is the result of a fatal link between ruling parties and powerful companies whose only goal is profit.
It is time to say: enough is enough! An alternative path must be taken that allows people to make their own decisions about their lives. A path that enables an affordable and self-determined life for people in Europe and beyond! As Europeans of diverse backgrounds, we share a peace-loving, deeply internationalist conviction and want to finally be able to live and decide independently!
Here you can find the European election program of MERA25: Financial independence for all
Job guarantee good wages
Four-day week lifetime income
We are fighting for fair wages across Europe to reduce inequality, guided by the welfare state model of strong trade unions and a society without poverty. Our goal is a dignified working life for all with the introduction of a four-day week. By offering a European Job Guarantee, we will create meaningful and dignified employment opportunities outside the private sector in areas such as care work, nursing, nature conservation, culture and popular sports. In addition, we aim to introduce a Europe-wide Universal Living Income of 60% of the median income in the respective countries in the medium term to enable everyone to live a dignified and purposeful life free from interference, poverty and exploitation.
Measures against inflation and loss of purchasing power
Price reductions for essential goods Profit brakes for the corporations
To make everyday goods affordable, we want to abolish European Union laws that artificially raise prices (e.g. on the electricity market) and abolish VAT on essential goods (e.g. water, food, medicines, household energy). We will enact legislation that makes it impossible for pharmaceutical companies to keep drug prices high through anti-social patenting. Sectors dominated by a few large corporations will be reformed to eliminate monopolies and oligopolies. Margin controls to prevent excess profits and direct price subsidies in the event of economic shocks due to supply shortages are among the instruments that must be used to react flexibly and appropriately to cost increases.
Green transformation
paid for by climate polluters
Free public transport Regenerative energy supply Ecological agriculture
We have launched an ambitious program to restore nature and preserve livelihoods. Our Green New Deal for Europe is the only investment program that combines climate protection, social security and democracy. It includes creating decent green jobs, making all local public transport in Europe free or cheap, supporting companies in switching to climate-neutral production, consistently transforming the energy supply to be renewable and oriented towards the common good, converting agriculture to organic and animal welfare- oriented methods, enabling healthy nutrition for all and making building and living ecologically sound.
more sustainable. This green transformation for the people should leave no one behind and should be paid for by the super-rich. To this end, we will campaign for the introduction of a progressive wealth tax. This solidarity tax will be levied on people who directly or indirectly own net assets of 2 million or more, thus exempting 99% of the European population.
Economic paradigm shift: one person, one voice
Socialization of basic goods (e.g. housing, electricity, heat, water)
Our vision is a world in which people live together freely and without constraints. To get closer to this vision, we want to democratize companies and corporations in the long term. "One person, one vote" must also apply in the world of work. This applies in particular to listed companies. It is not shareholders who create value, but the employees of a company. It should therefore be the employees who make key decisions, such as the choice of management, the distribution of funds and other fundamental decisions that affect the future of the workforce and the company. Sectors and infrastructure in Europe that form natural monopolies, as well as basic goods and utility services for a dignified life (e.g. electricity, heat, water, but also Internet access), will be assigned to the sovereign remit of the state and will be socialized or transferred to democratically managed public ownership where this is not already the case.
Peaceful international relations
Independence Non- alignment
peaceful conflict resolution
We want an independent and non-aligned European Union committed to global peace. A comprehensive international security framework should replace military blocs and resolve tensions by peaceful means. The Europe we aspire to will ensure social and environmental justice within and between nations, end the dominance of one country over another and maintain peaceful and independent relations with Washington, Moscow and Beijing. No country dominates another. Too many countries and their populations have been pushed into chaos, death and displacement by avoidable wars. Europe must take a courageous stand against all aggressors from any bloc and work for peaceful conflict resolution based on the UN Charter. To this end, we want not only to reform the United Nations, but also to strengthen arms control protocols in Europe, starting with the adoption of the treaty banning nuclear weapons throughout the continent and ending with global nuclear and military disarmament. We will push for the initiation of a peace process under UN auspices in Israel-Palestine, Ukraine, Western Sahara and elsewhere.
Solidarity and respect for human rights
Human being equals human being
Freedom of movement is a fundamental right
A peaceful and trusting coexistence of all people is the basis for prosperity and our ultimate goal. We firmly oppose fundamentalist and fascist endeavors and misanthropy. Our policy is based on the Geneva Conventions, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights for everyone, regardless of their country of birth. We recognize that migration is an extreme circumstance and rarely happens voluntarily and lightly. Therefore, we say no to the current European migration policy, whose main elements are externalization, border hardening, detention, rapid deportation and criminalization. In addition, European foreign policy is contributing to the global climate crisis through economic pressure, support for wars and climate-damaging
This action contributes significantly to forced migration, one of the targets of which are the EU member states. We support all municipalities in Europe that take in migrants and give them equal access to housing, work, healthcare and social participation. Our job guarantee, universal living income and access to common goods including education and housing will prevent the pitting of different population groups against each other. In addition, we will fight for the rights of women and minorities throughout the European Union. Human trafficking and gender-based violence will be added to the list of criminal offenses and all national legislation in EU countries will be aligned with the provisions of the Istanbul Convention.
The basis for prosperity:
A democratized euro
A payment platform for the many instead of a financial system for the few
With monetary policy as the exclusive playing field of an unelected elite of technocratic central bankers, a fundamental component of the political sphere has been almost completely removed from any democratic influence since the introduction of the euro and the establishment of the supposed independence of the European Central Bank (ECB). We oppose the ECB's arbitrary decisions regarding key interest rates, bond purchases and other monetary policy instruments, which are ineffective and misguided attempts to combat inflation on the backs of the working majority of European society and have massively promoted the extreme growth in wealth of a few oligarchs in recent years. We want to incorporate the area of monetary policy, analogous to fiscal policy, into the democratic sphere and transfer the political steering of the ECB to a strengthened European Parliament in order to democratically legitimize decisions on monetary policy in the future and coordinate them with the Parliament's budgetary agenda. We are also committed to an enabling monetary policy and will use the resulting opportunities to resolutely drive forward the socio-ecological transformation on our continent. Finally, we want to abolish the unjustified oligopoly of the commercial banking sector in payment transactions and implement a public digital payment platform that allows Europe's citizens to make transactions with hard digital central bank money (sovereign money) while complying with strict data protection requirements.
Real democracy
in a united Europe
Freedom Equality Transparency
We know: Europe must be democratized or it will disintegrate. That is why we are committed to the further development of the European Union into a federal European republic with the cornerstones of freedom as non-domination, legal equality, separation of powers and civil society participation. In it, the citizens of Europe should be able to elect a common, democratically sovereign and truly transnational parliament as well as other legislative bodies. In line with the concept of deliberative democracy, randomly drawn citizens' assemblies with binding decision-making powers at all administrative levels should act as an additional check and corrective to government policy and, by directly involving the population in the political process, reduce disenchantment with politics and strengthen trust in democratic institutions. The regulatory framework of this Europe should no longer be the nation states, but regions and cities. A constituent assembly should draw up and adopt a new social contract for the establishment of the European Republic to replace the existing neoliberal EU treaties.

We are convinced Europeans
In Europe with its long common history, in which there were many wars against each other, a nucleus of peaceful coexistence was created with the European Union. The values of the EU, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities [...] are common to all Member States in a society characterized by pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men (Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union). For the Ecological Democratic Party (ÖDP), these are the driving force behind its commitment to the EU and Europe as a whole. The EU's goal of promoting peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples (Art. 3 of the Treaty on European Union) is also the goal of the ÖDP. That is why the ÖDP in the European Parliament is committed to the goals described below.
1S.trengthening and expanding democracy
The ÖDP stands for a democratically organized European Union (EU) committed to cultural diversity as the basis for peace, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights in Europe. However, the fact that many citizens identify with the European Union at a distance and lack opportunities for co-determination jeopardizes these foundations. One reason for this is the considerable shortcomings in the current EU treaties. They mean that essential parts of democracy and social achievements are being abandoned. Above all, however, the European institutions (European Council, EU Parliament, Commission, Council of Ministers, etc.) suffer from a lack of democratic legitimacy and transparency.
Precisely because we are convinced of the European idea, we believe that a far-reaching reform of the European Union is urgently needed. This is the only way it can be stabilized and developed further.
Our goal is a European Union that respects and promotes the cultural and linguistic characteristics as well as the economic and social structures of the individual peoples and regions.
We support the development from a mere economic community to a confederation of free, primarily self-governing states and regions1 while respecting common European values.
Respect for human rights, the principles of a free and democratic constitutional state and an ecological and social market economy must be the decisive criteria both for the reform and internal development of the EU and for further EU memberships.

The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Abolition of the unanimity principle in the Council and introduction of majority decisions in all EU institutions (majority of nation states and the population).
 Introduction	of	binding	Europe-wide	referendums	and referendums.
 A uniform electoral law for the European Parliament - without blocking clauses.
 For the European Parliament, the fundamental rights of a democratically elected parliament:
 The right to formulate laws yourself instead of just voting on the EU Commission's proposals (right of initiative).
 The right to co-determine the EU's income and expenditure for the competences assigned to it.
 The right to propose and dismiss commissioners.
 The right to choose a single seat to end the shuttling between Strasbourg and Brussels and the waste of taxpayers' money.
 Control of the European Commission by the European Parliament.
 Limitation of EU competence: What can be sensibly regulated at local, regional or Member State level should not be transferred to the EU (principle of subsidiarity).
 European law may not worsen existing national law (social, ecological and democratic standards) in individual member states (prohibition of deterioration).
 Transparency through a comprehensive European right to freedom of information at all political levels.
 Easy-to-find, comprehensible and accessible provision of all EU documents that are not necessarily subject to confidentiality in all official EU languages on the Internet.
For sound national budgets
and a fair financial market order
The preservation of the natural foundations of life is the basis of all future prosperity. Social justice is the prerequisite for social peace. A good regulatory framework for the market economy enables people to develop economically and culturally. We are committed to an ecological and social market economy that deserves its name.
The current economic approach of overexploitation of nature accepts the destruction of our livelihoods. It decouples economic activities from their actual purpose: to serve life and the common good, i.e. to create a good life for all.
The global fight against global warming requires limiting the power of fossil fuel companies.
The misdirection caused by decoupled financial markets and lobbying in the EU is promoting the privatization of services of general interest, infrastructure and public services. They lead to ever more undemocratic transfers of power to the EU. We reject this development.
The ECB's purchase of government debt has reached over three trillion euros. The money supply has been greatly expanded. A sustainable financial order must be established in the EU. EU financial policy must also counter inflation.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Commercial and investment banks must be separated. Short selling must be banned. Ban on speculative transactions for lending commercial banks.
 There must be no more bank bailouts at state expense.
 The ECB program to purchase government bonds must be ended.
 The EU now continues to borrow via EU bonds2 , but has no tax revenue of its own. The ÖDP is therefore calling for EU taxes to be levied to finance these EU funds. Only states that levy EU taxes for this purpose should be entitled to receive these funds.
 The unanimity rule in tax matters in the EU Council is blocking progress in the fight against tax avoidance. It should be abolished in order to make the EU more capable of acting.
 A single currency requires a single financial policy in the eurozone. This requires democratic control by a democratically legitimized body made up of MEPs from the eurozone. To this end, these MEPs form a Euro Parliament. This elects one representative each for finance, economy, environment and social affairs from among its members. These four form a Senate, which has a right of proposal and veto on all issues relating to the eurozone. If the Council of Ministers fails to reach an agreement on issues relating exclusively to the eurozone, it is replaced by a 2/3 majority decision of the Euro Parliament on the proposal of the Senate. In this way, blockades by member states that do not belong to the eurozone can be resolved by means of a regulated procedure.
 EU-wide minimum tax rates for corporate profits and private income must be implemented consistently. Progressive income tax must be retained in the EU. It is the financial basis for financing the welfare state.
 Intra-European tax havens must be immediately and consistently
2 The EU fund "Recovery and Resilience Facility (ARF)" will be used by the EU to raise joint European bonds on the capital market. These joint EU debts are to be repaid by the member states from 2028 to 2058. To this end, they must draw up recovery and resilience plans (ARP plans). The "NextGenerationEU" (NGEU) financial assistance program will be financed from ARF funds.
to dry up. Profits should always be taxed in the countries in which they are generated. All companies in the EU must be encouraged to pay appropriate taxes.
 Corrupt companies must be excluded from public contracts.
 An EU financial transaction tax should be introduced in order to make the perpetrators of financial crises pay a share of the costs incurred.
 The CO2 border carbon adjustment tax (CBAM) serves to ensure fair competition between companies inside and outside the EU: imported products are put on an equal footing with production in the EU in terms of CO2 pricing. The scope of CBAM should be extended to include imported meat, for example. In addition, this border adjustment must be further expanded both in the assessment basis (full CO2 coverage or products produced with CO2 emissions) and in the tax rate. This tax rate must be continuously increased to such an extent that CO2 pricing within the EU can be adjusted to the level necessary to achieve the EU's climate protection targets. The CO2 border adjustment tax should also be used as a model for further raw material and emissions pricing (environmental taxes). The tax revenue from CBAM should be allocated to the importing member states. The member states themselves decide to what extent other levies are reduced in return (e.g. ancillary wage costs or the labor factor) and how much is given back to the citizens (eco-bonus).
Prosperity without the need for growth - Global responsibility
The ecological-social market economy sets clear priorities: We all live in this world and of this world, are part of the whole of this world with its nature and its climate. That is why the top priority must also be ecology - protecting nature and the environment and saving the climate.
We must stop the overexploitation of our natural resources. In an eco-social market economy, the costs of damage caused by environmental destruction and increasing climate extremes must also be included in the pricing of products. Then environmental destruction becomes uneconomical. Only cost transparency in this area creates fair competitive conditions for responsibly operating companies. Economical use of resources, repair and recycling must be worthwhile again. To this end, work should be gradually relieved of costs and the consumption of energy and raw materials made more expensive in return. The goal is a largely circular economy that makes do solely with the resources that the earth and sun provide each year.
We need more regionalization instead of an expansion of global trade in order to reduce transport costs and environmental pollution and to strengthen stability in crises. The goal is not isolationism, but trade that is geared towards social and ecological benefits. A regional supply of food and economic goods leads to sustainable economic activity, short distances, low traffic volumes and, at the same time, jobs close to home.
The gap between rich and poor shows the social contrasts in our society. However, the protests against the inequality of income and wealth do not lead to a sustainable regulatory policy, but rather to an economic policy that promotes the interests of capital investors and global investors.
of large corporations. Large parts of humanity must live in poverty and without hope. The lack of consideration for the environment and the climate will not only disrupt our livelihoods, but also lead to catastrophic shortages and social upheaval.
Environmental or social issues are usually treated as secondary. Society then usually has to pay for the damage. This contradicts the spirit of the common good. All economic activity must be geared towards the common good of all: Our goal is to reduce the ecological footprint of individuals, companies and states. We must not consume more than the resources this earth provides each year. The certification of as many institutions as possible according to the rules of the Economy for the Common Good is an important goal in order to demonstrate the comparability of compliance with ecological standards.
The ÖDP is committed to the ideas and goals of the post-growth economy and the principle that "less is more". The goal is prosperity that is not reduced to purely material values, but includes human values. We want to make a good life possible for everyone with less material effort, which is why the circular economy should be promoted.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Prioritizing the protection of the environment, the preservation of biodiversity and the implementation of the climate transition with the aim of achieving climate neutrality by 2030, as well as the effective monitoring of the necessary implementation steps to achieve this.
 A harmonization of employment, social and environmental standards in the EU. The ÖDP is calling for a public interest test to be carried out before a loan is granted.
 An adequate basic income for people throughout Europe,
who have no income of their own. For us, this includes children, parents, carers, those unable to work and, where applicable, pensioners. The amount of an adequate basic income must be aligned with the economic circumstances of the individual nation states.
 Companies that are particularly committed to the common good in social and ecological terms and respect human rights are to be promoted.
 Decentralized, small-scale structures should be promoted wherever it makes sense. This is why regionality must become a necessary basic requirement for public tenders in the EU.
 Trade agreements must not prevent municipalities and regions from specifically promoting local economic cycles, e.g. by awarding public contracts.
 Free trade agreements must become fair trade agreements that promote both biodiversity protection and minimum social standards. To this end, we need enforceable climate protection and sustainability clauses with sanctionable environmental, nature, animal and human rights standards. This must apply to agreements that are currently being negotiated, but also to those that have already been negotiated, such as CETA and TiSA. Free trade agreements must also be based on compliance with planetary boundaries. The European precautionary principle must not be weakened by these agreements. The establishment of private arbitration tribunals for the binding settlement of disputes between private investors and states favors large international corporations and their influence on legislation in the EU states. We therefore reject parallel justice through private arbitration courts implemented through trade agreements. The existing public courts are sufficient for the protection of investments. Negotiations on trade agreements must be conducted with maximum transparency and the involvement of civil society.
 We must move away from trade liberalization towards sustainable trade in raw materials. Economic interests in the extraction of raw materials must no longer be separated from social and ecological interests in the extraction of raw materials. The sustainable extraction of raw materials must be a prerequisite for trade in them and for investment in this trade. There must also be no one-sided orientation of economic policy towards the interests of EU industry; instead, local interests in developing countries, e.g. those of indigenous peoples, must also be taken into account. The EU's economic policy must pursue an integrative approach.
 European antitrust law must be strengthened and consistently enforced in order to prevent the concentration of economic power at the expense of the common good.
 Public services of general interest must be effectively protected from commercial exploitation interests. Access to clean water, healthy food, adequate housing, energy, communication, transportation, education, health and culture must not be impaired by trade agreements.
 Abolition of all environmentally and climate-damaging subsidies. Subsidies for harmful, environmentally damaging and water- intensive technologies must be ended.
 The EU emissions trading system and the carbon border tax (CBAM) are intended to encourage investment in low-emission technologies. European emissions trading is the core of EU climate protection policy in the energy sector. Full auctioning of emission
allowances enforces the polluter-pays principle and must be extended to other sectors. The revenues must flow into the transformation towards a climate-neutral society. Their revenues must not be used for fossil fuels or nuclear power plants (NPPs).
 EU industrial policy must massively promote the expansion of renewable energies and the development of a hydrogen economy with EU funds. No money should flow into the financing of nuclear power plants.
 The EU supply chain law must prescribe high ecological and social standards. The import of goods into the EU that violate these standards must be banned in principle and extended to all companies that are subject to financial reporting obligations. The burden of proof must lie with the company to prove whether it has acted responsibly or not.
 In addition to the import of raw materials, energy sources, textiles and food, financial products must also be included in this supply chain law. The international financial market has so far eluded direct control. Financial transactions on an OTC basis must be processed via futures exchanges and their transaction chain must be checked3 .
 For a fairer global distribution of prosperity, the EU should pay subsidies to regional social systems in the countries of the global South that support education and healthcare systems, the reduction of the ecological footprint and sustainable regional agriculture and reforestation (according to the Earth4All model).
 Ban on price-driving speculation with agricultural commodities. Effective control by a supervisory authority, which should also intervene preventively.
3 OTC trading: Large financial transactions are settled directly between banks within certain credit lines. 90 % of all derivatives are traded in this way. In exchange trading, on the other hand, collateral is required in line with the risk. On stock exchanges, prices are officially determined on a daily basis, which are used to calculate the transaction volume, profits and losses. This is not known for OTC transactions. h t t p s : / / d e . wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetare_Grenzen; shortly after this program was adopted, it was published that seven planetary boundaries had already been exceeded: https://www.nature.com/articles/ s41586-023-06083-8
Respecting planetary boundaries - protecting nature, climate and biodiversity
Land sealing, the destruction of natural habitats, the release of chemical substances into the environment and the burning of fossil fuels have not only destroyed many habitats of individual animals and plants, they also threaten the very existence of life on earth. Six planetary boundaries have been massively exceeded in some cases: (1) species extinction, (2) climate overheating, (3) environmental pollution with microplastics and others, (4) over- fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus, (5) deforestation, grassland conversion and sealing and
(6) Loss of soil moisture4 . This requires a comprehensive turnaround in the use of and pressure on natural resources. The economic, ecological and social aspects of sustainability must finally be given equal importance. The consideration of planetary boundaries, the protection of nature and biodiversity, soil, water, air and climate must be placed on the same level as economic development. The European Union must become a protective union for planet Earth.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Implementation of the resolutions of the UN World Conference on Nature (COP15).
 The goal of climate neutrality by 2030 by ending the use of fossil fuels and subsequently reducing the CO2 content of the atmosphere from the current 420 ppm to the safe level of 350
ppm using natural methods, in particular by consistently protecting and reactivating moors, forests and grassland, by building up humus and, if necessary, introducing biochar (Terra Preta) into arable soils, but without storing CO underground2 .

published	that	seven	planetary	boundaries	had	already	been	exceeded: https://www.nature.com/articles/ s41586-023-06083-8
 Recognition of nature as a legal entity in its own right and inclusion of the legal status of nature in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
 Creation of suitable legal forms for important parts of nature (forests, moors, rivers, etc.) analogous to the European corporate forms for companies, European Company (SE), European Cooperative Society (SCE) and European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), so that they can be represented in court.
 Consistent pursuit of all UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implementation of existing agreements and directives on environmental protection in the EU.
 Consistent enforcement of the polluter pays principle for environmental damage, international agreement on corporate responsibility towards nature and guaranteeing corporate liability for damage within the EU and also at international level.
 Observance and continuous improvement of the right to environmental complaints and information for citizens and civil society.
 Pricing of environmental use: In addition to the urgent expansion of CO2 pricing, the use of natural resources such as raw materials and land sealing etc. must be reduced by continuously increasing taxes until the prices of all products reflect the true economic, social and ecological costs.
 Better protection and precautions against hazardous chemicals (e.g. plasticizers in plastics or flame retardants in electrical appliances), rapid additions to the candidate list of particularly hazardous substances in accordance with the REACH regulation, replacement of substances on the Substitute It Now (SIN) list with substances that have been proven to be harmless and a ban on the export of hazardous chemicals.
 Access to clean and healthy water, securing groundwater recharge, groundwater and water protection: strengthening and consistent implementation of the Water Framework Directive, reconnection of floodplain areas, review of discharge permits into rivers and lakes and the planned expansion of rivers as transport routes, more use of grey water and closed water cycles, conversion of cities into
"Sponge towns". Minimize the impact on the water balance and prioritize local compensation. No industrial settlements in water protection areas.
 General ban on fracking, also ban on drilling in sensitive areas, except for municipal drinking water supplies and for heat pumps with a heat transfer medium that is not hazardous to water.
 Soil protection: an EU-wide law to protect the soil. Improvement of soil condition (around 70% of all European soils are in poor condition). An end to the dramatic consumption of land and the progressive sealing of land in Europe with its devastating ecological, urban, social and economic consequences. Obligation to prioritize the use of unused residential, commercial and transport areas in new construction projects. In the event that new land is urgently required, priority must be given to land- saving planning and development, appropriate building materials and construction methods must be used and genuine compensatory measures must be taken. A cap on land consumption in the EU by 2030 and net-zero land take for housing and transport in the EU well before 2050. Better information and training for those responsible at municipal and state level for better soil protection. Right to public participation in spatial planning procedures.
 Preventive flood protection: Retention of precipitation at the point of impact by unsealing soils, retention basins and designated flood zones.
 Marine protection: ending overfishing of the oceans, the discharge of (micro)plastics and toxic and radioactive substances and over-fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus. Research into suitable measures and their implementation to save and clean up the world's oceans.
 Nature and species protection: Expansion of the protected area landscape (including the designation of new nature conservation areas and national parks), protection of the last European primeval forests. Creation of management plans with conservation goals and measures for Natura 2000 protected areas. Expansion of the protection of endangered species and habitats. Gradual reduction in the use of pesticides in protected areas. Establishment of a functional biotope network system covering at least 15% of the terrestrial area of the member states by 2030. Elimination of enforcement deficits in nature conservation law and better funding and staffing of independent monitoring authorities.
 Moor protection: Protection of intact and professional rewetting of degraded moors with the aim of restoring peat-forming ecosystems as far as possible. Sustainable management of previously heavily drained peatland soils through peatland- preserving forms of management (e.g. paludiculture5 ). Stronger incentives for peatland protection through agricultural funding policy (CAP). Ban on ploughing up peatland, end peat extraction, restrict the import of peat-containing products and substrates and increase their substitution with more climate-friendly alternatives. Protection of near-natural peatland forests. Rewetting and sustainable management of peatlands used for forestry.
 Forest protection: Forcing forest conversion to near-natural habitats with site-appropriate tree communities over
5 Paludiculture (from the Latin palus "mire, swamp" and cultura "cultivation") is the agricultural and forestry use of wet moorland sites, e.g. by growing reeds for thatched roofs, cultivating plants to generate energy from biomass or peat mosses as a peat substitute for growing media in horticulture or by grazing water buffalo.
The forest should consist mainly of deciduous and mixed forests with a diverse native flora and fauna and a healthy, species-rich wildlife population. Promotion of soil- and stock-protecting forestry without chemical pesticides and liming. Establishment of healthy, stable and near-natural forests with alternating structurally rich commercial forest zones and management-free natural forest zones (such as primeval forests). Designation of at least 5% of the total forest area as wilderness areas. Protection, maintenance and creation of forest edges and fringes. Protection of unfragmented areas. Creation of green corridors, preservation of old trees and deadwood. Rewarding forest nature conservation measures. Promotion of agroforestry systems6 . Establishing and adequately equipping a European task force to fight large forest fires.
 Landscape protection: Establishment of hedges, copses and forest islands as ecological stepping stones, also in agricultural areas, through targeted support measures. Preservation and expansion of avenues and rows of trees along roads and country lanes, both inside and outside urban settlements. Promotion of new planting, gap planting and replanting, including through the establishment of a European cultural heritage fund, which also promotes the preservation of all other cultural-historical landscape elements.
6 Agroforestry refers to a (sometimes multi-storey) agricultural production system that combines elements of arable farming and animal husbandry with those of forestry.
Consistent animal welfare - animals are our fellow creatures
True humanity strives for the highest standards of animal welfare. This must become the maxim of European policy wherever animals are concerned: animals have rights and are not commodities! Unfortunately, the importance of animal welfare is low in many European countries. A change in awareness in dealing with our sentient fellow creatures is urgently needed.
Decades of misguided EU subsidy policies have led to the ongoing industrialization of animal husbandry. A focus on growth and the global market as well as statutory minimum standards in livestock farming, which are not based on the needs of the animals, cause millions of systematic animal suffering in European stables. Transporting animals for slaughter for far too long within the EU, a lack of or non-existent control capacities and a completely inadequate infrastructure to unload, feed and house the animals in a barn after transportation cause even more animal suffering on the way to the slaughterhouse. When animals are transported to third countries in the EU, the idea of animal welfare degenerates into a farce.
But sentient beings also suffer every day in research and teaching, in hunting, in circuses and in the keeping of pets and exotic animals, as well as in the trade in animals. Also because the EU fails to act or acts inadequately. This must change!
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Safeguarding animal rights in accordance with the EU Treaty.
 Better enforcement and control of compliance with animal welfare in accordance with EU legislation.
 Appointment of an independent EU Commissioner for Animal Welfare: The concept of animal welfare must become a recognized part of the cultural and legal order of a united Europe.
 Creation of an EU Animal Welfare Commission, consisting of several representatives from each member state, with the participation of recognized animal welfare associations, to uncover and prevent cruelty to animals, which also acts in an advisory capacity in relevant legislative projects.
 Introduction of a Europe-wide right of action for recognized animal welfare associations.
 Prohibition of forms of husbandry that lead to animals suffering avoidable stress, pain and resulting diseases. Species- appropriate and behaviorally appropriate husbandry and feeding as a maxim in all EU husbandry regulations and in the common agricultural policy.
 Immediate ban on chick shredding, castration without anaesthesia and dehorning of calves without anaesthesia. No invasive procedures (e.g. beak trimming, tail docking) without medical indication in individual cases.
 Introduction of mandatory farming labeling (husbandry, transport, slaughter) for all foods of animal origin, which also applies to ingredients of animal origin in processed products.
 Ban on the trade and sale of agricultural products whose production violates applicable EU law or for which there is no farming label.
 Immediate abolition of all EU subsidies for animal transportation!
 No transport of animals for slaughter within the EU over 100 kilometers.
 Protecting small, regional abattoirs and butchers from over- regulation by the EU.
 Facilitate on-site slaughter (e.g. home slaughter, pasture slaughter with mobile slaughter box, "slaughter with care").
 No live transportation of animals for slaughter or breeding to countries outside the EU as long as compliance with the applicable EU minimum standards is not fully guaranteed there.
Promotion
z. e.g. the establishment of stud books for local livestock breeds as part of development cooperation.
 Prohibition of torturous breeding of animals (e.g. extremely short-nosed dog breeds, hairless cats) similar to the corresponding ban in the Netherlands. Animal welfare must also be given more weight in the breeding of increasingly "efficient" farm animals.
 Ban on animal husbandry for fur production and import as well as a trade ban on furs and fur products.
 Ban on the keeping, training and performance of wild animals in circuses!
 Prohibition of trade in live animals via the internet or social media. Simplification of communication between member states in the event of cross-border infringements, particularly in the case of trade in dogs, cats, pets and exotic animals.
 Introduction of EU-wide compatible and mandatory systems for the identification and registration of pets for better traceability and definition of an EU-wide positive list for the trade and keeping of exotic pets.
 Promoting the preservation, use and breeding of old livestock breeds threatened with extinction, also to safeguard genetic diversity.
 EU import ban on hunting trophies and a clear no to trophy hunting and trade.
 Europe-wide ban on hunts.
 EU-wide ban on cruel hunting methods (trapping, den hunting, bow hunting, etc.).
 No hunting of endangered species (Red List from early warning level).
 Ban on the hunting of all songbirds.
 Prohibition of hunting dog training in so-called "Schliefenanlagen" and artificial tunnels.
 Better control over earmarked EU funds for stray animals such as street dogs instead of illegal, painful killing.
 Intensive promotion of animal-free research and teaching methods and the establishment of a corresponding European chair. We need a phase-out plan - for an EU without animal testing!
 Ban on genetic manipulation of animals.
Agriculture and forestry are
Within just a few decades, agriculture has been transformed from a rural circular economy into an industrial production of raw materials for the food industry and energy production. The EU's subsidy, free trade and competition policy was and is based on the dogma of "grow or die". Instead of giving unrestricted priority to supplying its own population, production for the global market is still praised as the way out of the dumping price trap. Increasing dependence on subsidies, on the chemical industry and on imports of oil and animal feed makes our food supply vulnerable to crises and disruptions. In addition, the distribution of EU subsidies mainly benefits large, intensively operating farms. 4/5 of all money goes to 1/5 of the farms, while smaller family farms fall by the wayside. In the last 20 years, the number of farms nationwide has fallen by almost 50 %.
As an extremely negative consequence of this development, land grabbing is continuing in Europe and all over the world. International agricultural corporations, banks, pension funds, foundations and other non-agricultural investors are securing huge areas of agricultural land as profitable investments. This means that these areas are lost to family farms. In addition, unchecked land consumption due to transportation, commercial and housing projects as well as competition for energy crop production for biogas are driving up lease prices.
Pesticides, nitrogen over-fertilization and industrialized farming methods have also brought us to the brink of a dramatic catastrophe in Europe: we are in the midst of the greatest extinction of species since the extinction of the dinosaurs! The losses of mammals, birds, insects and plants are particularly disastrous in open agricultural areas. The EU biodiversity
strategy is not consistently implemented and requirements are often insufficiently reviewed.
Numerous studies show that organic farming is positive in all socially important areas (climate protection, preservation of soil fertility, drinking water protection, protection of biodiversity, animal welfare, etc.). 7 Its expansion must be a priority.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Consistent reorientation of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) towards services for the common good in agriculture (climate protection, preservation of biodiversity, water protection, animal welfare, etc.): Public money only for public services!
 Subsidies must be tied to simple but effective ecological and social standards. Abolish flat-rate land subsidies!
 Payments should be qualified on an individual farm basis using points systems based on easily recorded farm data: Farms with a higher proportion of grassland, more biotope areas, soil-based animal husbandry, small fields, more diverse crop rotations and higher CO2 sequestration through field hedges, hu- bocks and the introduction of certified biochar8 into soils must receive higher support than farms that do not make this additional effort and rely on rationalization and minimum standards.
 All political decisions must be based on the findings of the World Agriculture Report: Stable, regional and internal economic cycles instead of global market orientation and the pressure to grow! Security of food supply can
7 For example Prof. Dr. K.-J. Hülsbergen, H. Schmid, Dr. L. Chmelikova, Prof. Dr. G. Rahmann,

8 For example with European biochar certificate, https://www.european-biochar.org/de/
can only be achieved through agriculture that is as independent as possible from supply chains, feed and fertilizer imports.
 Promotion of model projects, e.g. organic farming close to the city for urban self-sufficiency.
 Stop importing animal feed and agricultural and animal products that have been produced in an environmentally damaging and unsocial way. Fair trade instead of free trade!
 Stop land grabbing and the sale of agricultural land to people and companies with no connection to agriculture.
 Gradually end subsidies for all agrofuels by 2030! No more burning food in the tank!
 More money for research in organic farming! At least 30% of EU research funding in the field of agriculture should be made available for organic farming.
 Improvement and expansion of advisory services for conversion and organic farms, especially in the areas of marketing, marketing and processing as well as in the food trade. We call for a premium and support for food businesses that want to convert to organic production.
 All public institutions are obliged to purchase at least 30 % of their food from regional organic farms.
 The basics of organic farming must be taught in all "green professions" as equal training content alongside conventional teaching content.
 Ban glyphosate and all total herbicides, halve the total use of pesticides.
 Fundamental reform of the system of risk assessment, approval and control of pesticides. The results of water monitoring must be included in the risk assessment for substance approvals.
 Export ban on pesticides banned in the EU.
 Ensuring greater water protection in accordance with the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).
 Subsidy programs for underground drip irrigation to save water.
 Establishment of support programs for rooftop greenhouses and the use of aquaponics for fish farming.
 Livestock numbers are to be reduced to environmentally acceptable levels (max. 2 livestock units/ha, e.g. 2 adult cattle/hectare). New livestock buildings or conversion measures are only to be promoted if this target is not exceeded. In order to achieve the Paris climate targets, livestock numbers in the EU must be halved by 2045.
 The welfare of farm animals must be given priority in the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy: Improving husbandry conditions for our fellow creatures! Better husbandry conditions also mean less use of antibiotics to protect humans, animals and the environment!
 Better promotion of pasture animal husbandry.
 Top priority for soil protection: limiting land consumption as far as possible and promoting the build-up of humus to store CO2 and maintain soil fertility.
 Greater preservation and development of forests as important CO2 sinks and water reservoirs against climate extremes and
torrential rain. Supporting programs for mini-forests (Tiny Forests) in regions threatened by drought.
 No deregulation of the Genetic Engineering Act! Consistent ban on the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the EU. This must also apply to CRISPR/Cas and other new biotech methods. Imported products that are produced with GMOs
or contain them must be clearly and comprehensibly labeled.
 No patents on life!
Consumer protection affects all areas of life
As one of the largest internal markets in the world, the EU has a broad body of legislation that regulates the free movement of goods, services and capital. The rights of consumers in this business-dominated market are still not sufficiently defined. Issues such as the right to ecological and natural products, the right to repair in conjunction with the ban on planned obsolescence9 have no EU-wide legal basis to date. Contaminated food and genetically modified plants still have free access to the market in the EU. Consumer protection is now a European task and affects all areas of life: Food production, information about goods and services, internet trade and electronic payment transactions, travel contract law, energy sources, social media and even mobile communications.
The ÖDP is calling for this in particular at EU level:
 General obligation to apply the precautionary principle, especially where human health is concerned.
 Product labeling requirement for ingredients of all food, personal care and cosmetic products: detailed, easy to read (organic label clearly visible), comprehensible and with information on the manufacturer, the place of production and the preliminary products and animal ingredients used.
 Ban on the cultivation, breeding and import of genetically modified plants, animals and food, including those modified using gene scissors (CRISPR/Cas). Necessary amendment of affected free trade agreements. Until the ban is implemented
9 Obsolescence: the ageing of a product [inherent in its production method, materials or similar], which renders it obsolete or unusable.
All products made from genetically modified material must be clearly labeled, especially for allergy sufferers.
 Prohibition of advertising for alcohol, tobacco and other addictive substances as well as for all foods that are harmful to health and contain too much added sugar and sugar substitutes, salt or inferior fats. Prohibition of advertising for unhealthy foods, especially for children and young people. Obligation to clearly label foodstuffs, stating all additives, flavorings and auxiliary substances.
 Obligation to use food packaging, other food contact materials and tableware that are harmless to health through clear bans on particularly harmful substances. Removal of potentially harmful products from the market and introduction of a European authorization procedure. Strengthening the monitoring of regulations and law enforcement.
 Mandatory labeling of animal products so that consumers can make conscious purchasing decisions for greater animal welfare. Introduction of a uniform and mandatory animal welfare label! Mandatory consumer information on the use of pesticides, antibiotics and genetic engineering using clear images of animal husbandry.
 Obligation to introduce a uniform EU consumer-friendly contract law, EU-wide right of action for consumer associations, authorization of class actions and introduction of a European degree course in "Sustainability".
 Right to repair products in conjunction with a ban on planned obsolescence. Obligation to provide software updates for at least ten years.
 Prohibition of all substances of very high concern, in particular those with carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotogenic or toxic effects.
and endocrine disrupting properties10 and a ban on hazardous substances and substance groups11 , especially for the protection of children and young people. Revise the EU Chemicals Regulation (REACH) accordingly as quickly as possible.
 No reintroduction of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the economic cycle via recycling. Clear labeling of these carcinogenic, hazardous chemicals, especially in textiles, everyday objects and packaging, until the ban is implemented. The same requirements for the health safety of recycled materials as for newly produced materials.
 Ban on "fast fashion" and other short-lived phenomena. Binding requirements for the ecological sustainability of textiles and other products, ecological efficiency along the entire value chain, a genuine circular economy that focuses on minimizing waste and conserving resources, the elimination of harmful substances and microplastics, good working conditions and enabling consumers to make clear purchasing decisions through transparent labelling in the form of a digital and analogue product passport and a ban on returns.
 Facilitating reuse and recycling and minimizing the amount of residual waste through better product design, especially of composite materials, and uniform waste separation systems in the EU. Stronger waste prevention quotas that reflect the waste hierarchy, i.e. prioritizing prevention and reuse over recycling. Ban on waste exports, especially to countries in the Global South. The export of non-hazardous waste for further use should only be permitted to countries that can treat waste sustainably.

 As a result of the NSA affair, a system guarantee is needed for the confidential and secure transmission of data with complete digital sovereignty. No pressure on consumers to permanently buy the latest products, such as smartphones, in order not to be excluded from participation.
 Reduction of radiation limits for mobile phone transmitters, smartphones and other radio systems to recognized precautionary limits. Mandatory labeling of the radiation intensity of all devices and transmitters.
 Establish low-radio areas in public buildings, hospitals and means of transportation. Minimize radio interference in nature conservation areas. Ensuring and maintaining low-radio areas as a habitat for radio-sensitive people (minimal radio radiation is sufficient for transmitting calls).
 Preservation of cash payment options and radio-independent use of ATMs, public transport and long-distance transport (right to analog life and data protection). Promotion of healthier alternatives to radio transmission for radio-sensitive people, e.g. through optical transmission technologies such as Li-Fi.12
 Retention of people's decision-making sovereignty and autonomy, i.e. no ethical or political decisions by algorithms/artificial intelligence.

8. Making mobility environmentally friendly
The ÖDP stands for a comprehensive ecological mobility turnaround. This is more than just replacing conventional means of transport with more ecological ones. It includes decentralization through better urban and spatial planning, traffic avoidance, modal shift, networking of different transport options and more ecological drive concepts. The primary goal of the ÖDP is mobility with as little traffic as possible. Mobility must be rethought in terms of health, social compatibility and ecology and made "suitable for grandchildren". In particular, the proportion of car traffic must be reduced in favor of low-emission, climate-friendly and resource- conserving alternatives such as walking, cycling and public transport. We don't need car-friendly cities, we need people-friendly cities as well as good cycle paths and public transport connections in both rural and urban areas.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 A mobility deal for an ecological mobility and transport turnaround with ambitious goals:
 Reduction of the passenger car fleet to 150 million vehicles with significantly reduced average size as well as resource and fleet energy consumption by 2035.
 Attractive ecological rail and ferry connections as alternatives to individual motorized transport and short-haul flights of up to 1,000 kilometers.
 Large-scale shift of interregional road freight transport to rail and waterways by 2035.
 100% renewable energy for mobility by 2030 and development of the necessary infrastructure: charging facilities for battery-electric vehicles and refueling facilities for vehicles that use synthetic fuels based on renewable hydrogen.
 Restricting the use of synthetic fuels to heavy goods traffic, necessary air and shipping traffic, etc., where direct electrification is difficult to achieve.
 Extraction of the required raw materials and production of the infrastructure and vehicles in the EU as completely as possible. Imports from third countries only in strict compliance with human rights and social and environmental standards.
 Comprehensive promotion of traffic avoidance and traffic reduction as well as ecologically advantageous mobility options such as walking, cycling, local public transport and rail transport and better networking and utilization of different means of transport, for example through car sharing, especially in rural areas.
 Regulation of the burden of all modes of transport through taxes, levies and charges so that their actual costs, environmental burdens and consequential damage are taken into account, in particular the burden on motorized private transport in terms of energy, resource and land consumption as well as greenhouse gas, pollutant and noise emissions with corresponding relief for ecologically advantageous mobility options.
 End European subsidies for road construction (e.g. through structural funds). No subsidies for autonomous motorized private transport, air cabs and any form of mobility where broad social participation is not foreseeable.
 Taxation of air traffic. A fundamental ban on short-haul flights of less than 1,000 km and a ban on take-offs and landings from 8
p.m. to 6 a.m. No subsidies for the construction and expansion of airports.
 Specifications for speed limits in the member states: 120 km/h on freeways, 80 km/h outside built-up areas and 30 km/h in built-up areas with the exception of suitable main roads.
Comprehensive energy and
Our ectounronmayrois uhneadvily dependent on energy and resources, the production and use of which have a massive impact on our environment. The need for growth has led to a sharp increase in the demand for critical raw materials. The increased extraction and consumption of raw materials is exacerbating global environmental problems such as soil degradation and the increasing loss of biodiversity worldwide. The goal of the ÖDP is the economical use of energy and resources, a complete switch to renewable energies in harmony with the protection of local residents, species, nature and the landscape by 2030, an end to the constant growth of consumption and consumption as well as a move away from the throwaway society and the establishment of a genuine circular economy.
Less is more! It's not just about replacing fossil and nuclear energies with renewable ones, it's not just about ecological production. Through a better spatial connection of work, local supply, leisure and living over short distances; through a comprehensive mobility turnaround with priority for walking, cycling and public transport; through housing offers that can be adapted to changing needs with a high proportion of communally used spaces; through communal use, rental and exchange of vehicles, tools, etc.; through repair-friendly, durable and preferably made from renewable raw materials.Through repair-friendly, durable products, preferably made from renewable raw materials; through an intelligent mix of different renewable energies and through communal energy concepts at neighborhood level, the ÖDP aims to ensure that significantly less energy is required than today, that fewer resources are needed to provide it and that less land is used. When energy is used, it should be used efficiently: through a circular economy, energy-efficient buildings, electric instead of combustion engines and energy-efficient appliances.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Clear, ambitious targets: 100 % energy supply from renewable, predominantly European sources by 2030. Establishment of the fullest possible production of the necessary components and systems in the EU, from the extraction of raw materials to the operational system.
 No greenwashing of environmentally destructive and dangerous forms of energy. No more misleading classifications: Only energies that are constantly available or regenerate within a short period of time through natural cycles such as plant growth are to be considered renewable energies. Nuclear power, fossil fuels, including natural gas, as well as unsustainably sourced biomass, peat and non-recyclable waste and residues produced from fossil fuels are not renewable energies.
 Ban on the import of energy, raw materials, components and equipment from countries with human rights violations. Obligation of companies to comply with human rights, social and environmental standards along their entire supply chain. No raw material extraction in sensitive ecosystems, nature reserves or in the deep sea.
 No support for the construction, expansion or maintenance of fossil fuel infrastructure such as liquefied natural gas terminals. End the extraction and import of fossil resources by 2030 at the latest.
 Obligation to take out liability insurance for nuclear power plants still in operation throughout Europe, which also provides financial cover for regular waste disposal and the consequences of a possible reactor disaster.
 Termination of the Euratom Treaty, immediate EU-wide phase- out and replacement by a Renewable Energy Treaty to switch to a global renewable energy supply
in harmony with environmental and species protection and in compliance with human rights and social standards.
 Promoting the conversion of energy supply structures to decentralized units that use only renewable energies and are owned by citizens, farmers, small and medium-sized enterprises and municipalities wherever possible.
 Ensuring the resilience of the energy supply through decentralized generation and storage: In the event of natural disasters, cyber attacks and military action, a basic supply must be guaranteed at the level of cities and rural districts without an external energy supply for a period of several weeks.
 Consistent development of a circular economy that conserves energy and resources. Ban on plastic waste and electronic waste exports.
 Extension of the Ecodesign Directive to all product groups.
 Adaptation of the EU framework for taxation in the Member States to favor repair, reuse, sharing, rental and a sharing economy.
 Introduction of a European right to repair: Obligation for manufacturers of technical devices to offer long-term replacement parts and publish repair instructions. Manufacturers must be subject to a take-back obligation that ensures recycling.
 Obligation of manufacturers and providers of goods and services to declare the energy and resource consumption in the manufacture of products in a way that allows consumers to inform themselves easily and without effort.
 Prohibition of planned obsolescence and introduction of an effective control system.
Minimum standards in social
The EU as a union of states with common European values must also be further developed in the social sphere beyond a neoliberal free trade area. In fact, many EU countries lack a balanced distribution of responsibilities between the sexes in politics and society, in business and families and, above all, adequate pay, especially for jobs performed by women. There are also widespread attempts by politicians to patronize or discriminate against people in their choice of life or family model.
The social systems, which have developed differently from country to country, remain primarily the responsibility of the member states, although convergence should be sought. Care must be taken to ensure that each social system is also functional within each country.
The ÖDP is calling for this at EU level:
 Minimum social standards that fulfill the goals and values of the EU and are binding for all member states.
 Strengthening families through a commitment to an appropriate state equalization of burdens and benefits.
 Intergenerational fairness through equal public benefits for youth protection on the one hand and old-age provision on the other in every EU country.
 Improving the possibilities of reconciling family and career through family-friendly and family-friendly guidelines for employers and legislation.
 Targeted efforts to ensure the equal value of family and professional child-rearing and care work through equal remuneration - necessary if the work performed in the family is to be rewarded equally.
The aim is for the work performed to benefit not only the parents but also the general public via a pay-as-you-go system.
 Guaranteeing social security and participation through security systems for times and situations in life when security is vital.
 Financing of social services and public tasks by citizens according to their economic capacity.
 Monitoring and improving the protection of the rights of children, young people and parents.
 Progress in combating child poverty, which is always also parental poverty and therefore family poverty, through a balanced social system.
 Committed fight against the gender pay gap by equalizing wages for the care work predominantly performed by women inside and outside the family compared to other paid work.
 Targeted measures for more gender equality and programs for gender equality in public and academic areas.
 Long-term funding programs for social and gender research in the medical field.
 Targeted combating of forced prostitution, human trafficking and exploitation of any kind.
 No paternalism or discrimination in the choice of life and family model.
Education for all areas of life
As a pro-European party, the ÖDP clearly supports the basic idea of a "European Education Area"13 and a "European Higher Education Area"14 . The European Union sets the framework for national education systems. Clear effects of this in Germany were the changeover from Diplom degree courses to Bachelor's/Master's degree courses as part of the so-called "Bologna reform"15 and the ERASMUS program.
For the ÖDP, education is more than the acquisition of skills and knowledge. Education policy must not be geared towards pure usability. Demands that treat people merely as "tools" or
The ÖDP clearly rejects the idea of education as a "resource" for the economy. Education also serves the development of the personality and the active shaping of one's own life. To this end, the critical questioning of social conditions and structures, the ability to help shape society in a sustainable way and an understanding of nature as the basis of life are fundamentally important components of education as understood by the ÖDP - as are the values of tolerance, fairness, respect and helpfulness.
Democracy thrives on such education. Being political, thinking, participating and thus living democracy in everyday life is an attitude - teaching and promoting this is the necessary duty of educational institutions. If we as a European society want to be and remain crisis-proof, we need responsible citizens with this attitude who say yes to democracy and yes to the European Union.

(20.05.2023)
The ÖDP's understanding of education expressly does not exclude the practical orientation of educational measures. Rather, the aim must be to dovetail practice and critical reflection. Particularly in the area of vocational qualification, training measures should be geared towards the specific occupational requirements. At the same time, working conditions and the economic and political framework conditions affecting them must always be scrutinized. Even in the so-called "general education" system, life references should - where possible - be established in order to develop concrete skills. The ÖDP advocates progressive approaches in this area that break down the traditional divide between education and practice.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Implementation of the human right to education, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Art. 26),
i.e. orientation of education policy towards the full development of people.
 It must be possible for everyone to continue their education and personal development even at an advanced age.
 Introduction of a different understanding of "lifelong learning" at EU level and corresponding adaptation of EU treaties. It should no longer just be about adapting to technology and market requirements, but about the opportunity for personal development.
 Financial aspects must not be an obstacle to participation in educational measures.
 The European Commission's "skilled workers on demand"16 approach for universities must be ended immediately.
16 The European Commission is calling for universities to be restructured in such a way that they produce the graduates that the economy needs. Students' personal educational a s p i r a t i o n s do not play a role in this.
 Promotion of practice-oriented approaches both in the so-called "general education" system and in the area of vocational education and training.
 The European Qualifications Framework and the classifications of the national qualifications frameworks must be further developed so that the basis for classification is no longer educational certificates but actual knowledge, skills and competences.
 The European Qualifications Framework for the comparability of European qualifications needs to be more differentiated overall in order to adequately reflect qualifications.
 Project funding for the introduction of educational measures that promote and increase people's awareness of the interrelationships and mechanisms of action in nature.
 Organize competitions for educational institutions that focus on the sensitivity of nature.
 Expansion of educational measures aimed at respecting and upholding human rights and democratic values.
 Promotion of didactic approaches to political education and democracy education and networking of the educational institutions supported.
 Promotion of innovative educational institutions that focus more strongly on musical, artistic, sports and humanities education in their didactic approaches.
 Strengthening extracurricular education (e.g. clubs, youth associations).
 Generally launching programs to support the financially disadvantaged to participate in educational measures.
Work
The extremely different living conditions within the EU and worldwide have led to labor migration. This has a whole range of negative consequences such as wage dumping and undeclared work, growing competition in the low-wage sector and for affordable housing, ghettoization and social imbalances - even within the EU member states. Cross-border labor migration often deprives the countries of origin of important skilled workers trained there. To avoid these negative consequences, both the world of work and labor migration need clear framework conditions. European legislation on migration should focus in particular on comparatively motivated and adaptable workers.
To date, the EU has been involved in the negotiations on TiSA within the framework of the WTO. Everything known so far from the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) violates the values of the EU. For example, workers coming from non-EU countries are to be paid and treated according to the country of posting, not according to the social and labor regulations of the EU country in which the service is provided.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 The immediate withdrawal of the EU from the TiSA negotiations.
 For the world of work:
 Principle of "equal pay for work of equal value" instead of "equal pay for equal work".
 Enforcement of the right to form trade unions and protection and expansion of employees' co-determination rights.
 Legal guarantee of living wages for all workers.
 Right to (paid) further training for employees.
 Expansion of exchange programs for young people such as Erasmus+.
 EU-wide maternity protection regulations: Extension of the minimum period of maternity protection to 18 weeks, including at least two weeks before delivery.
 Continued payment of 100% of the salary subject to social insurance contributions during maternity protection.
 Adapting occupational health and safety to the challenges of a changing world of work.
 Protection of whistleblowers in companies.
 For labor migration from EU countries:
 Narrow interpretation of the work contract regulation so that it can no longer be used to circumvent employment subject to social security contributions.
 Compliance with the environmental, social and employment standards (including minimum wage) of the member state in which the service is provided.
 For labor migration from non-EU countries:
 The creation of a uniform European immigration law that offers fair opportunities for legal immigration into the EU, but does not lead to an excessive exodus of well-qualified skilled workers from the countries of origin.
 Minimum protection of employee rights in accordance with the core labor standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO).
 Creation of a social security system that is comparable in all EU member states, taking into account national circumstances.
 Practice-oriented training in which attention is paid to professional and linguistic qualifications and cultural integration. Conveying the guiding principle of the European idea and commitment to the common good.
 A probationary period with regard to the residence permit, which serves the purpose of probation and prevents the pursuit of social benefits. Application of the "demand and encourage" principle.
Combating the causes of flight - humane asylum and refugee policy
Flight and migration - especially to neighboring countries - have many causes: Wars and civil wars, often involving the use of German weapons, persecution on religious grounds, mismanagement and corruption and the consequences of free trade agreements and the way of life and economy of industrialized nations. Increasingly, climate change is one of the causes or the main cause of flight and migration. As refugees are usually denied normal travel options, they often fall into the clutches of organized traffickers and attempt to reach Europe at the risk of life and limb.
We are partly responsible for many of the causes of flight. The current policy of the EU and its member states does too little overall to address them: promoting just structures, respect for human rights and good governance in the world, fair trade relations, peaceful resolution of conflicts and the fight against climate change and its consequences. This leads to hunger, unbearable hardship, oppression and conflict and, as a result, to flight and displacement.
Granting asylum and implementing the Geneva Convention on Refugees is our duty and an indispensable act of humanity. Europe cannot take in all refugees, but we reject the idea of sealing ourselves off in a "Fortress Europe". The Dublin procedure places an excessive burden on member states at the EU's external borders and the preferred destination countries in the center and north of Europe, pushing them to the limits of what is possible or desirable.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 A common European asylum law.
 Eliminating the causes of flight:
 Conversion of all trade contracts into fair trade contracts.
 Helping people to help themselves and supporting reparation and reconciliation processes in crisis regions.
 Economical and efficient use of raw materials.
 No arms exports outside the EU and NATO, unless a country is defending itself against an attack in violation of international law.
 Humane treatment of refugees at the EU's external borders and in the host countries and more consistent monitoring of compliance with human rights by the European border and coast guard agency Frontex.
 Fair distribution of refugees or financial compensation according to the population and economic capacity of the EU member states. Abolition of the unfair distribution of refugees, as is currently carried out by means of the "third country regulation" of the Dublin Agreement.
 Creating opportunities to apply for asylum in the EU outside the borders of EU states.
 Combating human trafficking by opening up safe and legal escape routes.
 Residence permit on humanitarian grounds for quota refugees until return to their home country is possible.
 Expansion of the organized admission of particularly vulnerable refugees recognized by the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR who can neither return to their home country nor remain in their first country of refuge (resettlement programmes).
 More financial aid for refugee camps outside the EU.
 Recognition of climate refugees.
 Creation or expansion of permanent prospects for rejected asylum seekers in their home countries.
 Securing funding for the UNHCR and the World Food Program (WFP).
Life protection and bioethics
Human dignity is inviolable, regardless of the stage of life, physical and mental health and state of consciousness. An elementary expression of this dignity is the right to life of every human being, from conception to death, as well as the principle that human beings must never be regarded as objects and under aspects of use or commercialization.
The inviolability of human dignity and the right to life are increasingly being questioned and threatened, especially at the beginning and end of life. The ÖDP is committed to upholding these fundamental rights. Prenatal and pre-implantation diagnostics must not be used to select and kill people.
The ÖDP consistently opposes any commercialization that violates human dignity. This includes surrogate motherhood, which disregards the relationship between mother and child during pregnancy and its importance for the child's further development, as well as commercial organ donations, which open the door to the abuse of people as spare parts stores for organs.
The ÖDP is opposed to the right to direct active euthanasia, as this entails the risk of pressure being exerted on the elderly and seriously ill or their relatives to consent to euthanasia, especially if palliative care cannot be guaranteed due to a lack of care facilities or financial resources.
Genetic engineering, cloning and research on and with e m b r y o s raise further ethical questions. New findings in research and medical practice as well as social change must be considered in the light of fundamental values, above all human dignity.
and must be discussed comprehensively in society. This is often done inadequately and too late.
Modern biochemical techniques such as CRISPR/Cas make it possible to easily modify the genetic make-up of living organisms. Although they offer enormous potential for research, biotechnology and medicine, they also open up opportunities for misuse, such as the optimization of human embryos. The ÖDP opposes this.
Genetic modifications of germline cells are hereditary and cannot be reversed if genetically modified organisms are released into the environment. That is why the ÖDP rejects the release of any kind of genetically modified organisms.
The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Creation of child- and family-friendly structures in social services, the economy and the world of work as well as the provision of comprehensive support for pregnant women in conflict situations, so that a yes to the child is made possible and supported and the number of abortions is reduced.
 Consistent implementation and further development of the EU strategy in favor of people with disabilities, especially with regard to comprehensive support for parents who are expecting a child with a probable disability or who have a child with a disability.
 Programs for the EU-wide adoption of children from emergency situations, e.g. those conceived by women raped in war zones, as well as medical, psychological and material support for women in emergency situations during pregnancy and after birth.
 Prohibition of surrogacy and the associated physical and psychological exploitation of women.
 No selection of embryos, for example through prenatal and pre- implantation diagnostics.
 Comprehensive embryo protection. A ban on the production and import of human embryonic cell lines.
 Ban on human cloning and genetic enhancement17 as well as genetic engineering interventions in the human germline.
 No obligation to donate organs in member states and ban on organ trafficking.
 Directive on the needs-based expansion of palliative care and corresponding financing of hospice units and
-services.
 No patenting of genetic material. Genetic diversity is a common good.
 Restricting the use of genetic engineering methods, taking into account strict ethical criteria and possible risks to humans and the environment.

Civil rights, data protection and internal security
in digital progress
As a society and, above all, as human beings, we are facing a multitude of challenges as digitalization progresses with its diverse communication and data processing possibilities, especially when it comes to safeguarding our civil rights, protecting our personal data and maintaining internal security. In this development, the ÖDP is committed to future-oriented digitalization: It wants to use and promote the potential of digital solutions, but at the same time protect the rights and interests of all citizens from the numerous encroachments of profit- and power-hungry Internet players and support digital projects that have a lasting positive effect on our living space and the common good. The ÖDP also represents the guidelines set out by the German Ethics Council on digitalization.18
Strengthening citizens' rights in the EU
People in the EU often benefit from the civil rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights: personal, civil, political, economic and social rights, protection against discrimination and protection of personal data. We sometimes lose sight of the latter when, in our enthusiasm for technology and the many possibilities it offers, we agree to all cookies and terms and conditions with a quick click in order to "be part of it". For the benefit of the big data professionals.
18 Publications: "Man and Machine - Challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence" 2022 (https://www.ethikrat.org/fileadmin/Publikationen/Stellungnahmen/deutsch/stellungnahme-mensch-
-und-maschine.pdf); "Big Data und Gesundheit - Datensouveränität als informationelle Freiheitsge- staltung" 2017 (https://www.ethikrat.org/fileadmin/Publikationen/Studien/befragung-big-data-und- gesundheit.pdf); "Pflege - Roboter - Ethik: Eine spannungsvolle Beziehung" 2019 (https://www.ethikrat.org/fileadmin/user_upload/infobrief-02-19-web.pdf).
With its basic program, the ÖDP advocates the protection of the individual and their basic rights, whether analog or digital. That is why it demands:
 Further strengthening and enforcement of EU fundamental rights in all EU member states, particularly in the digital sector through compliance with data protection (GDPR19 ) and its consistent enforcement.
 A Europe-wide action plan that opposes all forms of discrimination and violence, such as racism and queer hostility, and promotes cooperative coexistence.
 Avoiding the compulsion to use automated systems (e.g. online systems of public authorities, cashless payment) by retaining traditional, analog means of exercising their civic rights and duties (digital sovereignty ).20
 Safeguarding media and press freedom, in particular investigative journalism.
 A comprehensive EU whistleblower protection program.
 Disclosure and thus verifiability of the algorithms that make a selection or decision instead of a human being.
 The promotion of technical facilities to support individual freedoms in mobility, communication, education, generally accessible open source databases and program systems, etc.
 Determining the compatibility of new communication technologies with data protection prior to their approval or introduction

and the other EU regulations by democratically legitimized bodies.
 New regulations on the handling of personal medical data, which must not lead to a deterioration in healthcare provision.
 Protection and promotion of access to education, fair working conditions and social participation.
More consistent data protection as an urgent task for the EU
Digital communication systems (internet) offer us many advantages in everyday life, but are also highly associated with the risk of data misuse, which is why the EU has created a strict set of rules to prevent this with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with the rights to information, erasure, objection, rectification, restricted processing and data portability, as well as a prohibition on linking (i.e. no linking of data from different areas). Unfortunately, educational institutions are still very poorly informed about the basics of data protection and possible risks when using digital services.
Nevertheless, data protection is being violated in many places: firstly through illegal activities such as the further unauthorized evaluation of registered data from smart meters for electricity and heating consumption, GPS data from mobile devices, information from cashless payments, etc. to obtain information about users' everyday behaviour. Another example is the illegal tapping and analysis of the medical data of all patients currently stored centrally by health insurance companies. Finally, the illegal further use of telephone recordings and the recording of telephone connections should be mentioned.
However, we also "voluntarily" disclose a lot of personal data about ourselves: on the Internet, you usually have to enter your personal data when you access a page.
"necessary" cookies, before using social media and many other programs, as well as some video conferences, you must agree to the terms and conditions that allow personal data to be tapped. A gray area is formed by new car models that use many sensors to store, send and make available for analysis data on the number of passengers, often also on their body weight, driving style and much more without explicit consent. All of these activities contribute to the multi-million dollar business of big data, where marketing strategists and political groups try to identify certain groups of people with such collections of personal data and use this knowledge to further their interests.
The many public surveillance cameras with facial recognition pose a further problem, as do the digital passports with significantly more biometric data that the German government, like many other European countries, wants to introduce. If you have the appropriate access, you should not only be able to retrieve the data from a standard passport, but also your vaccination status and other personal details.
For this reason, the ÖDP still sees considerable deficits in the enforcement of data protection and is calling for this:
 Compliance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its consistent enforcement by supervisory authorities in all EU member states as well as higher penalties for violations.
 National laws must not conflict with the intention of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or override the provisions contained therein (e.g. blanket release of personal data to the USA).
 The unrestricted right of all citizens to information about the processing and forwarding of their personal data.
 No softening of data protection through free trade agreements and other EU treaties with third countries.
 No lowering of the high data protection standards for medical data for health policy reasons, in particular no disclosure of medical data without the patient's consent, even for research purposes.
 A reservation of consent for data subjects if their data, which directly or indirectly contains information about their everyday behavior (e.g. smart meters for electricity consumption, GPS data from mobile devices, information from cashless payment), is used or passed on beyond the permissible purpose of registration.
 The special observation of non-European digital companies with big data interests (e.g. Facebook, Amazon, Google) operating on the European Internet with regard to compliance with the GDPR and other EU regulations.
 A ban on the unprovoked evaluation of video recordings in public spaces with facial recognition.
 A systematic evaluation of monitoring powers and programs.
Protecting internal security
The security authorities of the member states are working ever more closely together to maintain internal security in order to better counter cross-border crime. The exchange of database information from the various EU states via digital channels plays an important role in this. Also
Software systems for predicting serious crimes could contribute to stabilizing internal security.
The conflict-laden debate about climate protection and thus about the future expectations of future generations is currently increasingly leading to a division in society and thus to a threat to internal security by destabilizing the social consensus.
The availability of digital communication systems and thus the accessibility of a large number of people can make a positive contribution to such consensus-building. However, this reach can also be misused, namely for disinformation: Cambridge Analytica, for example, has influenced over two hundred elections worldwide, including the 2016 US presidential election and Brexit. However, it is not just about elections, but also about influencing and controlling groups with the aim of destabilizing the state.
That is why the ÖDP is calling for this in the EU:
 Better protection of critical infrastructure and public security against cyberattacks, espionage and terrorist attacks in all EU countries.
 Protection against targeted social and political manipulation by internet services such as social media, made possible by individually selected and filtered information distribution (content allocation ).21
 An expansion of the online network of the search databases22 of all EU states to support the national authorities and Europol in the EU-wide prosecution of criminal offenses, while safeguarding citizens' rights.
21 Personalized linking of data from different areas to profile an individual in order to assign them to a target group
22 For example, the Schengen Information System (SIS)
 A further expansion of Europol's staff to provide more effective support to national law enforcement authorities against international terrorist networks and organized crime such as human trafficking, organ theft and extortion.
 No reduction of police posts in favor of further use of surveillance technology.
 The development of an international crime prevention strategy.
 An extension of the powers of the Fundamental Rights Officer at Europol, in particular with regard to the right to issue instructions. The parliamentary monitoring group at Europol must be given a higher status and more powers.
 Democratically legitimized supervision of the activities of the European secret services.
 More protection for human rights activists and members of the opposition.
 The rejection of chat controls, unless they are ordered by a court in individual cases.
 No use of state Trojans and spying software (e.g. the "Pegasus" program) without a court order.
 Ensuring general life satisfaction through the problem-free supply of everyday goods with EU regulations on supply chains and ownership regulations for relevant infrastructure elements (e.g. ports, public transport, medical care).
 Increased EU-wide consensus building on climate protection and its consistent implementation as a security-promoting contribution to preserving the livelihoods of future generations (grandchildren's policy).
 Practicing peaceful conflict resolution in schools, the media and politics.
Foreign and defense policy
Although the European Union (EU) sees itself as an area of freedom, security and justice, it does not fully observe these principles in its foreign policy actions when it comes to asserting its own interests. For example, the Treaty on European Union (Treaty of Lisbon) allows military operations for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, even outside the EU (Art. 42 (1) of the Treaty on European Union)23 . However, such deployments are also possible in the service of its [the EU's] interests (Art. 42 (5)), which goes beyond the scope of military defense and enables wars of aggression, e.g. to secure access to oil wells, which is dressed up as a responsible security policy: Energy supplies will come from a limited number of countries whose stability [...] is by no means assured. They therefore present us with a variety of security challenges that require a responsible and united approach by all member states. 24 Decisions on such missions must be taken unanimously by the Heads of State and Government of the European Union and the Council of Ministers (Art. 42 (4)), but are taken without the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States having a say. A review of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the European Court of Justice is not possible.25

The ÖDP is therefore calling for this at EU level:
 Global respect for human rights as the primary goal of the CFSP.
 Focusing the CFSP on peace, conflict prevention, the search for peaceful solutions in conflict situations and humanitarian aid.
 No military deployment without a decision by the UN Security Council, with the exception of deployments under Article 51 of the UN Charter (right to collective self-defense).
 Commitment to consistent compliance with international law and the application of international criminal law instead of support for "humanitarian interventions" that are questionable under international law.
 Greater European independence from the USA through a common defense policy and coordination of armaments projects within the EU.
 Involvement of the EU Parliament in decisions on the EU's common foreign and defense policy, in particular the right to stop military operations.
 EU commitment to a global ban on nuclear weapons, as now demanded by more than 122 states in the UN.
 Amendment of the EU Treaty to prohibit military operations by the EU for oil and raw materials and to secure trade routes.
 A joint EU seat on the UN Security Council as an expression of the common foreign and security policy.
 Commitment to the abolition of the right of veto in the UN Security Council and the introduction of majority voting.
 Initiative to record looted cultural assets in European museums and offer to return them to their countries of origin.

Our vision:
a Europe that protects our livelihoods!
The ÖDP stands for a Europe of peace, freedom, democracy and human rights and for a socially just Europe that operates within planetary boundaries, preserves the natural foundations of life, puts the common good before individual profit and involves citizens in decision-making processes. This requires a departure from the dogma of unlimited economic growth, an efficient use of resources and the transition to a sustainable European circular economy.
Less is more! The ÖDP would like to work towards ensuring that all planned limits are observed. This requires comprehensive protection of the climate, species, biodiversity, air, water and soil. These protection goals must not be played off against each other and one must not be undermined at the expense of the other. Compliance with planetary boundaries is only possible if the common good, social justice and the participation of people in the necessary transformation processes are taken into account at the same time. Social equality, reducing income and wealth inequalities and the participation of citizens in direct democratic processes are the means we would like to use to achieve this.
We are aware that the rich countries of the EU must lead the way in this transformation in order to create a sustainable, just and peaceful future for all. We see a great responsibility towards future generations, but also a global responsibility towards the economically poorer countries of the global South.
Our political agenda aims to create a sustainable, just and peaceful future for all. We will fight to make our vision a reality. The protection of our natural resources, the common good and co- determination are the primary goals of our political action.
To this end, we are asking voters to cast their votes in the 2024 European elections.

First the facts, then the position!
Our political style
Progressive policy develops solutions based on scientific findings.
First we gather all the important facts, then we develop our position. In doing so, we are not only guided by scientific consensus, but also work according to scientific principles ourselves. Time and again, we critically question whether our viewpoints still correspond to the latest scientific findings. Changing your mind is not "buckling", it's sensible!
We fulfill this promise on the basis of our socially liberal values and the philosophy of evolutionary humanism. We are convinced that people themselves know best what is good for them and that neither the state nor society should stand in their way of realizing their life plans. To this end, it is essential that Europe meets its central challenges. We currently see these in five key areas:
1. Climate change & environmental protection
2. Migration & Integration
3. Economic recovery
4. European sovereignty & cooperation
5. Digitization & data protection
We are a full program party. The challenges mentioned represent our priorities for the 2024 European elections, not our entire party program. We are convinced that policies that listen to experts and combine their knowledge with social-liberal values are needed in every field. This includes a reform of the healthcare system, a fundamentally new approach to the education system, more state support for science and research, consistent secularization and a restructuring of social measures that are currently far too bureaucratic.
You can find our positions on these and other challenges at pdh.eu/program.
4	OUR POLITICAL
Climate change & Environmental protection
Climate change and environmental protection are key challenges of our time. Since the 19th century, the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels, has led to a significant increase in the average global temperature. As a result of man-made climate change, the probability of extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes and floods is increasing.
These changes threaten our livelihoods: landscapes are becoming uninhabitable due to rising sea levels and the biosphere cannot adapt quickly enough to climate change. The effects of climate change in Germany to date have been comparatively mild and public awareness of this problem has only increased in recent years. We are now at a point where rapid action is essential. The scientific consensus calls for a drastic reduction in human emissions in order to avert the most serious consequences of climate change and ensure a sustainable future.
The global community must become more active than before. Investing in climate protection and research will be more cost-effective in the long term than ignoring the impending dangers and clinging to an economic system based on fossil fuels.
In order to achieve the European climate targets, we adhere to a fixed upper limit for CO2 emissions. European countries issue limited CO2 emission allowances that can be purchased and traded by companies. This system makes it possible to reduce emissions in a market-conform and cost-efficient manner. Part of the revenue from emissions trading and CO2 taxation is used to promote the decarbonization of our economy and society. The remaining share is divided equally among all citizens and repaid. This redistribution mechanism benefits the lower income groups in particular. They receive back more than they have paid in, while the population with greater purchasing power is encouraged to prefer low-carbon products.2 With this approach, we create a balance between environmental protection and social fairness.
In order to create incentives for a recycling-oriented circular economy and minimize waste management, we are introducing a mandatory recycling quota for all EU member states, which wi l result in sanctions if it is not met. In order to prevent the circumvention of recycling quotas through waste exports, we are working with other member states to develop solutions to reduce their waste and are working towards an increasing recycling rate. We also promote
	ocean cleanup technologies and implement them in the
The scientific consensus calls for a drastic reduction in human emissions in order to avert the most serious consequences of climate change and ensure a sustainable future.
As one of the leading economic areas with one of the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions since the 19th century, Europe has a special responsibility. It must not only achieve its own targets, but also establish a global strategy for reducing emissions in cooperation with other major emitters such as the USA and China. This can only succeed if Europe itself plays its part in climate protection. Environmental protection is also an urgent task. For example, the biodiversity crisis and plastic waste in the oceans ultimately threaten our food chain. We are tackling these challenges with a clear and targeted policy without ideological blinkers and are giving the fight against climate change top political priority. In order to reduce emissions and protect Europe from the effects of climate change, we are anchoring the consideration of ecological and social aspects in the European market economy.
within the framework of European projects.
In order to effectively bind emissions and protect Europe from the effects of climate change, we are adapting our natural landscapes to climate change. We are achieving this through targeted renaturation measures in forests and wetlands. Peatlands in particular play a crucial role in climate protection, as they can store enormous amounts of CO2 and water. However, their drainage significantly reduces their CO2 storage function, which is why the protection and sustainable management of moors and alluvial forests are key measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We are also focusing on increased coastal protection. We recognize the potential of geoengineering methods and are promoting their use and further development. Geoengineering encompasses various technologies that can have a direct impact on the climate.
Some of these methods are already showing great promise in slowing global warming, while others require even more intensive research. We are convinced that they will be a valuable addition to our conventional climate protection strategies in the future.
In order to reduce emissions and protect Europe from the effects of climate change, we are actively promoting the development of new methods for low-CO2 electricity generation and storage. In doing so, we consistently and undogmatically consider all existing technologies and ensure a balanced mix of centralized and decentralized generation and storage capacities. Renewable energies are at the forefront of our strategy, and by promoting them we are creating jobs and boosting the economy. In order to make it possible to phase out coal as early as possible throughout the EU, we will continue to rely on low-carbon nuclear energy.2 We are modernizing safe nuclear power plants and ensuring their continued operation, while resuming research and development of new types of power plants. We are equipping nuclear reactors for fast load sequencing so that they can be used in conjunction with renewable energies.
The further development of nuclear fission technologies to fully utilize the energy content of uranium and to convert long-lived radioactive waste into short-lived radioactive waste as well as nuclear fusion are also central components of our research funding. We are having a panel of experts work out the exact timetable for the transition to modern nuclear reactor types. We will also revise the EU taxonomy: It is the result of political negotiations rather than scientific analysis. For example, we are critical of the inclusion of natural gas in the taxonomy and call for nuclear energy to be recognized as a long-term climate-friendly and environmentally friendly technology instead of just a bridging technology.
In order to reduce emissions and protect	Europe from the effects of climate change, we are creating a climate-friendly	and	climate-resilient transport infrastructure. Rail	transport	is	one	of	the	most climate-friendly means of transportation for both freight and passengers and is therefore the focus of our efforts.	In	the	 long	term,	we	are	working	 on	the harmonization of cross-border rail transport in Europe in	order	to	overcome	technical	challenges	such	as different track gauges or current voltages. To make train travel in Europe more attractive, we are introducing a European ticket for all European local and regional transport, supporting the establishment of night trains and reforming the Interrail ticket. Standardized booking platforms	and	tariff	 systems	will	complement	this process and reform rail transport in Europe.
In order to reduce emissions and protect Europe from the effects of climate change, we are modernizing European agriculture.
We promote the bioeconomy, which uses biological instead of fossil raw materials, through targeted measures in research, education and industrial development. We minimize the environmental impact by promoting the combination of conventional and organic farming methods. We strive for sustainable intensification using all available technologies in order to free up land for renaturation. Biodiversity benefits more from this than from land-intensive organic farming. Agricultural certificates such as
"Organic" labels are only awarded if the production
is sustainable, resource-saving and low in CO .2
We are also committed to scientifically sound decisions on	genetic	 engineering	applications	and	products	and increasingly	support	biotechnological	research	in agriculture	and	medicine.	We	reject	dogmatically motivated	restrictions	on	the	use	 of genetic engineering. Glyphosate has been scientifically proven to be one of the most efficient plant protection products. When used correctly, there is no increased risk of	cancer	for	users	or	consumers.	We	therefore extend the approval of glyphosate and reject approval requirements that come close to a ban in practice. We promote	and	simplify	the	replacement	of animal products with plant-based, biotechnological or synthetically produced alternatives. To this end, we are reforming the EU Novel Food Regulation to improve the integration of new food technologies and products.
Standards in livestock farming must be based on scientific findings about the high sensitivity of animals. In this way, we are creating comprehensive improvements in the living conditions of millions of animals. We reduce animal testing to the minimum necessary to combat life-threatening human diseases and are committed to the development and use of alternative methods to animal testing.
We are fundamentally changing EU subsidies for agriculture. Instead of flat-rate subsidies or support based on acreage or production, farmers would be supported on the basis of concrete, verifiable results in areas such as animal welfare, climate protection and environmental protection. They would also be remunerated for ecosystem services such as the creation of flower strips, the improvement of soil and water quality or the storage of CO2 in arable soils. You can find all of our positions on climate, environment, agriculture and animal welfare at pdh.eu/gsp/climate-environment- agriculture-animal-protection and the detailed section on climate protection at pdh.eu/climate-change.

Migration &
Integration
Migration, a shortage of skilled workers, demographic change and the associated young talent, education and pension problems pose major challenges for Europe. Immigration into the labor market helps to counteract the shortage of skilled workers and demographic change. Recognized refugees and asylum seekers with the prospect of staying are, if successfully integrated, an asset to our society and our economy. At the same time, immigration is associated with risks if the authorities and local authorities are overburdened by the influx of asylum seekers. The consequences are unregulated immigration, rejected but not deported asylum seekers and a lack of integration, which contributes to the emergence of parallel societies. In addition, there are mass deaths in the Mediterranean and on the refugee routes as a whole, which must be stopped as a matter of urgency.
Strict controls at the EU's external borders are necessary to curb illegal immigration and ensure Europe's security.
Those who make it to Europe are often not the most vulnerable or needy, but tend to be those who have the means, resources and physical strength to make the dangerous journey. This raises questions about the current direction of our asylum policy. Furthermore, Europe must not violate its values, for example through illegal pushbacks. These politically unresolved grievances also contribute to the rise of right-wing populism and right-wing radicalism, which further deepens the social divide. It is therefore imperative that we recognize both the opportunities and challenges of migration and identify rational solutions. If Europe succeeds in combating the causes of flight, managing migration, promoting legal migration into the labour market, ensuring the integration of asylum seekers with prospects of remaining and recognized refugees and consistently deporting asylum seekers without prospects of remaining, Europe will benefit.
For a regulated and responsible migration policy, we are	clearly	committed	to	the right to asylum, the Geneva	Convention	on	Refugees	and	 the	right	to subsidiary protection. We reject populist and restrictive solutions such as upper limits, as they	could lead to us not granting adequate protection to refugees in need of protection in emergency situations, such as the	attack	on	Ukraine,	which	is	contrary	to international law. For the security of our
society, migrants who have repeatedly or seriously committed criminal offenses must be deported. If they are threatened with persecution or punishment practices that violate human rights, such as torture, in their home country, they cannot be deported. They must then be treated	in	accordance	with	 German	criminal	law.	If asylum applications are rejected or the need for protection no longer applies, we pursue a consistent repatriation	policy	that	deals	humanely	with situations	such	as	illness,	pregnancy	and	affected children.
Strict controls at the EU's external borders are necessary to curb illegal immigration and ensure Europe's security. Internal European border controls, on the other hand, contradict freedom of movement, one of the central achievements of modern Europe, and are also highly ineffective. The infrastructure required is disproportionate to the potential benefit of identifying immigrants, who ultimately still have a right to a regulated procedure.
For a regulated and responsible migration policy, we are pooling Europe's strengths in a joint office for refugees	and	migration.	This	is	where	 we coordinate European refugee policy centrally. We are in	favor	of	automated,	computer-aided	preliminary checks	of	asylum	applications	whose	 algorithms	are transparent and comprehensible. This not only speeds up the	admission	process,	but	also	improves	 the consistency and objectivity of decisions. A fully digital solution simplifies	and	speeds	up	the	process	 of registering,	distributing	and	 forwarding refugees. This significantly reduces bureaucratic effort, relieves the burden on authorities and enables asylum procedures to be processed more quickly.
For a regulated and responsible migration policy, we are establishing a fair system for the distribution of refugees and asylum seekers throughout the EU. The current regulation, according to which every person seeking protection must apply for asylum where they enter the EU, is unfair and overburdens countries at the EU's external borders. Together with other EU member states, we are working towards fair distribution in order to relieve the burden on the primary countries of arrival, such as Greece and Italy.
For a regulated and responsible migration policy, we define	clear	European	criteria	for	third	countries	to determine	which	of	them	can	be	classified	as safe countries of origin. These criteria should be adopted by parliament. Instead of each European country deciding individually which third countries it classifies as safe, we are striving for a
coordinated and uniform approach. This is essential for an EU external border without controlled internal borders, avoids inefficient and lengthy political debates about individual countries and instead creates clarity. A third country that meets the defined criteria is classified as a safe country of origin. If it no longer meets the criteria, it loses this status. Together with our European partners, we are developing these criteria, whereby the rule of law and respect for human rights are absolute minimum standards. These minimum standards apply not only to safe countries of origin, but also to all other third countries with which we are aiming to conclude repatriation agreements and negotiations on migration cooperation. The joint approach serves a migration strategy based on solidarity and strengthens the united external impact of the European Union.
For a regulated and responsible migration policy, we actively	tackle	the causes of flight. This	can	be achieved by tackling factors such as a lack of economic prospects	or	threats	from	climate	change	locally. Climate	change	is	one	of	the	biggest	causes	of displacement. Countries with low levels of prosperity are particularly at risk. Effective climate policy can therefore also help to regulate migration. By helping to tackle these problems locally and at the same time curbing our own emissions, we can limit displacement before it occurs.
We see great benefit in the expansion of partnerships between the EU and other nations. These are indispensable in view of China's growing influence in Asia and Africa. Europe must present itself there as an attractive partner and initiate long-term economic relationships that improve local living standards and also create new sales markets for the European economy. We use our refugee aid effectively where people are in need, especially internally displaced persons. We are increasing the budget of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and making international efforts to improve the living conditions of those seeking protection in the host countries.
In order to benefit from migration, we define our economic needs. Immigration can help to counteract the shortage of skilled workers. Therefore, anyone who is in a position to meet such a need, for example by working as a skilled worker in Europe, should have the opportunity to apply their qualifications in the European labor market. That is why we recognize more international qualifications and specifically simplify immigration into our labour market.
This also includes approving, actively enabling and demanding gainful employment during the ongoing admission process. This facilitates integration and provides valuable insights into the qualifications of immigrants. Those who are socially integrated and working are not rejected, but accepted. We also carry out development work in emerging and developing countries by supporting skilled workers in their training with the option of working in Europe.
We	 see	immigration	and	cultural	diversity	as	an opportunity.	Immigration	can	strengthen	science, innovation, research and education in Europe and have a positive impact on the economic prospects of our	community	of	values.	We	therefore	promote international	cooperation	and	networking	of specialists and are a platform for professional and scientific	exchange.	By	expanding	uniform	European educational	guidelines,	we	 are	modernizing	the education system and facilitating access to top-quality education,	 including for children with a migrant background. Educational opportunities must be made available as early as kindergarten age within the framework of ideologically neutral kindergartens. This is how we counteract the emergence of parallel societies. Together, we will master the challenges of globalization, digitalization and technological progress with a high-quality education system.
For regulated and responsible integration, we rely on the principle of "support and demand". This means that all migrants are granted fundamental rights and equal opportunities.	In	return,	 we	strictly	demand	a willingness to integrate and the recognition of European, humanistic values. Lip service is not enough and must be underpinned by clear actions. These fundamental values include equal rights for all genders, democratic principles, freedom of opinion, freedom of religion, self-determination	and	responsibility,	respect	for minorities	and	sexual	self-determination.	We	make	it unmistakably clear that religious fundamentalism, such as Islamism, is incompatible with our secular values and has	no	place	 in	our	society.	Free educational opportunities, in particular integration and language courses, are central to integration and must therefore be provided	to	a	greater	extent.	We	not	 only	attach importance to vocational qualifications, but also to teaching	 the	cultures and lifestyles of the host country. All-day schools and early childhood education with special integration programs are particularly important here. Another focus is the rapid integration
of migrants into the labor market. Finally, we emphasize the importance of active participation in social life. In order to promote integration into local community life, we provide financial support so that all immigrants have the opportunity to play an active role. You can find all of our positions in the area of Democracy & Home Affairs at pdh.eu/democracy-home-affairs.

Economic
Recreation
The European economy is the engine of our prosperity and our welfare state. This prosperity can be increased and the recovery of the European economy secured with smart political decisions. In the midst of global changes, we are facing urgent challenges. Tax avoidance must be consistently combated in order to ensure fair competitive conditions and fair revenues for all member states. The transformation towards a CO2 neutral economy and adapting to the already noticeable consequences of climate change are key tasks that we face.
Rapid digitalization and technological innovations offer immense opportunities, but also entail risks. Uniform, reformed standards in dealing with public debt are necessary to ensure financial stability and at the same time enable investment for future challenges. Our aim is to seize these opportunities and ensure that no one is left behind. Globalization, despite its benefits, also brings with it geopolitical challenges and dependencies in supply chains. It is therefore important to strengthen our resilience while reaping the benefits of global trade.
In view of these challenges, we are committed to a socio-ecological market economy based on human values such as individual freedom and fair compensation. The overarching goal is a market economy that is geared towards the well-being of all and protects the livelihoods of future generations. By joining forces and sharing common values, Europe will shape a future in which prosperity, sustainability and social justice go hand in hand.
For the recovery of the European economy, we are giving all economic players active in Europe a fair share of the public finances. Tax avoidance not only contradicts democratic principles, but also threatens social justice. In fact, the EU member states, and therefore its citizens, lose almost one trillion euros a year through tax evasion. In response,	we	are	creating	a	European	authority aimed at combating tax evasion and eliminating tax loopholes	and	establishing	a	consistent	European	tax system.	Furthermore,	we	are	implementing	a global minimum tax of 15 % on corporate profits in order to minimize	tax	avoidance	and	prevent	tax	dumping between countries. Countries that do not comply with this minimum rate will be subject to sanctions. When it comes to taxation, we attach great importance to ensuring that it is shared fairly between the country in which the profit is generated and the country in which it is earned.
and the country in which the company is based. This ensures that companies contribute appropriately to tax revenues, which in turn creates room for tax cuts for the general public or investments in social welfare, education, health and defense.
Becoming a leader in developing solutions to the challenges of our time is crucial for the recovery of the European economy. Europe must reduce its CO2 emissions and at the same time prepare for the already unavoidable consequences of climate change. These challenges also present economic opportunities. The technologies that are currently being developed are of great importance to us. We are therefore committed to ensuring that they are developed and produced in Europe in order to minimize our dependence on totalitarian regimes such as China and endangered democracies such as the USA. With targeted investment in the research, development and application of climate-friendly technologies, Europe can dominate a new economic sector, combat climate change and protect itself from its effects.
Globalization, despite its benefits, also brings with it geopolitical challenges and dependencies in supply chains. It is therefore important to strengthen our resilience and at the same time benefit from the advantages of global trade.
A secure and affordable energy supply is essential for the recovery of the European economy. However, the integrated European electricity grid, an impressive technical achievement, is facing challenges due to rising	energy	prices,	increasing	electricity	demand and the need for decarbonization.
To meet these challenges, we are focusing on the expansion of low-CO2 energy sources and promoting innovative energy storage technologies. These measures balance out fluctuations in the electricity grid and increase security of supply. At the same time, we are investing in research and development in order to make our energy system future-proof and sustainable. In this way, we are ensuring a fair and sustainable energy supply for future generations. Rising energy prices can lead to social imbalances and put a strain on the European economy. A reform of the European electricity market is therefore crucial.
Our goal is a transparent, cost-efficient market that offers consumers planning security and meets climate protection targets. By strengthening European emissions trading, we can achieve these goals in line with the market. A revision of the market design, including the merit order principle, is essential. Some of the revenue from emissions trading should flow back to the population as a climate bonus in order to boost the economy and increase acceptance of climate policy.
It is crucial for the recovery of the European economy to catch up with digitalization and transform Europe into a pioneering continent for digital infrastructure. Investments in digitalization strengthen Europe as a business location and offer people new opportunities to overcome everyday challenges. A particular focus of our investments lies in the research and development of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has the potential to bring about revolutionary changes in areas such as health diagnostics (through early detection of diseases) or energy efficiency (through optimized control of smart grids).
It is crucial for the recovery of the European economy to catch up with digitalization and transform Europe into a pioneering continent for digital infrastructure.
Modern working conditions are another key item on our agenda. We create incentives for flexible working models such as working from home and remote working in order to meet the demands of today's working world. We also attach importance to shaping the structural change associated with digitalization in a socially responsible way, particularly when dealing with technologies such as AI. In addition to software development, we are promoting the development and production of hardware such as computer chips in Europe. This step not only makes economic sense, but also serves to ensure independence from increasingly uncertain international supply chains.
We are driving forward the modernization and digitalization of payment traffic to boost the European economy. Secure digital payment methods facilitate trade and offer consumers flexibility. We are committed to ensuring that card payments and digital payments, for example with smart phones, are widely possible and accepted throughout Europe. The issue of small coin denominations is also relevant in this context,
especially the one and two-cent coins. Their production costs exceed their face value and their purchasing power is minimal. Inflation further exacerbates this problem. While some EU countries already apply rounding rules to the nearest 5 cents, others do not. To create clarity and consistency across the euro area, we are campaigning for the abolition of these coins.
How we deal with public debt is crucial for the recovery of the European economy. The current Maastricht criteria, which limit this debt, are based more on political decisions than on sound economic knowledge. That is why we are reforming these criteria by scientifically reviewing and adapting them. Taxpayers' money and new debt must be used efficiently and invested specifically in future-oriented projects such as infrastructure, digitalization and sustainable energy development. This benefits European citizens twice over, as it limits debt on the one hand and invests in important areas that promote prosperity on the other.
We rely on robust and resilient supply chains for the recovery of the European economy. European companies are heavily integrated into international production and trade networks, which opens up opportunities but also	entails	risks.	One	example	of	this	is	the dependence on rare earths from certain countries, which are essential for many technologies. Another example is the dependence on pharmaceuticals and medical products, which are often produced outside Europe.	In	times	of	geopolitical	tensions	or	global pandemics, this can lead to bottlenecks. To counter such risks, we diversify our sources of supply and promote the extraction and processing of critical raw materials and the production of essential medicines directly in the EU. In order to meet the challenges of globalization, we are strengthening our resilience and at the same time focusing on fair competitive conditions.
To boost the European economy, we are strengthening its backbone: entrepreneurship.	Performance	and initiative must be rewarded in order to help Europe achieve new growth and offer everyone the chance to advance. High taxes and excessive bureaucracy must not be allowed	to	slow	down	entrepreneurs.	Market regulations must not be barriers to market entry for start-ups and thus protective walls for corporations.
Small and medium-sized enterprises and innovative start- ups in particular are bringing a breath of fresh air to the market, challenging established players and creating new jobs.
With their creativity and ambition, they make a significant contribution to social prosperity. Our support for these players includes financial support, facilitating investment and reducing bureaucracy. We simplify and promote the participation of employees in companies and encourage companies to offer their employees this opportunity. We therefore also support the jointly democratic legal form of the cooperative. This turns employees into co-entrepreneurs, giving them a say and a fair share in the joint success. In addition, social security is guaranteed by a basic income to be gradually introduced. This contributes to social stability, supports education and training, enables artists, for example, to pursue their passion, reduces poverty and creates incentives for innovation and entrepreneurship.
For the recovery of the European economy, we support citizens who want to live self-determined lives and take advantage of the opportunities offered by our economic system. This includes small investors who want to provide for their future or strive for financial freedom. In view of the uncertain outlook for pensions, it is important to provide not only state
Summary
to also promote funded pension provision. Direct banks and neobrokers give consumers better opportunities to invest in the capital market at low cost and to become informed investors through free financial education. We reject the currently planned ban on "payment for order flow". This enables securities trading at favorable conditions even for small investors without large trading volumes. A ban would mean the end of neobrokers and damage the share culture. Young people in particular, who use this form of retirement provision, would be harmed. Instead, we are calling for more transparency regarding the remuneration of neobrokers.
These developments democratize the capital market and enable citizens to build up assets over the long term. As long-term investing over more than 15 years is a proven strategy, we are increasing the saver's lump sum across Europe to EUR 3,000, adjusted for inflation. This allows small investors to benefit optimally from their investments. You can find all our positions in the Economy & Taxes section at pdh.eu/economic-taxes.

European sovereignty &
cooperation
27 member states, around 450 million inhabitants and a gross domestic product that rivals that of China - all united by a common set of values: that is the European Union. Its motto i s : "United in diversity". We live by this principle. At the moment, however, Europe often plays small.
The EU is failing to pursue a coherent foreign policy and assert its interests internationally due to disputes and blockades by some member states. Only a Europe that stands together can present a united front to the outside world and take its place on the world stage. This also includes expanding protection against divisive external influences, such as those recently exerted by Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin. The people themselves are crucial to this. They shape the continent of Europe, the direction of its politics and international coexistence. In this chapter, we outline our goals for the next steps in the development of the European Union, which we will pursue in the European Parliament: how we can strengthen Europe's unity, secure its sovereignty on the
interest of the general public. EU citizens must always be able to see which players have a financial influence on political decisions. We are optimizing the EU's information portal and making it more user-friendly so that citizens have easier and more intuitive access to relevant information.
For true transparency, we are reforming the provisions on the "legislative footprint". In the annex to reports on legislative texts, this lists all lobbyists with whom a member of parliament was in contact during the drafting of a law. We are abolishing the current practice for lobbyists to choose their own "registration category". Finally, we emphasize the protection of whistleblowers from reprisals where there is a justified public interest. In these cases, the public interest outweighs the welfare of the state or private institution.
In order to strengthen European cohesion, we are giving the Parliament elected by the citizens of Europe more rights.
world stage and implement a common foreign policy.	
In order to strengthen European cohesion, we are giving the Parliament elected by the citizens of Europe more rights. Until now, the European Parliament has only had a very limited right of initiative. We are extending this to a fundamental right to introduce legislative initiatives. This will allow citizens to participate much more directly in European legislative projects.
We	are	ending	the absurd coexistence of two parliamentary seats in Brussels and Strasbourg, which not only costs at least 100 million euros a year, but also involves enormous logistical challenges, the monthly transportation	of	vast	amounts	of	 material	and	the movement of thousands of people, as well as causing enormous amounts of CO2 every year, in favour of the Brussels	location.	In	addition,	we	are	reducing	the unanimity principle in the Council of the European Union to a minimum. A qualified majority will then apply to most political decisions. This will increase the EU's efficiency and ability to act.
In order to strengthen European cohesion, we are increasing transparency and thus creating new trust in the institutions of the European Union. This includes mandatory registration of all political actors in the lobby register. We are abolishing existing exemptions for religious and political actors in order to ensure complete transparency. We are reforming the regulations on party donations. In doing so, we are balancing the protection of the privacy of the individual and the
In order to secure Europe's sovereignty globally, we are implementing a common foreign policy. Europe is currently economically dependent on states that act in an authoritarian manner and disregard human rights. It is unacceptable that products that are consumed and used in Europe were produced using forced labor, by children or under other inhumane circumstances. In order to live up to our responsibility, we enforce compliance with human rights with our trading partners. All our external and economic policy activities are intended to help improve the situation of people in these countries.
We are introducing an EU-wide supply chain law that obliges companies to comply with social, human rights, environmental and climate-friendly standards throughout their entire value chain. We will sanction companies that do not meet these standards. In this way, citizens can be sure when buying and consuming products that they meet basic ethical standards. In the long term, we are striving to reduce our global dependency by becoming a leader in the development of future technologies. To this end, we invest heavily in research and development. We are convinced that the most advanced countries will prevail in global competition and thus be able to initiate relationships that do justice to their own interests. We must be one of these countries. Economic strength is essential for this. We describe how we are giving the European economy new impetus in the "Economic recovery" chapter.
In order to secure Europe's sovereignty globally, we are shaping further-reaching and comprehensive development cooperation with countries in the Global South. China has also recently been able to expand its influence in this area. We present ourselves to the Global South as an attractive and reliable partner that keeps its promises and supports sustainable development based on the principle of helping people to help themselves locally. This creates new sales markets and potential research locations for us and improves relations with young and unestablished democracies. In order to make development cooperation more efficient, we are gradually transferring bilateral state development cooperation from the individual member states to the EU as a whole. The member states should consistently adhere to the 0.7% of GDP set for development cooperation. A basic democratic orientation is a fundamental condition for any cooperation that serves the further development of a country and its society. Humanitarian aid is not affected by this.
In order to secure Europe's sovereignty globally, we are striving for greater integration of the existing national armies in the EU and are focusing on the creation of a common European army in the long term. There are 27 national armies within the EU, each with its own structures, weapons systems and training. A more integrated military structure would not only be more cost- efficient, but also more effective in terms of defense and international peacekeeping. It would also reduce military dependence on the USA and enable Europe to do more justice to its contribution to transatlantic burden- sharing. In order to live up to our global responsibility, we must be in a position to independently counter security-relevant trouble spots in the long term. Particularly in the immediate geographical vicinity of Russia, it is important to represent our own geopolitical interests as a sovereign defense actor.
In order to strengthen European cohesion, we are developing Europe into a continent of first-class, free education for all. The independence and
We promote student autonomy to a greater extent than is currently the case in European education systems, for example through earlier and more extensive opportunities for students to design their own timetables and subject combinations. We are harmonizing educational standards, thereby achieving Europe-wide recognition for them. We promote regular exchange programs for students and teachers, also for the purpose of exchanging teaching methods, and lifelong learning.
In order to secure Europe's sovereignty globally, we are striving for greater integration of the existing national armies in the EU and are focusing on the creation of a common European army in the long term.
To strengthen European cohesion, we connect the people of Europe. This includes the student exchange programs described above and an expansion of the Erasmus+ program. We are establishing a Europe-wide, discounted European rail ticket and expanding the Interrail offer. We are also establishing media partnerships between other countries along the lines of the Franco-German broadcaster arte. We are also reforming and bundling public media institutions into a European institution with various sub-houses.
This public broadcaster should exclusively pursue an educational and informational mission within the framework of critical and neutral reporting and - in contrast to the German ÖRR - not dedicate its main output to entertainment. Together we are shaping an informed, educated and globally neutral Europe. You can find all our positions on Europe in general at pdh.eu/Europe, and all our positions on foreign policy and defense at pdh.eu/gsp/foreign-policy-defense. We present our long-term vision for the continent at pdh.eu/bundesrepublikeuropa.

Digitization &
Data protection
The potential of digitalization is enormous. It makes our everyday and working lives easier, makes our administrations more efficient and can make political processes more citizen-friendly. It has the potential to make life easier and at the same time promote ecological and economic sustainability. In areas such as research, health and safety, digitalization offers opportunities to significantly improve our standard of living. We are therefore placing a particular focus on researching and developing further technologies.
But with these advances also come challenges: Protecting data in digital health records, ensuring security and integrity on online platforms and integrating artificial intelligence into the world of work are just some of the issues that arise. There is an urgent need for political regulation to ensure that digitalization progresses in line with the values and rights of citizens.
Upload filters, which are used as a means of state censorship
could be used, we reject this.
In order to shape Europe's digital future, we guarantee every citizen reliable Internet access and seamless mobile phone coverage. Despite our global network, there are still deficits in some rural areas. By expanding this infrastructure in a targeted manner, we are improving the quality of life in these regions. Today, mobile Internet access is almost as basic as electricity and water. That is why we promote tariffs that do not have data limits or minimum terms and that are based on actual consumption.
With a robust digital infrastructure, we are laying the foundations for numerous benefits: from the sustainable use of resources and democratic participation to innovative education and self-determination. To make this vision a reality, we are making targeted investments in our infrastructure, offering providers financial incentives and reducing unnecessary regulations.
In order to shape Europe's digital future, we offer all European	citizens free	education	and	training opportunities with the latest digital technology. To this end, we ensure that state-run further education institutions are equipped with the latest hardware and software across the board. It is important to us not only to provide access to technology, but also to promote	critical	and	responsible	use.	This	includes educating people about digital phenomena such as filter bubbles, disinformation and conspiracy theories. We are also firmly integrating artificial intelligence into the school curriculum.
We use open source solutions to shape Europe's digital future. The accessibility of open source products creates trust and allows everyone to benefit from them. Interested parties can transparently understand which data is collected and processed. This is why we support the use of open source software and are gradually switching to it in public administration and educational institutions. In principle, we also promote freely accessible software. We examine the use of software that is not freely accessible in terms of its appropriateness and avoid dependencies on individual providers. In addition, we provide targeted funding for the development of further open source projects that benefit the general public.
In	order	to	shape	Europe's	digital	future,	we	are reforming	copyright	and	quotation	law and standardizing it across Europe. This should reward creativity and innovation without hindering progress or placing	a	disproportionate	burden	on	private individuals. We therefore advocate a reduction in the copyright protection period to ten years after the death of the author instead of the current 70 years. We make works whose copyrights are owned by the state available to all citizens free of charge.
We limit the profit-oriented warning practice for private use of copyrighted works. We reject upload filters that could be used as a means of state censorship. We are also opposed to censorship in entertainment media, particularly in the case of video games. Online offeringsE should be accessible throughout Europe without geo- blocking.
In order to shape Europe's digital future, we are promoting flexible working models such as working from home and remote working. These models offer citizens more freedom and adaptability in their professional activities. The entire world of work is undergoing fundamental structural change. We see it as our task to actively support and drive this process forward. At the same time, we ensure that no one is left behind. To this end, we facilitate and promote professional development and further training. This enables all citizens to adapttothe changing requirements of the labor market.
Increasing automation could mean that fewer workers are needed. In this case, we will use targeted redistribution measures to ensure that gainful employment is not necessary in order to enjoy prosperity. The basic income mentioned above should also serve the purpose of social protection here. We see artificial intelligence not only as a technology that generates prosperity, but also as an opportunity to reduce the workload of the workforce.
society. Our long-term goal is to create a society in which work becomes increasingly optional.
By shaping Europe's digital future, we are opening up new avenues in the fight against crime and criminal prosecution. We are implementing standardized systems for electronic data processing, the exchange of information and the processing of specific incidents and cases. These measures promote efficient cooperation and networking between police and security authorities throughout Europe. In addition, almost all administrative procedures will become superfluous for Europe's citizens. To this end, we are expanding secure, digital administrative services.
In order to protect Europe in the digital age, we are subjecting critical infrastructure such as energy and water supply, hospitals, police, financial authorities and satellites to the strictest security standards. We attach great importance to ensuring that the technology and equipment is sourced from European providers wherever possible. By further developing modern technologies and strengthening our intelligence services, we are able to prevent and counter potential threats.
In order to make science and knowledge available to all European citizens, we rely on a consistent open data strategy. Publicly relevant data will be made accessible free of charge. To this end, we are establishing a central platform that stores and provides extensive scientific data sets. We are making content financed by public funds - whether from public media or research institutions - permanently accessible throughout the EU, free of charge and without bureaucratic hurdles. Our aim is to promote Open Science throughout Europe. This means that research results, data and laboratory reports are made public.
and are available for free use by all citizens. This also promotes citizen research and increases transparency in science. In this way, we are opposing the current practice of fee-based journals and their access restrictions such as paywalls, for which we will find solutions that benefit science and citizens.
In order to protect the data of European citizens in the digital	age,	we	are	establishing	uniform	data protection guidelines for all security authorities in Europe.	When	regulating	the	powers	of	intelligence services, we place the highest value on data protection and prevent the arbitrary collection of personal data. We reject restrictions on digital communication, in particular special	access	by	state	services	to	encrypted messages.	We	also	reject	the	use	of	widespread biometric surveillance technologies, as such a practice is at odds with our socially liberal values. Every citizen should have the right to obtain information about their data stored in police databases, with exceptions only applying in cases of public safety.
In order to protect the data of European citizens in the digital age, we enable informational self- determination, which we consider to be an essential part of individual freedom. Only those who are not monitored can develop freely. Every citizen in Europe should retain full control over their data, regardless of where it i s	collected and processed. We firmly reject measures such as data retention, which place citizens under blanket suspicion in order to access their data. You can find all of our positions on digitalization and network policy at pdh.eu/gsp/digitalization-network- policy.

Closing words
These are our ideas for the five central topics for the Europe of the coming years. In the long term, we are pursuing an even more ambitious goal:
The completion of European unity in the form of a federal state. But there is still a long way to go until then. The task now is to tackle people's everyday problems with pragmatic policies and offer them solutions. You can find our complete vision at pdh.eu/program.
We are convinced that Europe needs a new political style far removed from populism and old-fashioned trench warfare. A vote for the PdH will give you a breath of fresh air and a strong commitment to social-liberal values.
We take your concerns seriously and do not allow ourselves to be influenced by those who are the loudest.
We listen to experts and look for socially acceptable solutions to the pressing issues of our time.

Preamble
Today's European Union (EU) as a supranational institution is a project of its member states and not of its citizens. The Pirates believe that Europe should be organized in such a way that it serves the common interests of all European citizens as well as the interests of the member states.
The Pirates in the European Union have adopted this election manifesto and are working together to realize our vision for the Union.
The democratic deficit in the European Union has existed since its foundation and has not been sufficiently remedied in the course of the integration process.
A key goal of all Pirates is to create a solid democratic foundation for the Union. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to make political processes more citizen-friendly. Together we must promote the development of a common European area for culture, politics and civil society in order to protect the rich and diverse cultures within the Union.
The EU must live up to its own principles of subsidiarity. Decisions should not be taken at EU level if they can be better resolved at national, regional or local level. Equal and easy access to communication and an informed citizenry are essential prerequisites for legitimate democratic decision-making. Political decisions at European level must be preceded by a Europe-wide debate and allow for adequate participation by all.
The Pirates firmly believe that all people must have the right to fair and equal treatment. Society must respect the rights of minorities. We will stand up against all forms of discrimination and oppose movements that act against human rights.
The Internet as a communication medium offers enormous opportunities for political development and overcomes one-sided top-down communication. The Pirates will therefore vigorously defend the freedom of the Internet at European and global level.

Towards a sustainable Europe and a sustainable planet
CEEP PPEU
As we are part of nature, our quality of life depends on natural resources such as unpolluted water, air, soil and food in our homes. We need to achieve sustainable and healthy food production for all, now and in the future. We advocate a strong role for the ENVI, AGRI, PECH and REGI committees, provided that lessons are learned from past mistakes in EU agricultural policy. It is their task to protect our natural resources and to transform the exploitation of nature into the flourishing of nature.
The Pirates demand that the ambitious environmental promises and plans made at EU and international level are kept (and if possible exceeded). This applies both to the conservation and promotion of biodiversity in agricultural ecosystems and to greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.
Agriculture and horticulture in the cities and suburbs must be promoted in order to reduce traffic, ensure food security, disseminate knowledge and satisfy human needs.
In trade agreements with third countries, the EU must avoid unfair trade practices based on its trading power. Exports of European food surpluses to third countries must be reassessed if they risk damaging local food markets.
Subsidies only for the common good
We want a Common Agricultural Policy that supports natural and cultural diversity. We are convinced that the diversity of food production, which is locally adapted and in the hands of many independent and self-determined actors, also ensures food security and quality of life in rural and urban areas.
The CAP should encourage farmers to adapt to climate change in terms of technologies and choice of crops or breeds. The CAP must provide a framework that establishes equal rights, opportunities and obligations. The role of subsidies in European agricultural policy must change towards a stronger focus on diversity and equality. Financial support must be granted according to sustainability criteria and not on the basis of area or production.
As agriculture in the EU has a high level of overproduction and production can be marketed using standard market means, subsidies should only support the common good. The destruction of ecosystems should not be used as an excuse for social problems in agricultural policy. The Pirates want to preserve and support small-scale farming and subsistence agriculture in order to strengthen resilience.

Use of technology and digital solutions
CEEP PPEU
The principle of "no patents on life" must be strictly upheld. The EU should create the framework for open access to digital applications and open interfaces. Publicly funded data,
e.g. on climate, weather, soil and water, must be easily accessible to the public. The EU must ensure that such data sets obtained using proprietary technologies do not end up in private hands.
Forestry
The EU should do more to incentivize practices that lead to biodiversity conservation and restoration, water retention and carbon sequestration in forests, both in terms of regulation and funding. But we must learn from the mistakes of the Common Agricultural Policy. The aim is to support the development of a sustainable industry, both economically and environmentally. The EU must enforce strict protection of old forests and old trees in all other parts of the countryside.
Animal welfare
All animals deserve to be treated humanely. The Pirates support the strengthening of measures that ensure proper care and husbandry and less painful slaughter, such as the abolition of cage farming as soon as possible, the introduction of species-specific standards for all farm animals, the ban on the export of live animals to third countries and the reduction of long transports of live animals through the introduction of strict absolute time limits. The lack of transparency regarding husbandry conditions and education about animal welfare in modern farming systems must be addressed, e.g. by labeling animal products according to the production method. The Pirates support the further development of meat alternatives and incentives to switch to a more plant-based diet.
Sustainable fishing
Fishing quotas must be revised to bring them into line with scientifically proven sustainability and to protect small-scale fisheries. The EU should expand its measures to combat illegal fishing. Marine protected areas should be given an adequate and harmonized level of protection by banning unsustainable practices that harm biodiversity, such as bottom trawling or extractive activities. The development of large-scale aquaculture should also be closely monitored to ensure animal welfare, a balance between feeding and fishing, better integration into the environment and ecosystem, and traceability. The EU should push to allow fish migration in rivers, in particular by removing unnecessary dams.

Election program for the 2024 European elections
CEEP PPEU
Civil society
Civil society is an essential part of any democratic society as it plays a crucial role in ensuring that the voices of individuals and communities are heard and represented in the political process. As the European Pirate Party, we recognize the importance of civil society in the European Union and its member states and are committed to strengthening the values that underpin it.
At the heart of our mission is a commitment to the fundamental values of the European Union, as set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. We believe that respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities such as LGBT+, are non-negotiable principles that must be upheld and defended at all times.
To achieve this goal, we call on the EU to work closely with civil society organizations across Europe and beyond to ensure that these fundamental values are respected and promoted in all aspects of EU policymaking and decision-making. We believe that civil society should have a strong voice in shaping EU policy. The EU should actively seek out and listen to the voices of individuals and communities that are traditionally underrepresented in the political process.
Furthermore, we believe that the EU has a responsibility to promote these values not only within its own institutions and member states, but also in its relations with other countries and international organizations. We believe that the EU should lead by example by demonstrating its commitment to these values in its foreign policy and by standing up for them in countries and regions where they are under threat.
Citizen participation and open government - democracy add-on for Europe
The Pirates advocate a directly elected Citizens' Convention tasked with drafting a new EU treaty that clarifies and replaces the current treaties and addresses the need for democratic reform within the Union, provided it is approved by the citizens of the Union through a referendum.
The current EU legislative process is dominated by the executive (the European Commission) at the expense of the legislature (the European Parliament). The Pirates want to change the balance of power in the European institutions in favor of the legislative branch.
Direct democracy at EU level, i.e. EU-wide referendums on constitutional amendments and law referendums initiated by citizens, should be part of the new constitution. Citizens should have the right both to repeal existing laws and to initiate new laws.

Addition to citizenship for Europe
CEEP PPEU
We, the European Pirates, see ourselves as European citizens. However, European citizenship is currently just an idea. The Pirates want to turn this idea into reality. With European citizenship, we can be more than the French, Germans and Swedes. We can be citizens with a set of common rights in every country of the Union. We will be able to issue European passports that allow every European citizen to be recognized as part of a concept that is bigger than their own country and in line with the ideal of a borderless world.
The Pirates want to open discussions and organize workshops to achieve these goals.
The European Pirate Party believes that everyone in the European Union should have the right to genuine EU citizenship. This citizenship should be accompanied by an EU passport and physical and digital documents that are recognized as European citizenship throughout the EU.
We believe that genuine European citizenship is essential to ensure that all people in the EU have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their country of origin. It is also an important step towards a more united and cohesive Europe, where everyone feels a sense of belonging and is a valuable member of the community.
Shaping political participation innovatively
The Pirates want citizens to have a more direct and significant influence on the political debate and decision-making process, both individually and collectively.
The European Parliament should set up an e-participation tool. Citizens should have the opportunity to publicly discuss legislative proposals, propose amendments and support (or vote against) proposed changes online.
We want to reform the EU Citizens' Initiative. The data requirements should be reduced. The European Commission should also deal with unsuccessful but interesting initiatives.
Petitioners with a large number of supporters have the right to be heard in person. The European Parliament should regularly open its doors to citizens so that they can put forward their proposals and concerns directly in a joint plenary session with Members of the European Parliament and the European Commission. These sessions should also be open to citizens participating remotely via the internet or social media.
European citizens must be able to use the information provided by the various European administrative processes
CEEP	Common European

European elections
CEEP PPEU
to seek, use and exchange information. In this way, they can understand and participate in
life in our European democracy. The social costs of participation must be kept as low as possible.
Open government
The European Union will join the Open Government Partnership. This multilateral initiative aims to promote open government, empower citizens, fight corruption and use new technologies to strengthen governance.
Promoting the participation of civil society
We are convinced that the participation of civil society is crucial for a healthy and vibrant democracy. We are therefore committed to promoting and supporting the work of non- governmental organizations (NGOs) throughout the EU. To achieve this, we propose to raise public awareness of the importance of civil society participation and to encourage greater participation through education and information programs.
Clear regulation of NGOs
We propose to advocate for clear and fair regulations for NGOs operating in the EU, with a focus on transparency and accountability. We also propose to facilitate the establishment and funding of NGOs in the EU.
Tax incentives for gifts
To encourage more organizations to become involved in social and environmental causes, we believe that donations to non-governmental organizations working for the common good should be given special tax status in all EU Member States.
Effective interaction with European institutions
NGOs need access to information on pending legislation in order to interact effectively with the European institutions. We propose that EU-registered NGOs have access to the actual text and additional information that allows them to put the legislation into context. This will ensure that all stakeholders have a seat at the table and have access to the latest developments.
Promoting the good work of NGOs
We will strive to promote and raise awareness of the important work that NGOs are already doing across the EU. By highlighting their successes, we want to encourage more people to get involved and support their efforts. We recognize the important role that NGOs play in areas such as environmental, social and environmental protection.

justice and human rights. We are therefore determined to support their efforts and work
together towards a fairer and more sustainable society.
Combating corruption and curbing corporate lobbying
The influence of money on politics is one of the biggest corruption risks in the EU and a threat to its democratic foundations. Political decisions are not made in the best interests of all citizens if corporate interests are allowed to dominate.
Disclosure and containment of external influence on political decisions
In order to protect the democratic process and make decision-making more transparent, the Pirates are calling for the influence of interest groups and lobbyists on political decisions to be disclosed. Lobbying activities should be as transparent as possible. This can be achieved by making the existing lobby register mandatory and linking it to an open calendar on the Internet. Every EU citizen should be able to see who the elected representative met with, what the purpose of the meeting was and what happened there. The process should be based on a multi-level control system, which is necessary for a reliable democracy. In addition, a legislative footprint should be published. Everyone involved in policy-making must disclose their meetings with lobbyists and the written contributions they receive. All draft laws and amendments must be traceable back to their original authors.
Enforceable ethical rules and a supervisory mechanism for lobbyists will be introduced. These are intended to prevent lobbyists from exerting undue influence.
Prevention of conflicts of interest
Public officials (including special advisers to the Commission) and elected representatives (including rapporteurs) must not allow themselves to be unduly influenced by private interests in the performance of their public duties.
Conflicts of interest can arise from sideline activities and previous jobs, but also from cases of revolving door deals in which Members of the European Parliament, Commissioners or civil servants take on new jobs in the private sector.
Appropriate rules must be established to ensure that the public officials concerned have no conflicts of interest, that interests are declared and that misconduct is sanctioned. The codes of conduct of the European Parliament and the European Commission need to be reformed. Effective transparency and ethics rules are needed for intergroups and other cross-party groups involving MEPs and lobbyists. An independent body should monitor compliance with the rules and impose sanctions where necessary. Comprehensive rules to limit the "revolving door" phenomenon must be adopted.
CEEP	Common European

Re-democratization of the input process
CEEP PPEU
Business interests must no longer be allowed to dominate political expertise. The Commission must introduce effective safeguards against corporate capture of expert and advisory groups, technology platforms and EU agencies. As a disproportionate number of meetings with EU officials are dedicated to big business, the number of these meetings should be reduced. More time should be spent actively seeking input from citizens, SMEs and other currently under-represented stakeholders.
Financing of political campaigns
All European political parties must use transparent bank accounts for campaign funds. The authority that supervises European political parties must have effective auditing and sanctioning instruments at its disposal.
Transparency and protection of whistleblowers
Transparency gives the powerless the power to control the powerful. The Pirates believe that transparency is necessary so that the public can make democratic decisions.
Protection of whistleblowers
The Pirates are committed to general and comprehensive whistleblower legislation to protect all individuals who expose problems that are in the public interest, including abuse of rights, unlawful activities and maladministration. We strongly believe that whistleblowers must be equally able to report internally, to a competent authority or to the media in order to ensure freedom of expression and citizens' right to information. The right to report information anonymously should be introduced.
Transparency of the public sector
The public sector, including private bodies working on behalf of a public institution, must be transparent and publish information as open data by default, without applying restrictions on its reuse. The transparency of legislation must be improved, especially in the Council and trilogues. Public bodies should be obliged to document information on decision-making processes. Authorities and representatives should be obliged to keep records and proactively publish information such as agendas, minutes of meetings, documents from third parties, such as contributions from lobbyists, and information justifying decisions.
The principle of transparency should apply to all public institutions, including the Court of Justice, the permanent representations of the Member States and the rotating national presidencies of the Council.

Defense policy & Cybersecurity
CEEP PPEU
The European Union must be enabled to defend its security interests while making a greater contribution to global security. The EU must formulate common guidelines and build the necessary capabilities to achieve this. The necessary military autonomy of Member States must not be misused to harm the common European spirit of cooperation. The Pirates support the integration of the currently separate national armed forces, with the long-term goal of creating a common European army under sufficient democratic control.
Our goal is to stabilize fragile states and contain the outbreak of conflict, because this instability is a security problem for the entire international community. In view of the increasingly unstable global security situation, the Pirates are committed to an efficient domestic arms industry. This goes hand in hand with efforts to improve the exchange of information on decisions and denials of arms export licenses in order to ensure a coherent EU arms export policy and increased support for countries that share the fundamental values of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Pirates take an interdisciplinary approach that considers multiple perspectives on countering hybrid threats and adapting to disruptive geopolitical changes. Our aim is to strengthen Europe's resilience against current and future threats from hybrid warfare, disinformation, cyber-attacks and economic coercion. Our current dependencies on fragile and often hostile authoritarian states for energy supplies, critical raw materials and general supply chains must be sustainably reduced. The Pirates want clear and transparent criteria and selection procedures for the evaluation of suppliers and their compliance with international law and human rights.
Pirates oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and support the dismantling of the world's nuclear, biological and chemical arsenals. Pirates support initiatives to ban the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems in kinetic and digital warfare while preserving our European capacity to research and develop new technologies.

Drugs and Addiction policy
CEEP PPEU
The "war on drugs" has failed. Prohibition ties up resources and causes immense costs. Unnecessary prosecution and sentencing of users of psychoactive substances not only harms society by constantly increasing police and judicial expenditure, but also pushes marginalized people into illegality and to the margins of society instead of regulating substance use outside a black market. This strengthens the black market and organized crime. Many EU member states are planning to re-evaluate, legalize or decriminalize cannabis, which can only be a first step towards a "New Drug and Addiction Policy". Drug policy should first and foremost be health policy and take into account the social and economic factors that promote drug use and addiction. A world without drugs in complete abstinence is unattainable. However, access to relevant information on drug use is essential to ensure both the freedom and safety of the individual. The state should only intervene to regulate if it is based on scientific evidence about the dangerousness of the substance/addiction.
The European Pirate Party believes that drug and addiction policies should be based on scientific evidence and prioritize individual autonomy and public health. The party supports a revision of the UN drug conventions and their transposition into EU law to create an evidence-based drug policy that prioritizes public health and harm reduction. The party believes that measures to reduce the negative consequences of drug use should take precedence over punitive measures.
These policies could include measures such as decriminalizing drug use and possession, expanding access to evidence-based treatment and regulating drugs to ensure safety and quality.
The Pirates are therefore calling for the EU to advocate a revision and, if necessary, termination of the UN conventions on psychoactive substances in order to achieve a scientifically sound view. Cannabis and other substances should be removed from the list of illegal drugs. The EU should create a framework that facilitates a science-based approach, including sharing information and contributing to research on psychoactive substances. This will make it possible to research and implement treatments with these substances (e.g. for the treatment of cancer, ADHD or Long Covid).
The EU must create a framework that encourages Member States to decriminalize, legalize and regulate cannabis and other substances in order to curb the black market, better protect consumers and minors and respect the philosophy of the free EU internal market. It takes measures to regulate legal substances that are particularly harmful to health, such as alcohol and tobacco, and to ensure health, youth and consumer protection, for example by banning advertising and restricting lobbying. One of the Pirates' top priorities is harm reduction measures for drug users. The European Union should promote the introduction of harm reduction services such as drug control services, drug consumption rooms and substitution therapy programs.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
The European Pirate Party argues that these services are essential for reducing the harms
associated with drug use, such as overdose deaths and the spread of blood-borne diseases. We believe that these services can help to reduce the stigma associated with drug use and support people seeking help for their drug use.
The European Pirate Party supports the regulation of cannabis for personal use in the EU. We believe that criminalizing the personal use of cannabis is ineffective, disproportionately harms marginalized groups and diverts resources from more pressing public health needs. The party advocates for evidence-based cannabis policies that prioritize harm reduction, including the regulation of the production, distribution and sale of cannabis to ensure safety and quality.
The European Pirate Party supports the legalization of psychedelic-assisted therapies. We believe that patients should have the right to access these treatments under medical supervision and that they should be regulated to ensure safety and efficacy. The Pirate Party supports the development of evidence-based policies aimed at expanding access to psychedelic-assisted therapies and promoting research into the therapeutic potential of these substances.
The European Pirate Party supports a common European alcohol and tobacco policy focused on harm reduction. We believe that public health should be a priority and policies should be evidence-based and aim to reduce harm to individuals and communities. We advocate measures such as education campaigns that promote the responsible use of alcohol and tobacco, discourage excessive consumption and ban advertising and marketing.
We are committed to sensible regulation of gambling in the EU. This includes the principle of informed choice, in which players should receive information about how each game works, the house edge, the risk of loss and the costs of the game.

Education, culture, research & free knowledge
CEEP PPEU
Broader public access to information, knowledge and culture is a prerequisite for the social, technological and economic development of our society. However, it is hindered by artificial information monopolies that are supposed to motivate creators and inventors to produce more. In reality, the only beneficiaries of these monopolies are the large corporations. The system as a whole is failing to achieve its intended goals. This failure manifests itself in many forms, including the frequent harassment of individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by collecting societies, the privatization of profits from publicly funded works or the loss of orphan works. We are faced with attempts to create new copyright restrictions for AI-generated content.
Our goal is to create an environment in which the motivation to create goes hand in hand with freedom of information. These challenges require a thorough reform of copyright law and systemic changes in the public sector.
Culture
Promotion of common goods and free culture
We will work to ensure that trade agreements include provisions that support the use and development of open formats and free/liberal open source software and promote the mutual recognition of licensing models such as Creative Commons.
The creation of common goods such as free software, free cultural goods, open patent tools and free and open educational material must be promoted and legally protected.
The existing cultural heritage is digitized as far as possible and made available to the public free of charge.
Free culture is an essential basis for the education and creativity of society. We promote artistic activities and cultural diversity in order to create a rich educational and creative environment for current and future generations.
Reform of copyright law
The European Pirate Party is committed to copyright reform that is comprehensive and fair. We strive for a copyright system that reflects the changing landscape of the digital age and promotes a fairer society.
We believe in creating a fair system that allows creators to receive remuneration for their work while ensuring that the public has access to valuable resources. We advocate for the abolition of information monopolies, which are supposed to motivate creators to produce more works. In reality, only a few benefit from this, while the market as a
CEEP	Common European

European elections
CEEP PPEU
Failure as a whole. Our aim is to create an environment in which the motivation to create
goes hand in hand with freedom of information.
Copying, storing, using and making literary and artistic works available for non-commercial purposes must not only be legalized, but also protected by law. Everyone should be able to enjoy and share our cultural heritage without the threat of legal action or censorship.
The duration of the commercial monopoly granted by copyright law should be further shortened. Derivative works must always be permitted, with the exceptions explicitly listed in the law and allowing only minimal room for interpretation. Freedom of information must be safeguarded through the right to link: Hyperlinks are a fundamental building block of the World Wide Web and must never constitute copyright infringement. Remixing, parodies, quotations and sampling should be excluded from the exclusive right of the commercial copyright monopoly. Non-commercial file sharing should be allowed.
Monopolies in the areas of information and culture must be prevented. The Pirates strictly reject the creation of additional layers of copyright restrictions for AI-generated results - such as AI-generated texts, paintings and other works. The state should only allow or maintain exclusive rights for intangible goods by law if they are in the public interest.
Exclusive rights must be limited in time; neither their duration nor their scope may be extended retroactively.
The European collecting societies must ensure comprehensive transparency, fair participation rights for their members and fair contractual conditions for artists.
Free knowledge and education
An educated and critically thinking population is necessary to maintain a functioning democracy, prosperity and social cohesion. We strive for universal access to quality education throughout the EU, enabling people's personal development regardless of their social and economic background.
The education system must provide citizens with all the essential skills for an independent and creative life in the information society. We want to improve people's critical thinking through education.
The European Pirate Party wants to create a system that promotes cross-border education and makes it accessible to all students and education workers in the European Union. The mobility of students and teachers is a beneficial way to spread educational knowledge throughout Europe and combat the underdevelopment of national education systems.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
Free access to knowledge and information is of fundamental importance and must be
promoted and guaranteed in the education system. Educational institutions should make greater use of learning resources that are available under free licenses without copying restrictions. The availability of educational media under free licenses for all is essential for barrier-free access to education, both within and outside the borders of the EU.
We support the digitization of educational institutions and the publication of documents held in public libraries and archives across the EU.
We see innovation as the key to the development of our cultural and intellectual wealth. We support the education of citizens and students about their right to information and free formats and free software in all types of educational institutions. We are against maintaining vendor lock-in in favor of the leading producers of digital solutions.
Media freedom and pluralism
Free and independent media are the foundation of healthy and well-functioning democracies. In recent years, however, we have seen attempts to paralyze free media by state authorities, attacks and cases of spying on journalists, and mergers of media houses affecting the European media landscape. EU citizens have the right to receive impartial and pluralistic media content.
We support efforts to harmonize minimum rules and guarantees to protect media freedom and media pluralism in the EU. We see strict rules on ownership structures and funded content as key to preventing an unfair distribution of state economic resources. We need tools to evaluate media market concentration and assess the risks arising from economic transactions that further undermine pluralism in the media market.
CEEP	Common European

Patents
Patents in the information age
Patents are often an obstacle to innovation rather than an incentive. The patenting of knowledge in areas such as genetics and biotechnology as well as software makes this process a concrete threat to the future of our society.
Monopolies on plants and seeds and costly litigation over often trivial patents are already showing that both innovators and consumers are paying the price. Patent law needs to be reformed or replaced with an approach that enables a sharing economy and more accessible and sustainable markets, rather than further hindering innovation.
Harmonizing patents with the common good
Patents are not there to allow large companies to stifle competition through an ever-growing flood of trivial and excessive patents. We therefore want to stop the ongoing and increasing abuse of patents.
Patents in the information society
Success in the information society no longer depends solely on technological inventions, but also on the development of knowledge and the exchange of information. The attempt to regulate these factors via the patent system is diametrically opposed to our demand for freedom of knowledge and culture.
Patents should never be granted for "inventions" that are trivial and insignificant, such as computer programs, business models or works of nature. This type of patent hinders the development of the information society and leads to a privatization of the commons.
Innovation must be fairly rewarded, but this does not necessarily require the granting of monopoly privileges that harm innovation and negatively affect access to vital goods.
The EU, its Member States and other developed countries should not force less developed countries to accept patent provisions that could adversely affect their basic needs, health, education or development opportunities.
Patents, pharmaceuticals and health
We oppose the frequent abuse of patent privileges, such as the introduction of unauthorized changes to drugs with expiring patent protection. Anti-competitive practices, such as paying competitors to delay the marketing of generics, should be actively prevented.
CEEP	Common European

pharmaceutical innovation in order to gradually replace patents in this area. We want to break the direct link between the remuneration of advances and the price of the final product to ensure that medicines are affordable for all.
Universities and research institutes should be able to conduct scientific research for health and medicine without being burdened by patents.
International regulation of intellectual monopolies
The Pirates are seeking a revision of the TRIPS Agreement in favor of restricting exclusive rights to intangible goods. We want similar restrictions to apply to all trade agreements that may contain similar or even more far-reaching provisions on patents and copyrights.

Environment, climate and Energy
Goals
CEEP PPEU
We want to ensure that future generations have a basis for a life in freedom and dignity. A healthy environment, biodiversity, sustainable use of resources and equal and fair access to energy, food and water are fundamental prerequisites for this. To ensure a secure future, we want a rapid transition to a clean, circular economy that reduces its environmental impact to zero.
The environment and climate do not stop at borders. Energy also crosses borders in the EU internal energy market. We need to strengthen European coordination in order to overcome the energy and climate crisis. We want to create EU-wide standards that take transparency and verifiability into account in order to ensure effective implementation and prevent greenwashing.
Sustainability
The Pirates support the objectives and principles of the EU to protect water, air, soil and the natural environment for the benefit of all, including future generations.
Emissions must be minimized, existing pollution eliminated and natural habitats preserved and restored wherever possible. Voluntary measures by potential polluters are a preferred method. However, they must be closely monitored as they often fail to achieve the targets.
A strict polluter pays principle must be introduced to increase the pressure to take more precautionary and preventive measures. Environmental problems must be tackled at source and not as an afterthought.
Biodiversity
Biodiversity loss is a problem related to climate change, but not only caused by it. Biodiversity is being lost at a rate that is unprecedented in our geological age, and yet the problem is not receiving adequate attention.
This dramatic loss is not only tragic in itself. It could potentially lead to a collapse in global food production and have further negative effects.
We welcome the ambitious targets set at EU and UN level (in particular the EU Nature Restoration Act, the UN Oceans Treaty and the Montreal COP15 targets) in terms of species habitat protection and restoration, funding, mandatory measures and transparency of implementation.
CEEP	Common European

Transparent data
The public has the right to simple, timely and reliable access to environmental data and the decisions based on it. This information should also include methods for monitoring and investigation.
Scientific reports and specifications that form the basis for administrative and legal decisions must come from independent experts. Participation in decision-making processes must be comprehensive.
Consistent and effective rules
All environmental legislation must include a proper impact assessment and require a minimum of bureaucracy. Implementation must be closely monitored.
The regulations must not require registration in each individual EU country. Central registration should be sufficient to ensure that access to the common market for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is not hindered.
Currently, different national regulations make it difficult to work in the area of sustainability. The EU should strive for a common system for the labeling and recycling of products.
Circular economy
Conserving and reusing resources through recycling is the key to a sustainable economy. To ensure the long-term availability of materials, the EU must introduce a circular economy based on the cradle-to-cradle principle, which takes into account the entire life cycle of a product and makes the reduction, reuse and recycling of materials part of the design.
The export of waste (sometimes disguised as used products) to third countries for substandard recycling or disposal must be effectively restricted to ensure that the materials are not lost or destroyed.
Climate
The measures adopted as part of the European Green Deal strategy must be in line with and go beyond the original European and international climate protection commitments.
Climate - No time to lose
Most of the technologies required to achieve the climate protection targets have already been developed and are already in use. The task now is to introduce them on a large scale.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
The Pirates want to create the legal conditions for these technologies to be used as quickly
as possible by creating incentives for climate-neutral technologies and removing incentives for climate-damaging technologies.
All subsidies for climate-damaging activities must be phased out. This also includes the financing or provision of collateral for the financing of climate-damaging projects abroad.
Climate - effectively stopping carbon leakage
The greenhouse gas emissions for imported goods (i.e. the emissions generated during electricity generation at the production site) should be attributed to the importing countries. Imported goods must be taxed to take account of the displacement of greenhouse gas emissions and to promote more climate-friendly production of goods imported into the EU.
Climate - not just CO2
CO2 is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, but other emissions must also be controlled. Highly climate-impacting gases must be reduced, replaced and contained. All emissions of climate-impacting gases should be controlled and reduced.
Climate - reversing emissions
The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is already too high and must be reduced. We want to encourage projects that capture greenhouse gases and use them as raw materials for products and chemicals. The use of such projects for greenwashing must be prevented and they must not generate certificates that enable emissions elsewhere.
The expansion of natural carbon sinks should also be considered.
Climate - Prepare yourself
Even if we could stop greenhouse gas emissions now, the climate crisis would not end immediately. We will have to expect changes in weather patterns and precipitation as well as rising sea levels. Critical infrastructure such as food supply, transportation and energy supply will be affected. Unfavorable weather events can lead to natural disasters. To mitigate these impacts, we need to prepare our infrastructure, cities, coastlines, agriculture and forestry for the ongoing changes.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024

CEEP PPEU
Energy
We want to create a sustainable and reliable energy infrastructure that offers as much participation and transparency as possible.
With the increasingly important role of renewable energies, the number of privately owned electricity generation is exploding. Former consumers are becoming a mix of consumers and producers; energy cooperatives are taking local supply into their own hands. The legal framework must be adapted to this new situation, in which the market no longer consists of just a few large companies.
Our future development, including the development of a circular economy, depends on energy. We need to ensure that we have clean, reliable and abundant energy.
Energy - Becoming sustainable
The transition from fossil resources to sustainable and clean energy sources must be completed. Energy procurement must not conflict with other environmental goals or agriculture for food production.
The technologies with the lowest environmental impact must be prioritized and their construction promoted.
Energy - Becoming resilient
Recent events have shown the negative effects of dependence on energy imports in times of crisis. The EU has all the necessary technologies and resources at home to build an energy system without critical dependencies on third countries. We want to build and maintain European production capacities for all the components needed for the transition to a green economy.
Energy - Becoming efficient
The principle of "energy efficiency first" must be at the heart of all European policies. To achieve this goal, we want to support energy-efficient technologies and the transition of the energy sectors to electricity as the primary form of energy. Eliminating energy conversion steps will also eliminate many losses. The electrification of transportation, heating and many industrial processes will reduce the amount of primary energy required, even though the demand for electricity will increase.
Energy - as local as possible, as centralized as necessary
The European electricity grid efficiently balances out temporary fluctuations in supply and demand and prevents regions from getting into difficulties in the event of local supply problems. However, it is not efficient when it comes to preventing significant

transporting the energy for an entire country across the continent. This would lead to
bottlenecks, which could result in major outages.
First and foremost, generation and demand should be coordinated locally as far as possible, and the European grid should serve as a safety net.
CEEP	Common European

Economy and Finances
CEEP PPEU
Our economic program aims to support sustainable long-term development and a general improvement in the quality of life and to promote a competitive, fair and innovative economic environment. In this context, we believe it is necessary to consider a broader range of economic metrics in addition to immediate gross productivity. Such metrics must capture the development of long-term economic opportunities, prosperity, environmental and social sustainability and successful cooperation across the EU.
Competitive economic environment
The environment for all economic activities must promote resilience and competition and encourage and enforce transparency. This incentivizes social progress in a sustainable, fair and democratic way. Pirates aim to protect the individual, preserve opportunity and promote individual autonomy and well-being by distributing and deconcentrating public and private power. Competitive markets provide fertile ground for entrepreneurship.
Competition policy should aim to prevent excessive market concentration and monopolistic practices that hinder the entry of new firms. The promotion of entrepreneurship, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups, leads to job creation, innovation and economic dynamism, thus contributing to overall prosperity. An effective competition standard should go beyond consumer welfare and be science-based. Rather than sanctioning the abuse of a dominant position, competition policy should focus on preventing market power. The authorities responsible for enforcing competition should be adequately resourced and given institutional support and a sufficient legal mandate.
Ideally, the competition authority must be independent and protected from direct political influence.
Trade
The Pirates believe that trade and cooperation are a path to development and shared prosperity. However, we see many challenges in the current trade environment. At the same time, trade agreements have been abused in the past to empower private companies at the expense of public courts, exploit communities and promote cronyism.
We propose basic principles for international trade. For trade agreements, the European Parliament must ratify the agreement, which must be negotiated as transparently as possible, including public hearings and full access to information. Trade should expand our markets and allow for more competition. Therefore, trade agreements should not grant more or less hidden special advantages. The ultimate goal of international trade agreements is the positive development of all parties involved. Therefore, we must always demand that our partners comply with at least the most basic working conditions and
CEEP	Common European

to ensure that they pay for common externalities that harm us all via the carbon border
adjustment mechanism and similar instruments.
Trade is also an economic and political instrument. We support economic sanctions against authoritarian regimes, especially those that actively undermine European security and commit crimes against humanity. These sanctions should be aimed precisely at damaging the wealth of governing elites, hampering the offensive and prosecutorial capacities of these regimes and avoiding the suffering of ordinary citizens as much as possible. We should not supply weapons and surveillance technologies to authoritarian regimes.
In recent years, protectionism has also increased and free trade in critical technological areas such as microchips or renewable energy technologies has been restricted. We believe that Europe should achieve maximum strategic autonomy in these areas and that we need to reduce our over-dependence on authoritarian regimes. The path to this autonomy and prosperity is through trade with new partners, research, technological excellence and cooperation. Trade wars have repeatedly proven to be detrimental.
Taxation
The tax mix should create an environment in which the external effects of economic activities are fully internalized in order to promote an entrepreneurial environment and a society that develops well in the long term.
To achieve this, we propose shifting more of the tax burden from labor to capital. To facilitate this, tax harmonization between European jurisdictions should be further developed. This should include the strategic allocation of capital for tax avoidance and the deliberate concealment of corporate structure (including public entities). We should focus on strengthening the decision-making power and interests of local communities in relation to their local tax structure while creating a pan-European harmonization framework. We are not s e e k i n g to standardize tax rates or tax base definitions, but merely a framework for a common approach. We will support global coordination of taxation, especially with regard to international companies.
Financial markets and multinational corporations
The regulation, monitoring and taxation of financial markets should promote investment in long-term development strategies that are environmentally and socially sustainable. The environment should discourage financial dominance, capital concentration and short-term profit-oriented reallocations (e.g. share buybacks). Speculative investments should be more strongly discouraged and more transparent.
CEEP	Common European

European budget rules
Budgetary policy is an essential instrument of economic policy. The current budgetary rules aim to avoid budget deficits and prevent Member States from reacting in times of crisis.
We propose deleting these and replacing them with long-term assessments of the sustainability of the budget in order to avoid excessive budgetary imbalances.
This will enable Member States to pursue an investment policy despite the defense, environmental and social challenges of our time and to promote a balance between savings and consumption, which will foster a dynamic internal market.
European economic integration
The next steps in European economic integration should support labor mobility, equality and broad economic development in all European regions. In addition, the economic development of physical and institutional infrastructure, especially in cross-border regions, should be further supported.
Cryptocurrency
We, the Pirates, see the potential of cryptocurrencies and that they can play a positive role in economic development. We want to protect cash because of its anonymity, including digital cash.

The cornerstone of our foreign policy is the focus on like-minded democracies and alliances in the Euro-Atlantic area, with membership of the European Union at the forefront.
Pirates seek to build and develop relationships with democratic partners around the world and support democracy and cooperation as a source of sustainable peace in the world. We prefer cooperation to the pursuit of our own interests.
We must defend the Internet as a means of freely exchanging and obtaining information about the real world and as a tool for promoting human relations.
In view of current global demographic and economic developments, the Pirates are striving for ecological sustainability in line with international agreements.
European policy
The Pirates support the active role of the EU in promoting peace and stability in the world and the deepening of the common security and defense policy. We promote changes that lead to a strengthening of the elements of direct democracy and want to improve the transparency and democratic control of the EU institutions.
The Pirates want to strengthen the role of the European Parliament as the only directly elected EU institution in decision-making on EU policy issues. We welcome the outcome of the Conference on the Future of Europe and support its full implementation. We support efforts to give the European Parliament the right to make proposals so that it can act as a genuine legislative body. The Pirates want to replace the current unanimous decision- making in the Council of the EU with the introduction of qualified majority voting, particularly in foreign and fiscal policy and in matters relating to the common budget.
Vetoes by nation states seriously undermine the EU's ability to respond quickly and effectively to international challenges and threats.
Decisions that can be better taken at national, regional or local level should not be taken at EU level. Equal and easy access to
CEEP	Common European

CEEP PPEU
The provision of truthful and non-misleading information to all citizens is a basic prerequisite
for legitimate democratic decision-making.
The EU needs a functioning and jointly implemented policy in a number of areas. The EU and its member states must do more to promote education, science and research. In the EU, the Pirates want to defend the free movement of people, goods, services and information and minimize bureaucracy and centralization. We see the promotion of digital freedoms as the core of pirate policy at European level.
The Pirates support the enlargement of the European Union to include further states that meet the conditions and criteria for accession. The EU should deepen relations with candidate countries through increased economic, political and cultural cooperation.
International Affairs
Pirates seek to reduce the funding of authoritarian regimes through reciprocal trade and to combat trade associated with human rights abuses, forced and child labor.
We want to solve global environmental problems and disasters together at international level. We reject multilateral international treaties that enforce dysfunctional monopolies and patents at the expense of civil rights and human freedom. We will advocate the revision of international conventions that only have negative consequences and are only maintained for historical reasons.
Pirates view multinational corporations as part of the international security environment and will hold them accountable for the impact of their actions on the global security situation.
The European Union should be a political actor that protects European and international whistleblowers. They should be able to claim the right to political asylum in the EU.
The Pirates want to pay particular attention to the stabilization of conflict hotspots and fragile states, as their instability is a source of problems for the entire international community. The resolution of conflicts must be based on respect for international law.
Migration
The Pirates recognize that immigration has always been an integral part of the European community and has contributed greatly to our common cultural heritage and the development of Europe. Migration is first and foremost a social issue and must respect the human dignity and rights of all migrants and asylum seekers.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
The Pirates want to build a prosperous and dynamic Europe that is better prepared for the
future challenges and demands of the labor market. Given the glaring labor shortage in Europe, an effective immigration system is essential to ensure the functioning of our communities and economies.
We call on all member states to take in refugees and asylum seekers according to their capacities. A European refugee and asylum policy based on solidarity that does not leave the individual member states alone with the financial, logistical and administrative efforts is crucial.
The Pirates are convinced that the best way to ensure the safety of future asylum seekers is through effective conflict prevention and combating climate change.
We reject the criminalization of those who provide humanitarian aid to people in need.
An ethical and efficient immigration system
The Pirates are convinced that migration must be well managed so that everyone benefits. We call for a comprehensive immigration system that recognizes the skills and talents of each individual. Any discrimination based on religion, ethnicity, race, gender and sexuality is contrary to our core values.
It is crucial to ensure fair and transparent recruitment of migrant workers and international students so that all can reach their full potential equally.
We recognize that immigration can bring challenges and are committed to addressing them responsibly and effectively. We insist that immigration must be addressed holistically and with a commitment to promoting a culture of integration, cooperation and respect for European values.
The Pirates are calling for a common European immigration policy that:
 enables legal immigration to the European labor market while ensuring ethical and transparent recruitment of migrant workers and international students,
 protects the rights of migrant workers and international students and promotes their participation in the everyday life of the host societies,
 ensures fair representation of the interests of migrant workers from non-EU countries within the framework of temporary labor migration programs,
 evaluates the language skills and other given abilities of the applicants positively in the procedure,

 recognizes certain certificates and professional qualifications in a simplified
manner,

 allows Member States to adapt their requirements according to their situation and needs,
 is sensitive and does not discriminate against the religion, ethnicity, race, gender and sexuality of migrants.

Right of asylum
Asylum system
The Pirates are committed to a comprehensive revision of European refugee and asylum policy.
The Pirates firmly believe that European refugee and asylum policy must be based on respect for human rights and international law. All EU states are obliged to support refugees and asylum seekers, as they are legally bound to do so by international treaties. All EU states must adhere to the provisions of the Geneva Refugee Convention and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The Pirates condemn the criminalization of all people and organizations that help people seeking protection. The criminalization of humanitarian aid fundamentally undermines the principle of legal certainty and thus the rule of law in the EU.
The EU border protection agency Frontex must comply with international law, just like the member states. The accusations made by Frontex of violating the ban on deportation must be taken seriously.
We must work on a non-discriminatory reform of the asylum system that is respected by all Member States.
The Pirates are calling for a common European asylum policy that implements the following:
 reintroduces the principle of the first safe country of asylum as the decisive factor for determining the place where the asylum procedure takes place and where the asylum seeker must stay,
 |promotes the possibility of family reunification initially for those whose application has been approved;|
 establishes a system of mutual processing of asylum applications, whereby any application can be made directly to the EU, while it is up to the Member States to decide whether to accept asylum seekers into their territory,
 underlines the principle of solidarity between Member States as a guiding principle in the management of humanitarian crises,
 avoid the inhumane detention of asylum seekers and fast-track procedures at land borders and airports,
 ensures that asylum applications can be submitted from anywhere in the world so that refugees can be brought to the host country in a humane and safe manner.

Free software and open data
CEEP PPEU
Pirates support the promotion of software that can be used, analyzed, distributed and modified by anyone. Free/libre open source software is essential for the control of users over their own technical systems and contributes significantly to strengthening the autonomy and privacy of all users.
Free software, formats and protocols in public administration
Citizens' data must be processed, managed and secured using Free Software tools whenever possible. Proprietary software may only be used as long as Free Software cannot be used effectively for this specific purpose and the possibility of creating such software is not feasible.
Free software lowers administrative costs, promotes local technical support and significantly increases security, for example by allowing anyone to quickly check whether the software contains malicious, vulnerable or deceitful code. We will drive forward the transition of the public sector to Free Software so that there is no longer any dependence on specific providers.
Citizens and businesses must never be forced to use proprietary software when dealing with public administration or any other communication with their government. It must never be based on proprietary forms of communication that only work with specific, mostly non-free software. Instead, open, interoperable and vendor-neutral protocols and formats must be used.
Financing and development of free software
Free software, which often forms the basis for critical infrastructures, is usually maintained by a few volunteers in their spare time. We want to finance innovative open source projects and contribute to the development of free software. This can be done, for example, through direct funding and organized hackathons.
We also plan to encourage member state governments to set up their own Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). This will significantly improve the ability to create and collaborate on free software that can be (re)used across the Union.
Finally, the development of free and open source software must never be subject to the same obligations as the development of proprietary software, and its developers cannot be held liable for any damage caused by the free use of their work.
CEEP	Common European

European elections
Software provided by the government
CEEP PPEU
Software provided by the government, such as mobile ID cards, must work on free and open source operating systems, including those that are not installed by default or officially supported by device manufacturers, where technically possible. This functionality should not be artificially restricted.
Software versions for all major mobile platforms should also be made available.
Software that is developed with public funds must be open source - "public money, public code". However, if there is a valid reason for not disclosing the source code at a certain point in time - such as a potential threat to national security - the code must be published as soon as the reason no longer exists. We also suggest that the source code for such software be hosted by the OSPO of the relevant country using Git or similar software repositories.
To ensure the widest possible use and accessibility, we also recommend that governments provide their software with a copyleft license. The software should also be compatible with all major operating systems on the platform for which it was developed. In addition, web- based programs should be designed to be portable and compatible with all major free and open source browsers, preferably taking into account the web standards defined by the W3C.
Open data
Data is the basis for every decision in our society and there is now a colossal asymmetry between governments, large companies and individuals.
We seek a Freedom of Information Act at European level that stands for open and free access to all public data that is fully anonymized to respect individual privacy, shared in an open and standardized format, free of charge and easily accessible to everyone.
CEEP	Common European

Human rights in the digital age
CEEP PPEU
The European Pirate Party stands for the protection of fundamental rights in both the physical and digital world. We are against measures that aim to undermine the personal freedoms of individuals. The protection of fundamental freedoms has always played an important role in the Union's legal order. While significant progress has been made in extending the freedoms of Union citizens, the protection of fundamental rights in the digital world needs further consideration.
The right to internet access
Of course, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms should also apply in the digital world. Internet access enables us to participate in an increasingly digital society. While internet access has rapidly become the standard in the European Union, many are still unable to benefit from its potential.
We believe that the right to internet access should be effectively guaranteed throughout the EU in terms of coverage and quality. Digital transformation and progress should leave no one behind. Everyone should have access to affordable high-speed internet on favorable terms. The quality of internet access should be sufficient by today's standards to enable adequate participation in digital life.
Access should be possible without unreasonable difficulties, burdens or costs.
The right to privacy
Everyone should have the right to privacy, which includes the right of individuals to control their personal data and to be free from ubiquitous surveillance. As a fundamental human right, respect for privacy is essential to protect the interests of the individual and prevent abuse. Privacy includes the right to discretion and the right to remain anonymous online and offline.
Anonymity does not release anyone from responsibility for their actions.
People who feel constantly watched and monitored cannot exercise their rights freely and effectively and defend themselves against abuses. Surveillance, mistrust and fear run the risk of transforming our society into a community that is susceptible to the erosion of rights. We do not want to live in such a society. We believe in accountability in the collection and use of personal data and are committed to robust data protection laws that give individuals control over their personal data.
In order to protect our rights and freedoms and ensure the effectiveness of law enforcement, the Pirates demand that the storage of personal data be limited to persons suspected of committing or preparing a crime (targeted investigations). The Pirates want to abolish the practice of routine, automated and non-targeted data processing. We are committed to
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
a moratorium on new laws on mass surveillance or systematic data collection of the
population, be it about our communications, movement, internet use, biometric or other data.
In particular, we defend the right to the protection of digital data against measures that automatically search private chats, messages, emails or photos generally and indiscriminately for suspicious content (chat control). We defend the right to anonymous communication against mandatory age checks. Publicly accessible spaces should be free from biometric mass surveillance, including biometric identification and automated behavioral monitoring. Pirates oppose the automated profiling of people to categorize them into risk categories.
We reject the blanket and indiscriminate collection of traffic data (data retention). Everyone should have the right to use the internet without being tracked everywhere.
The Pirates oppose the exchange of personal data with countries that do not provide effective safeguards. Such transfers can only be allowed in exceptional circumstances where there is an emergency and appropriate safeguards and restrictions apply.
Adequate protection against crime is an important responsibility of the state. We must ensure that this responsibility is fulfilled through an intelligent, rational and evidence-based security policy. We therefore want the European Fundamental Rights Agency to systematically examine all current and future surveillance powers and programs in terms of their effectiveness, costs, side effects, alternatives and their compatibility with our fundamental rights.
The Pirates support the funding of research by the EU. However, the frequent funding of surveillance and control technologies (such as iBorderCtrl) shows a clear intention to use such technologies to dismantle civil rights. We therefore argue that the EU should not fund technologies that interfere with fundamental rights, that human rights advocacy organizations and NGOs should be involved in the drafting of calls for proposals and the selection of applicants, and that all publicly funded project results should be fully disclosed.
Everyone should have the right to access key public services in the EU. The EU proposal on digital identity provides a gateway for easy access to services and public authorities with a single digital ID. Such a system should guarantee the independent processing of personal data and ensure that strict technical measures are taken to prevent manipulation and misuse by states or third parties. Such a system should respect the personal integrity of Union citizens.
Freedom of expression
Individuals have the right to express themselves online without fear of censorship or retribution. The right to freedom of expression shall be guaranteed without restriction to the extent that it does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
Large online platforms should respect legitimate online discourse and provide an open space
for people to express themselves.
It is now the case that states order the censorship of online dissent in order to suppress protests and evidence of restrictive policies. The use of such measures should only be permitted in extreme circumstances where there is a particular risk of harming the personal integrity of others, as long as these measures are proportionate and necessary to prevent legitimate harm, and not as a means of pursuing a government policy or curtailing rights.
Online platforms must take proportionate measures to tackle illegal content published online, with due regard to the interests of society and the rights of others.
We advocate the use of open source software, decentralized platforms and other software that facilitates the use of freedom of expression. We support better protection for whistleblowers and laws that protect freedom of the press and freedom of information.
Personal integrity
The interests of the individual must be protected from interference by authorities or companies. Personal identity must not be used as a tool for political or economic propaganda. Discriminatory algorithms and inappropriate disclosure of personal data are prohibited. Personal data may not be used for profiling purposes if clear behavioral and personal characteristics of individuals can be determined. Public authorities may not store or request personal data that is not essential or incompatible with the commissioned purpose.
Developments in the field of AI in recent years have led to an increasing dependence on this technology. While AI is a useful tool for humanity, it should not be used to undermine the freedoms and privileges of individuals. The development of AI should adhere to the highest ethical standards and exclude discriminatory bias or profiling. This area should be closely regulated to ensure that individual EU citizens benefit. Artificial intelligence should not limit the ability to make individual decisions.
The right to self-determination
We consider people's right to self-determination and self-determination to be a matter of course. We are committed to using the digital infrastructure to improve citizen participation in decision-making processes.
In order to guarantee the freedom of self-determination, states shall ensure that sufficient account is taken of the transparency and legitimacy of the electoral process. The
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024

Electoral secrecy must be ensured through suitable precautions. The influencing of the
electoral process by foreign actors is unacceptable.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024 European elections
CEEP PPEU
Network policy
The digital revolution has changed social and economic structures across Europe; free and equal access to the internet is now a basic prerequisite for participation in civil society.
Citizens should be able to access the internet anonymously.
The Pirates want to include the right to "digital participation" in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. We will support measures aimed at ensuring the ability of representative civil society to participate in multi-stakeholder forums. We will oppose any attempts by corporations, governments or intergovernmental bodies to take control of internet governance. The Internet is global, and attempts to divide it into disjointed parts are detrimental to fundamental rights.
Protection of freedom of expression on the Internet
Freedom of speech is the cornerstone of a democratic society. It must not be placed in the hands of private companies or algorithms. Very large online platform providers must not remove content from their platforms based solely on their own decision, unless it is obviously illegal or fraudulent content. The decision to remove content must be reserved for an independent public body such as a judge.
Online intermediaries should not be responsible for the actions of their users. The use of automatic upload filters to block online content should be prohibited, as they often lead to the deletion of legal content, including the documentation of human rights violations.
Net neutrality
Net neutrality is crucial to ensuring that the Internet remains free for all. We will not allow any traffic restrictions. In particular, any restriction or prioritization based on the type of content/service must be prohibited.
Traffic management measures may only be permitted for technical reasons and must be handled clearly and transparently.
Upgrading the network infrastructure
The Pirates strongly support the Europe-wide development of a modern communications infrastructure. Our goal is to give everyone in the EU access to broadband.
While the networks are being improved and modernized, monopolization of the infrastructure must be avoided.
Unlocking the network: a right to interoperability
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
Commercial social and messaging platforms are known for spying on their users, manipulating
them through advertising and censoring online communication. The Pirates want users who leave such platforms to have the right to take their contacts to an alternative service and stay in touch with them. The interoperability obligation for messaging services under the Digital Markets Act should be extended to social networks.
Security in the digital age
With the Internet of Things, computers have a direct and physical impact on our world (e.g. car or hospital technology). Devices and tools that are insecure and vulnerable to integrity and availability threats are increasingly endangering our lives and property. We cannot afford to have regular security disasters.
The Pirates want to oblige commercial device manufacturers to provide regular security updates for a reasonable period of time. If patches for critical security vulnerabilities are not made available within a reasonable period of time after their discovery, the commercial manufacturers should be held liable. If a manufacturer decides to abandon a product that is still widely used, the source code and development tools must be published so that the community can continue to maintain the product.
The authorities are obliged to disclose any vulnerabilities found or acquired. There must be no backdoors in encryption technology, as this would weaken and jeopardize the integrity and security of all systems.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024 European elections
Regional Development
CEEP PPEU
We are convinced that regional development is crucial for promoting economic growth and improving the quality of life of citizens. Regional policy has a direct impact on people's lives, especially as there are still significant social and economic disparities between European regions, both in the EU and in third countries. Regional development should be a priority in order to create a fairer and more united Europe, based on the principles of equity, participation and environmental responsibility.
Regions, and especially border regions, often face very specific challenges, such as environmental damage caused by climate change, deindustrialization due to the economic crisis, difficulties in accessing healthcare and education, and demographic changes.
Regional development should help European regions make the green transition. To ensure that policies are sustainable and environmentally sound, we support the funding of projects that promote the transition to a low-carbon economy while meeting climate targets.
In this sense, the goal of successful regional development is also ever greater cohesion between the various regions of Europe. Major projects such as the Green Transition can only succeed if all regions receive the appropriate support for their challenges.
Digital transition
We also recognize the importance of the digital transformation of European regions. The focus should be on promoting digital innovation in regional development. We therefore support connectivity projects that enable access to digital infrastructure, such as high-speed internet and telecommunications networks, in all regions.
Transportation
As European regions often cross borders, we also believe that regional policy plays an important role in the development of regional transport projects. We therefore support transnational transport projects that improve connections to and within less developed regions, such as high-speed railroads.
Cross-border cooperation
To achieve this, we call for an increase in the EU budget for regional development to help regions reduce disparities and promote cross-border cooperation. Supporting sustainable economic and social growth of European regions should be the EU's main area of investment. The funds earmarked for regional development should
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
should primarily be used for long-term investments, while separate funds for crisis
management should provide short-term crisis aid in times of need.
Targeted measures for urban and rural regions
CEEP PPEU
These measures should be promoted through activities designed for specific types of regions, where the EU should work closely with Member States. A solid urban agenda should help European cities and metropolitan regions to become greener and smarter, strengthen housing capacity and improve the quality of life in cities. Particular attention should be paid to the transnational coordination of measures for the development of rural areas.
Decentralization and empowerment
To enable bottom-up decision-making in our societies, regional authorities should be given more powers to develop their own local policies based on their unique strengths and resources. Regional authorities should also be more involved in the legislative process when it comes to their development. To this end, we encourage cooperation between local representatives within EU platforms dealing with regional policy. We also aim to channel public funds to regional authorities as much as possible so that they can be distributed to locally-led initiatives.
Given the limited administrative capacity of regional authorities, we understand the need to reduce the bureaucratic burden of accessing public funds and call for additional resources for technical assistance in the development and reporting of large-scale and innovative projects. Funding and its allocation to projects should be based on concrete data to enable evidence-based decision making.
Fair and transparent funding for more upgraded regions
However, this should not detract from the urgent need to improve the transparency of the final beneficiaries of public funds. This is crucial to avoid conflicts of interest, fraud and corruption. At regional level, project evaluation criteria and implementation requirements should be objective and transparent. The risk of misuse is particularly high for EU funds that are jointly managed by Member States, as there is no exchange of information between the regional, national and EU levels.
Therefore, we propose to use interoperable digital tools for budgetary control and to publish non-sensitive data on all public contracts, including project implementation reports. Only full transparency will allow the public and the media to follow the path of money in order to identify possible cases of misuse.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
We also believe that regional development policy must be guided by the principles of social
justice and inclusiveness. This means that the rules for the distribution of EU funds to the regions should always be in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the rule of law and the European Code of Conduct. All citizens should have equal access to the benefits of regional development policies, and these policies should aim to reduce inequalities and promote territorial and social cohesion.
Citizen participation as a guarantee for progress
Finally, regional development policy must be based on active citizen participation and democracy. This means involving citizens in the decision-making process and enabling them to shape the policies that affect their lives.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024 European elections
Social Affairs and Healthcare
CEEP PPEU
The human rights conventions require these services to be based on the principles of respect, equality and access.
All EU residents have the right to the highest possible quality of healthcare and health education, regardless of how healthcare systems are structured (private, public or mixed).
This includes preventive, curative and palliative healthcare as well as mental healthcare. It also includes the basic social determinants of health, such as safe food, drinking water, basic sanitation and adequate housing, safe and healthy working conditions and a healthy environment.
Adequate healthcare can only be guaranteed if healthcare workers are paid appropriately and sufficient equipment and medicines are available. The training and employment of a sufficient number of healthcare professionals is necessary to shorten waiting lists and keep healthcare professionals on the job.
The costs of healthcare should be borne either by the public purse, public health insurance or a combination of both. Health insurance should be compulsory, affordable for all EU citizens regardless of income level and coordinated between EU countries.
Patient availability and comfort
The Pirates demand equal access to healthcare for all EU residents, regardless of the resources available to a state, as well as support:
 No (direct or indirect) discrimination in access to healthcare, regardless of the resources available to a state.
 Health goods and services should be accessible to everyone. States must ensure that no one is hindered in accessing their right to health, including access to information on health and health services.
 Healthcare goods and services that are affordable for everyone, regardless of their income level.
 Health laws and policies that are designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with meaningful participation of affected people. All health systems must include an accountability framework, which should include access to effective judicial or other appropriate measures for violations of the right to health.
 Free access to prenatal care for all pregnant women, with a focus on physical and mental well-being.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
 Appropriate perinatal care
CEEP PPEU
 Free advice from public health nurses and doctors who monitor the physical and mental health and development of children in their families.
 Preventing and combating poverty. Poverty leads to poor health in children, e.g. through poor nutrition, inadequate housing, stress and feelings of inferiority.
 In order to ensure the mobility of nurses within the EU, all countries should adhere to the same minimum academic standards in training.
 Easier cross-border access to healthcare. Better opportunities for using healthcare systems abroad with cover from domestic health insurance.
 Cross-border healthcare should not lead to the implementation of measures that violate privacy, the decentralization of data or patients' control and consent over the use of their data.
 EU health card for the whole world: Negotiations on the validity of the European Health Insurance Card (Blue Card) in third countries.
Patents and technology
Reduce the number and duration of patents for medicinal products or at least avoid the administrative renewal of patents. Publicly funded medicines, including e.g. COVID-related vaccines, should be available under patent-free open source licenses.
The Pirates are calling for Europe to strengthen its sovereignty in the production of active ingredients and pharmaceuticals.
The Pirates are calling for Europe to improve its sovereignty in the manufacture and development of biomedical devices.
Apps and devices that measure biomedical data, including menstruation and fitness apps, should be fully compliant with the GDPR and should never be used for mass biometric surveillance.
The European Pirate Party demands adequate data protection for the European Health Data Space. We understand that health data is useful for science, but it can be misused by e.g. insurance companies and employers.
Health data must be anonymized and encrypted. To this end, it must be clearly defined where it is stored and when and by whom it may be used.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
Right to physical autonomy
CEEP PPEU
The European Pirate Party considers bodily autonomy to be an essential human right. Therefore, all medical interventions must be based on informed consent obtained without coercion.
Bodily autonomy requires that safe and legal abortions are available to all, regardless of the reason for their decision. We also demand free access to contraception, including male and female sterilization.
The fact that all medical interventions must be based on informed consent obtained without coercion applies in particular to interventions that affect sexual and reproductive health and rights. We therefore call for the criminalization of gender reassignment surgery on intersex children, unless it is absolutely medically necessary.
Furthermore, we call for a model of informed consent for gender reassignment treatments that are affordable and accessible. Neither legal gender recognition nor access to medical or surgical gender reassignment should be made dependent on abusive preconditions such as a psychiatric diagnosis, normative gender expression or medical procedures.
We will work to create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone can express their gender identity and sexual orientation freely and without fear of discrimination or violence.
Free movement of workers
EU citizens working in another EU country have to overcome dozens of administrative obstacles in order to work and fully integrate in another EU country - in particular different social security systems, different ways of paying into these systems, registration in healthcare systems and much more. Therefore, the EU should encourage its member states to further remove the administrative barriers to the free movement of workers by harmonizing social security and public health systems, especially the harmonization of payments into these systems and the exchange of information between member states.
Fight against discrimination
We propose a policy that promotes equal rights and opportunities for all people, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. We prioritize gender equality and LGBT+ rights. This includes ending discrimination and violence against women and LGBT+ people, promoting reproductive health and rights, and ensuring equal pay and equal employment opportunities. We believe that the recognition of same-sex marriage and parenthood should be enshrined.
CEEP	Common European

CEEP PPEU
Simple transition
As advocates of the digital and green transitions, we recognize that social, digital and environmental issues are interlinked, especially in certain regions. Therefore, we advocate for adequate EU funding for the most affected regions and for the development of new skills needed. We are pushing for lifelong learning, for example through upskilling and retraining. Ensuring adequate staffing in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics with a view to integrating underrepresented categories is a priority.
As part of the policy of leaving no one behind, we consider it necessary to provide vulnerable people/households with means of transition in terms of transportation, heating, insulation, etc.
Social standards
The Pirates defend the idea of universal access to education, knowledge, healthcare and adequate social protection. With regard to the latter, we must protect vulnerable groups from poverty and exclusion, including through measures that guarantee a minimum income and satisfactory social benefits.
Employees must be granted appropriate and good working conditions. Teleworking and platform work are becoming increasingly important, but there are still gaps in the regulations. We must ensure that the new forms of work do not increase the monitoring of employees and do not worsen their working conditions and rights.
European countries should ensure fair wages for employees working in the European Economic Area. While we recognize that a uniform definition of a fair wage is impossible in the current Europe, we believe that workers must be given transparent access to information and adequate legal protection to negotiate fair wages. There must be no double standards towards refugees and other non-citizens working in Europe. Further research and pilot projects for a universal basic income are welcomed.
European Pension Fund
Our goal is a truly social Europe with comparable social regulations and comparable pension conditions for all Europeans. Pension regulation must not lead to an even fiercer race of the poor against the very poor.
Several countries are facing a crisis in their national pension systems due to demographic change and migration between European countries. The Pirates therefore propose setting up a common European pension fund. The fund should not be seen as a replacement for national pension systems.
CEEP	Common European

but rather as an additional supplement to these in order to secure the necessary minimum
income if required. No one in Europe should be threatened by poverty in old age. Pensions should be fairly accessible to everyone, without unnecessary restrictions based on age or other criteria.
Mental health care: Strengthening prevention, improving care and promoting education
Introduction:
Effective mental health care requires a comprehensive approach that includes prevention, care and education. By taking these aspects into account, we can strive for a society that supports people with mental health problems and promotes their well-being. This text examines the key issues in mental health care and highlights the need for better accessibility, destigmatization, inclusion and education.
Prevention:
Prevention is the be-all and end-all in the field of mental health. To achieve this, we need to focus on improving access to mental health services in communities. This requires the development of a well-developed network of services that are available to all people, regardless of their geographical location. By ensuring that mental health services are accessible, we can effectively support those in need and reduce the risk of mental health problems escalating.
In addition to accessible services, community-based care should be recognized as a valuable resource for promoting mental health. By fostering a supportive community environment, we can create networks that help people overcome challenges and maintain their mental wellbeing. At the same time, it is important to destigmatize the field of psychiatry to make it more attractive and encourage people to pursue careers in this important area of healthcare.
Care:
When it comes to mental health care, it is crucial that street work and outpatient care take priority over inpatient services. Inpatient mental health services tend to be costly, so it is important to get local teams and prevention teams more involved. This approach allows for earlier intervention, reducing the need for more intensive and expensive inpatient care. In addition, emphasizing the rights of mental health patients is essential to ensure their dignity, autonomy and appropriate treatment within the healthcare system.
In order to promote better integration into society, it is important to create an environment that supports people with mental health problems. This includes
CEEP	Common European

CEEP PPEU
Providing appropriate support throughout life, with a particular focus on young people and
older people. Early intervention and prevention measures can make a significant contribution to improving mental health and reducing the long-term impact of mental health problems.
Education:
It is essential to improve the affordability and availability of mental health care for children and young people. Immediate action should be taken to ensure that these services are accessible to all who need them. In addition, efforts should be made to facilitate the training of mental health professionals, including supporting the initiatives of organizations such as the European Association for Psychotherapy. This will increase the range of psychotherapy available and facilitate access to it.
As schools have recognized the importance of mental health, they should make it a high priority in education. Including mental health as a priority in the curriculum can promote students' awareness, understanding and emotional well-being. In addition, strengthening the skills of nurses through increased specialization in psychiatry can improve the overall quality of mental health care.
Conclusion:
A comprehensive approach to mental health care includes prevention, care and education. By facilitating access to services, destigmatizing the field, prioritizing community-based care, and promoting inclusion and early intervention, we can improve the mental health of individuals throughout their lives. In addition, making mental health care affordable and available, simplifying the education and credentialing process, and incorporating mental health into school curricula are important steps in building a society that prioritizes the mental well-being of all people.

Space program
Space as a decisive factor
Satellite-based communication and navigation, earth observation for weather forecasting, disaster relief, pollution tracking and orbital research are now normal parts of our lives.
Space has become an economic factor.
The EU plays an important but relatively minor role in space technology. We want to stimulate and open up this sector. This will give a significant boost to technology and cooperation between EU Member States and other partner countries.
The commercialization of space opens up new opportunities such as space mining and space colonization. This will lead to significant economic progress. The EU must ensure that it gets its share of this development.
EU space vision for the future
Due to technological advancement and commercialization, activities in space are no longer a topic for the distant future. Interplanetary travel, planetary defense, space mining, manufacturing in space, colonization of other planets and even early concepts for interstellar space probes are issues that need to be addressed today.
The EU must define a clear vision, strategy and objectives to ensure international cooperation, multilateral global governance and the fundamental principles of the rule of law, justice and democracy in the space sector. We must ensure the continued development of the EU Space Program Agency, which is politically and financially accountable to the EU public through the EU institutions and is given an appropriate EU-wide mandate for space development.
Industrial space policy
Worldwide, space activities are shifting from government agencies to private and commercial companies.
In the current decade, the EU space program should focus on supporting development in the private sector. Publicly funded research should primarily use commercial launch services and focus on high-risk aspects where it can produce breakthrough technologies, such as light sails for long-range missions and resource extraction in space.
Independent EU launch capabilities with full reusability need to be developed to ensure that the EU has sufficient access to space.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
and can assume a leading position in technological and economic terms.
CEEP PPEU
A legal framework is needed to prevent the misuse and weaponization of space assets.
Law in space
The Outer Space Treaty (OST) does not cover many critical legal issues related to the use and commercialization of outer space. The EU, as a prime example of several nations working together for the common good, should take a leading role in extending the OST to cover important issues such as space mining, space debris and environmental aspects.
The space must be accessible and used for the benefit of all humanity.
Environmental laws in space should address issues such as pollution that can affect large areas or reach inhabited or potentially habitable space objects, areas that may harbor extraterrestrial life, and also the protection of places of great importance for research, such as the far side of the Moon, which has exceptionally low radio frequency interference, making it an important site for radio astronomy.
Space debris
Disused satellites, rocket stages and debris in orbit are a threat to space travel. The EU must push for international treaties that require the removal of space debris and prevent new space debris through controlled deorbiting of spent rocket stages and retired satellites.
Activities that generate space debris, such as testing of anti-satellite systems, must be outlawed.
Research programs for technologies to eliminate space debris must be provided with additional funding.
Planetary defense
The impact of a large object can cause immense damage to the Earth. Protecting the planet from such events is of great importance. We want to increase funding for projects to detect potentially dangerous near-Earth objects and for technologies to deflect dangerous objects.
Planetary defense activities must be internationally coordinated and integrated.
CEEP	Common European

CEEP PPEU
Short-term goals
Consumable launcher systems quickly become obsolete and the economic benefits of reusable systems are significant. The EU needs its own reusable launcher capability to remain competitive and enable larger projects.
In addition, an independent means of transportation for the crew, initially into Earth orbit, is required.
The development of these systems at national level will be necessary in order to keep pace with international developments, which are currently dominated by the USA and China.
Long-term goals
The EU space program should also fund goals that are or seem unattainable today. Working on distant goals, such as building an interstellar probe, a space elevator or a space hook, will stimulate the development of radically new technologies and materials. To ensure civilian use for the benefit of humanity and effective scientific and economic cooperation, such large and powerful space technologies should be developed with international partners.
Reaping the benefits of the space program
Investing in space technologies pays off tenfold. Pirates believe that investment in a large- scale space program will produce research results that have the potential to improve the lives of all. We want research results to be made available to the general public through open access principles. The application of space technology should benefit the daily lives of all people, such as the already increasing internet coverage in remote areas and satellite- based navigation.
Tell the story
Space exploration is underrepresented in the media. An essential part of the EU space program must be the communication of projects to the general public in order to raise awareness of the importance of space for the future of humanity.

Transportation
0. Transportation for all
Transport plays a crucial role in the European economy as it ensures the free movement of people and goods. However, it is also responsible for a large proportion of our emissions and is a major source of air pollution in our cities.
The decarbonization of the transport sector and the implementation of environmentally friendly, sustainable mobility are necessary to tackle the climate and energy crisis, improve the quality of life of citizens and make our cities more liveable. The foundations of our mobility concept are based on the principles of sustainability, intermodality and interconnectivity. We believe that all Europeans must have easy access to fast, reliable and environmentally friendly means of transportation.
We are committed to promoting public transport and rail networks. By investing in these modes of transport, we want to provide people across Europe with convenient, efficient and sustainable mobility options. Expanding public transport systems such as buses, streetcars and metros will encourage more people to choose these alternatives over private transport, reducing congestion and emissions.
In addition, by expanding and improving rail networks, we can offer faster and more reliable intercity and regional connections, making rail travel an attractive option for commuters and long-distance travelers. Our aim is to create a robust, multimodal and interconnected transport network that meets the needs of all people and contributes to a greener and more accessible Europe.
1. Green cities
Shared mobility and energy laziness Alternative fuels cannot save our planet as long as we continue to waste energy. We support the Shared Mobility Principles for Livable Cities initiative: If you can walk to something, you shouldn't drive, and if you can ride together, you shouldn't ride alone.
These principles aim to increase the use of public transportation, reduce the number of cars on the road, prioritize pedestrians and bicycles in environmentally friendly cities, and even save us billions of euros in productive time every day when commuters are stuck in traffic jams.
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
Accessible and efficient public transportation
CEEP PPEU
Public transportation must be affordable and accessible. Efficient public transport systems, bicycle highways and priority bus lanes reduce pollution and noise levels in cities.
In the long term, we want to reach transportation hubs by bike and public transport, trains for travel within the EU and planes, especially for overseas destinations. Sharing is important! Our priority here is appropriateness: the total cost of any solution (including long-term maintenance) must be proportionate to the overall public benefit. We support innovative solutions such as autonomous road trains, smart roads and parking lots, freight streetcars or modular buses where appropriate.
Open data for greener cities
To encourage cities to achieve European Green City status, we will measure pollution and noise levels in cities and use this information to reward cities that are committed to environmental sustainability. We believe in an open data system for transport that is accessible to all, with open data tools being developed for businesses and regional governments to easily connect them. We will ensure the security and privacy of personal data while making transportation data accessible to all. We will use open standards to ensure the interoperability of transport systems in all EU countries. As a result, transport in Europe will function similarly within the individual Member States. We want to promote the development of an efficient, accessible and environmentally friendly transport system.
Supporting the infrastructure for alternative fuels
While the car remains the main source of air pollution in cities and should not be the preferred mode of transportation, we respect everyone's freedom of choice. The automotive industry has the opportunity to play a leading role in the transition to clean mobility. Embedding the principles of the right to park, the right to charge and fair access to the installation of charging infrastructure at existing fossil fuel filling stations along the TEN- T network in European legislation will ensure a smoother deployment of clean technologies and accelerate the decarbonization of the European transport sector.
2. Local cross-border traffic
We believe that efficient and accessible transport can connect the different regions of Europe. We will develop and improve existing transnational connections that go beyond traditional national transport systems. The EU should support and ensure the development of fair transport solutions in border regions that enable efficient and organic transport across national borders. By using proven and sustainable
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
By using new modes of transport such as rail and new dynamic options (bicycle and car
sharing systems, on-demand public transport), we will strive to promote the peripheral regions of EU countries, which are often the most underdeveloped and poorly connected in their respective countries.
European high-speed rail network
We believe that the future of transport in Europe should prioritize modern, efficient and sustainable systems that can connect us all. Therefore, we propose to support measures that prioritize the development of a high-speed rail network that connects all EU capitals, uses new materials and technologies to make travel quieter and connects to existing rail networks.
A high-speed rail network would significantly improve travel efficiency in Europe, shorten travel times and increase productivity. This would have a positive impact on businesses by reducing costs and increasing productivity. It would also significantly improve accessibility to remote regions, as people would be able to travel more easily to areas that were previously difficult to reach. This would have a positive impact on the local economies of these areas as it would be easier for people to visit these regions as tourists or in their leisure time.
In addition to these benefits, a connected high-speed rail network will help reduce congestion on roads and highways, improving overall transportation efficiency and reducing travel times. By reducing the number of vehicles on the roads, a high-speed network will also have a positive impact on the environment by reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable travel.
3. Simple rules and intelligent technologies
European transport regulations are full of exceptions. To align these rules, competitive salaries and working conditions must be introduced for all professional drivers across the continent, including harmonization of the truck driving ban. We support progressive legislation for autonomous, driverless cars to address liability issues and keep the EU at the top of the automotive innovation ladder. The different modes of transport should be put on an equal legal footing, have a transparent subsidy system and their costs should reflect all relevant externalities.
Big Brother on the street
We strive for a unified, publicly controlled, easy-to-use toll satellite system for commercial traffic on highways that enables the use of open source apps, allows the processing of anonymized big data and thus improves municipal and interstate traffic management. We insist that eCall and other similar movement recording devices remain voluntary and that their data be strictly anonymized so that participation in such
CEEP	Common European
Election program for the 2024
European elections
CEEP PPEU
traffic monitoring measures remain a transparent means of choice with public benefit and do
not become an obligatory means of state surveillance through outsourced contractors and opaque control mechanisms.
Legislation on ride-hailing
Major EU metropolitan areas are currently in a legal limbo with regard to ride-hailing apps (e.g. Taxify, UBER), which is hindering further research and development of these projects. We believe that legislation needs to reflect current technological developments and that there needs to be a common framework for ride-hailing apps at EU level that allows precise satellite navigation and similar technologies to be recognized as a certified distance calculation system. The legalization of ride-hailing apps will particularly benefit rural areas and less affluent people and provide more security for gig workers.

Together for a strong Europe.
I. Introduction
We can look back on an impressive success story in a Europe once torn apart by war. Enemies became allies and partners. Today we live in a unique community of almost 450 million citizens, united in their diversity. The European Union i s the basis for security, peace and prosperity for the people on our continent.
In an unhinged world with a brutal Russian war of aggression on the European continent, this union is more important than ever. Anyone who puts Europe at risk, who attacks or questions Europe's unity and strength - whether from within or without - is attacking the foundations of our coexistence. A strong Europe that gives people security is therefore at the heart of our policies and actions.
It is in our deepest national interest to further develop the European Union and to help shape it according to our ideas. As the party with the chancellorship in Germany, the SPD has great power to shape the future of Europe and thus a special responsibility for its future. We accept this responsibility at all levels and handle it with care and determination.
What makes Europe strong
The European Union has proven itself in the crises of recent years. Social democratic crisis management has brought Europe together where conservatives had previously divided it. During the coronavirus pandemic, we proved how solidarity makes us strong through cross-border cooperation and the largest recovery fund in European history. Together with our European partners, we reacted decisively to the Russian war of aggression and supported Ukraine politically, economically and militarily. We want to build on this determined, joint European policy.
Europe is strong when there is peace and people can live together in security. We take responsibility for ensuring that no child born in the European Union today will ever experience war. To this end, we continue to focus on reconciliation and democracy using all diplomatic means. At the same time, we are strengthening our defense and military cooperation and are consistently working politically on the enlargement of Europe. Because cooperation and collaboration are the basis for peace within the European Union.
Europe is strong when its democracy is respected and protected. The European Union must be resilient and have effective instruments against its enemies from within and without. That is why we want to strengthen the rule of law and expand our democracy.
Europe is strong when climate protection succeeds and becomes a job engine. To achieve this, Europe must invest massively in future technologies and infrastructure and support industry on its path to climate neutrality. This will secure millions of jobs and create many new ones. A strong European single market is the backbone of our prosperity and will provide enormous benefits for employees, especially in Germany, if it is designed fairly.
Europe is strong when it contributes to people being able to lead a good, self-determined life. That is why we focus on social justice, especially in the transformation; on the fair distribution of costs and opportunities in the energy and mobility transition. Europe will only be successful if people on low incomes also live well and benefit from climate protection. We are also harnessing the potential of digitalization for progress and prosperity and ensuring that technologies and developments in Europe continue to be aligned with people's needs.
Europe is strong when good working conditions prevail and workers' rights are protected. No one in Europe should be exploited through their work. Wage and social dumping must be prevented more effectively.
Europe is strong when it speaks with one voice in the world. If we act together, we can help shape the world of tomorrow. Otherwise, others will determine the rules of global politics. The EU must act and be perceived as a sovereign geopolitical player.
Europe is strong when the brightest minds and most industrious hands see their home and future here. This requires an ambitious innovation agenda and modern immigration law. We need joint solutions for order and humanity at the external borders.
We are working for this strong Europe. Which principles guide us
Successful politics needs a compass to organize progress. We are therefore basing our program for a strong Europe on three principles that guide the SPD's actions:
We are creating a Europe of the future. If we make the best possible use of our resources, the largest single market in the world and the potential of the diversity of people in Europe, we can turn the necessary change into social progress and ensure that everyone benefits. We are committed to creating good work for all. We want to combat climate change and at the same time strengthen Germany and Europe as a business location. Together in Europe, we can ensure that we are leaders in global competition and that no one needs to be afraid of the future.
A strong Europe in the world is our response to global challenges, security changes and the pressure that the world's democracies are facing from populists and autocrats. When we speak with one voice, we are strong enough to make our values and interests heard in the world. Together, we want to make Europe the partner of choice, strengthen the rules-based order and work internationally for peace and against inequality.
We want a Europe of respect. We are proud that Europe offers us many opportunities to live our lives the way we want to. This includes good working conditions, a fair distribution of wealth and a safe and good life, no matter where you come from, what job you do or who you love. We will defend this principle against those who want to restrict and abolish it. Respect also means that fair rules apply to everyone.
Europe must take effective action against restrictions on the rule of law and the separation of powers, because the program of the populists and Europhobes is ultimately a social and cultural impoverishment program for the citizens.
What matters in the 2024 European elections
The European Union is currently facing a number of challenges that will determine how we will live in Europe and Germany in the future. The 2024 European elections are therefore a directional election in which the people of Europe will determine the way forward. We want a strong Europe that can protect our peace, our freedom and our prosperity, even in an increasingly uncertain world. We firmly reject right-wing populism, which has re-established itself across Europe and propagates national egoisms that we thought had been overcome and which jeopardize all our achievements in Europe.
Germany needs a strong Europe and Europe needs a strong Germany. Together, we can provide answers to current and future crises and challenges that are in tune with the times.
and are based on the foundation of our common values. This is how we ensure that we as Europeans have a good future together. Together, we can prevent the dangerous path of right-wing populists and their misanthropic policies.
We Social Democrats need your vote for this.
II. A Europe of the future
Our Europe of the future is climate-neutral and economically strong. For us, the two are closely linked. Climate protection must succeed because it is the basis for ensuring that future generations have a good livelihood. Europe's future is inconceivable without climate protection.
Europe is best placed to create the prosperity of the future through effective climate protection. To achieve this, Europe must remain an industrial location. We want an active industrial policy that invests massively in climate-neutral technologies of the future, in a secure energy supply, infrastructure and innovation. The expansion of renewable energies has absolute priority. Climate protection can thus become a job engine and lay the foundations for the next decade of economic growth and prosperity. European programs and initiatives are of crucial importance for us in Germany, because national and European climate and economic policies must go hand in hand.
The European single market will continue to be the backbone of economic development in the future and must be further deepened, as millions of jobs in Germany are closely linked to a strong single market. It must be fair and investments must be directed towards sustainable production processes. We will prevent the abuse of power by large companies at the expense of consumers, employees and the self-employed. We support the economy but also hold economic players accountable for creating the sustainable and fair prosperity of tomorrow. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are of central importance in this regard. The Europe of the future is also a Europe of innovation and creativity in which new ideas can flourish. This requires clear rules that are respected and enforced, as well as an innovation landscape that makes it easier to try out new methods and products.
We are stepping up to the plate to formulate answers that will ensure a life in freedom, peace and a just society today and tomorrow.
1. The future of Europe as a business and industrial location
With its fundamental freedoms of movement of goods, persons, services and capital, the European Single Market is one of the largest economic areas in the world. This common market is at the heart of our European economic strength and the engine of prosperity in Europe. 30 years after the birth of the single market, we are experiencing a major transformation of our economy and the way we live and work. In the course of this change, there is a global race for resources, technologies and standards. We want Germany and Europe to remain an attractive economic and industrial location that secures jobs and the prosperity of tomorrow. And we want to show in Europe that industry, climate protection and social progress can be brought together. That is why we need a new departure in economic and industrial policy in Europe. We want future technologies "Made in Europe".
Further development of the European industrial strategy
We want to further develop the European industrial strategy (Green Deal Industrial Plan) as part of a comprehensive location and resilience strategy and strategically prepare it for the future and the new challenges.
framework conditions in global competition. We will ensure that the EU Commission and the member states involve large sections of the economy, civil society and trade unions in particular in the further development of European economic and industrial policy. We want to further strengthen strong social partnerships, fair working conditions and high social standards in a socially and ecologically sustainable Europe. Above all, companies that benefit from state subsidies and transformation programs have a duty to offer good jobs in Europe on the basis of collective agreements in the long term. We also want to structure state subsidies in key industries and future technologies in such a way that they support value creation in Europe and make us strategically more independent.
Investments in industries of the future
We want to support industry in making the transition to climate-neutral and circular processes. We are focusing on both the basic industries and manufacturing sectors such as the leading automotive industry. We want to support these industries in their innovation efforts, which can also have an innovative impact on the rest of the economy. In particular, we see great strategic potential for the European market in areas such as green hydrogen, battery technology, electromobility, wind and solar power technologies and biotechnology. We want to ensure that production capacities are expanded in such key areas of digital and ecological transformation.
Improve regulation and speed up planning processes
For a successful active economic and industrial policy, we must have the ability to make strategic decisions at European level and at the same time reduce bureaucracy where possible in order to speed up planning processes and create space for entrepreneurship and creativity. A responsible reduction of bureaucratic obstacles in the internal market is urgently needed for large companies as well as for SMEs, start-ups, the self-employed and freelancers. At present, European industrial policy is regulated primarily by the ad hoc control of national aid and via a large number of platforms and bodies for different European programs.
There is a lack of data, analytical resources and bundled competencies at EU level. We want to change this and improve the quality of EU regulations. We will continue to work towards simplifying obstacles to investment such as lengthy approval procedures and extensive state aid reviews. To do this, we need an update of various regulations. In some cases, various regulations block each other. Here, we want to air things out without lowering protection standards. In addition, we want to support regions that lead the way and designate areas in which networked, climate-neutral industrial locations with good jobs are created with shortened and streamlined planning and approval procedures. To this end, we want to extend the concepts of go-to-areas, which we have already successfully implemented for wind energy, to other projects. We want to create more coherence in product and raw materials legislation and prevent double regulation. Reducing bureaucracy must not lead to lower social, environmental or safety standards. We want a large proportion of products to come from Europe when public contracts are awarded, also in order to reduce the EU's carbon footprint.
Protecting the internal market from unfair competition
We need further development of European competition and antitrust law, which must not only focus on competition within Europe, but also increasingly on the global competitive position of European companies. At the same time, we are convinced that it is the accumulation of market power in the hands of one company that destroys functioning markets, and not only the abuse of this market power.
Competition policy must therefore limit market power with
the instruments of antitrust law and merger control. European competition policy also plays a decisive role in limiting inflation by pursuing price increases that do not result from the actual market conditions of supply and demand (greedflation). The corresponding reform of German competition law, which was initiated by the German government, is an important step in the right direction. The harmonization of insolvency law in the European Union must be advanced with caution and consideration for nationally functioning regulations.
Skilled workers for Europe
In order to make our economy fit for the future, we need a sufficient number of workers at all skill levels. This includes well-trained skilled workers in particular. Demographic change will further exacerbate the existing shortage of skilled workers in the coming years. We must therefore make better use of the potential of domestic skilled workers and invest in further training. At the same time, we are dependent on the immigration of non-European skilled workers. In Germany, the Federal Government has made a long overdue paradigm shift towards a modern immigration society with the Opportunities Residence Act, the Skilled Immigration Act and the reform of the citizenship law, among other things. We want and need to work together in Europe to recruit skilled workers in a targeted manner. This requires an improved EU immigration law for skilled workers. We must also consider the provision of housing and offer not only workers, but also their families, integration measures and good prospects. It must be ensured that immigrants are placed in good, skilled jobs and are not exploited.
Because everyone in Europe has the right to a good job. Promoting innovation more strongly
We want to make the best possible use of the innovation potential of our society and economy in order to actively shape change. Our goal is a unified European knowledge and research landscape with a dense network of collaborations, joint programs and specifically funded major future projects in areas such as clean tech, quantum computing and artificial intelligence. We are committed to expanding the EU's IPCEI initiative for the promotion and relocation of strategically important companies to more sectors, opening it up to SMEs and significantly accelerating the processing of applications. We want to promote open source and open science and thus support sustainable and fair usage agreements and ensure that publicly funded research is also freely available to the general public. All of this is a core component of scientific sovereignty in a Europe of research and innovation.
Conserving resources in a European circular economy
For a future-proof and sustainable economy, we need sufficient resources that are used longer and more efficiently. We therefore need a coordinated EU raw materials strategy that aims to diversify raw material sources, use materials more efficiently, improve recycling and increase intra-European procurement, as well as promote joint research into sustainable alternatives to scarce raw materials.
The primary goal of EU resource policy must be the implementation of the EU waste hierarchy, in which material consumption is first avoided and reduced. By establishing a European circular economy on an industrial scale, we can further optimize production efficiency, reduce our carbon footprint and become less dependent on imports. We want consumers to have the right to have their products repaired at low cost, even after the warranty period has expired and in the event of a defect arising after the purchase of goods. We will abolish unnecessary disposable packaging and make manufacturers responsible for reducing single-use packaging and increasing reuse. We want to
Reform the textile industry sustainably and put an end to fast fashion. Textiles should last longer, be repairable and recyclable and be produced under humane conditions. Manufacturers and retailers must no longer simply destroy unsold goods. We want to reduce scrap exports and at the same time promote circular economy businesses in countries of the Global South. Where emissions are very difficult to avoid - such as in waste incineration, cement or parts of the chemical industry - we want to capture, reuse or, if necessary, store carbon dioxide in the sense of the circular economy (carbon capture, use and storage). This requires uniform regulations and a common infrastructure across Europe.
Reliable framework conditions for a strong healthcare sector and pharmaceutical industry
In order to ensure the best possible care for patients in Europe, we need a patient-oriented healthcare industry, including a strong pharmaceutical industry. We want reliable framework conditions for Europe as a location for research, production and innovation and a greater focus on applications. Europe must become attractive for conducting medical studies. We want to work more closely together in the areas of research funding, approval procedures and data use, as well as find the best procedures in European comparisons and use them as a basis for harmonization. This will enable us to speed up study approval and implementation procedures and significantly reduce bureaucracy. Adequate patent protection is an essential basis for all innovation activities. We will therefore work to ensure that innovation and research in Germany and Europe continue to pay off. At the same time, we will ensure that patients have better access to life-saving medicines. We also support national and European investment subsidies for production facilities and ensuring security of supply.
2. Renewable, affordable and secure energy supply
Europe's energy supply of the future must be renewable, affordable and secure. We have all experienced what happens when our energy supply is largely dependent on rulers like Vladimir Putin. Energy prices have skyrocketed and we have become vulnerable to blackmail. The energy price crisis following the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine was a crisis of fossil fuels. Thanks to a joint effort, we managed to reduce our dependence on Russia in the short term. Something like that must not happen to us again. We need to take advantage of the diversity of the European continent and the different locational advantages in order to be able to use sustainable energy sources such as the sun or wind as efficiently as possible, and work together in a European energy union to secure our energy supply.
Completing the European Energy Union
Connected national energy grids must become a European grid. We must jointly invest more in the expansion of renewable energies, cross-border hydrogen pipelines and power lines as well as in electrolysers and port infrastructure. We need a uniform and coherent regulatory and funding framework. We are committed to making the planning and approval of plants and infrastructure for the climate- neutral age as simple and unbureaucratic as possible. We are also driving forward the development of a European market for green hydrogen. In the production of
Biofuels must not be allowed to compete with food production.
In power plants, we want to end the use of fuels that weaken the important and shrinking CO2 reservoir of forests. As part of the Green Deal, we were able to
enforce that the EU member states must increase the CO2 storage capacities of peatlands, forests and meadows. We will pay attention to this when evaluating the national energy and climate plans,
that the Member States' plans for the use of bioenergy do not run counter to this. At the same time, we want the utilization of municipal and agricultural waste for the production of biogases to remain possible. It is important to us that the European Energy Union not only focuses on the EU27, but is also open to members of the European Economic Area and the EU's candidate countries. This completion of the Energy Union is the basis for the modernization of our economy, industry and society.
Secure international energy relations
Europe will remain an importer of energy, especially clean energy, but there must be no more one-sided dependencies. We are therefore calling for a strategy to diversify the European Union's global energy relations. We want to support the expansion of renewable energies in partner countries and establish global trade in hydrogen.
Reliable and affordable prices for energy
The considerable fluctuations in energy prices have hit households and businesses in the EU hard. For this reason, we want a far-reaching, structural reform of the EU electricity market design to ensure better integration of renewable energies into the electricity market. The pricing mechanisms for electricity should be reviewed and geared towards renewable energies in order to limit price and feed-in fluctuations. Electricity must become permanently affordable. With a
reform of the electricity market design and a European framework for bridge electricity prices, we want to create the conditions for competitive electricity and energy prices throughout Europe. We also reiterate our call for a national bridge electricity price. At the same time, we are driving forward the expansion of renewable energies and the
In addition, unjustified profits must be effectively avoided and, in exceptional cases, siphoned off. The cost benefits of renewable energies should be passed on to all energy consumers.
be passed on to consumer groups. In addition, we are expanding the range of instruments that contribute to the renewal of production facilities, such as European climate protection agreements and carbon contracts for difference. We reject the promotion of nuclear energy through EU funds. No taxpayers' money should flow into the expensive and unreliable high-risk technology of nuclear energy. The future belongs to renewables, which are already our cheapest energy sources today.
Energy-efficient living
We expressly support the initiatives launched in the last European legislative period to make Europe's building stock fit for the 2030 and 2045 climate targets. Energy-efficient residential buildings are good for protecting the climate as well as for reducing housing and ancillary rental costs for all citizens in the medium and long term. However, the yardstick for assessing the climate balance should always be the entire neighborhood or community and not the individual building. At the same time, we reject any form of individual refurbishment obligations for citizens. The member states, municipalities and large real estate companies should move forward here. Owners and landlords of single-family homes or apartments must be supported in taking the path to 2050 in a self-determined and sovereign manner.
3. Social climate and environmental protection
Climate change threatens our human existence. Fast action is needed. The European Union must be climate- neutral by 2050. Germany is making an important contribution to this with its 2045 climate neutrality target. So that the EU becomes climate neutral by 2050 at the latest,
we support an ambitious science-based greenhouse gas reduction target for 2040. For the European Union as the world's second largest economy, this is a major challenge, but also an economic opportunity. We will ensure that everyone can afford and participate in the transition to climate neutrality. If jobs are secured and the state invests in climate-neutral infrastructure that benefits everyone, then climate policy will be widely accepted. Implementing the Green Deal will make energy cheaper and make us less dependent on fossil fuel and raw material imports. The energy transition is a joint European technical and social task. Together, we can show that a consistent policy for climate protection goes hand in hand with social security and fair opportunities.
Social Green Deal
We are the guarantors that the green transition in Europe is fair and socially responsible. A sustainable industrial and economic policy that focuses on the modernization of the entire value chain in Europe will secure jobs and create social prosperity. A strong welfare state and active social policy with strong national social security systems ensure that no one is left behind in the face of change and that everyone benefits from progress. This should be supported and flanked by European and national social dialogs involving the trade unions, among other things. In addition, the laws on health and safety at work must be further adapted to new climate risks and a right to retraining and further training must be established. We want to achieve the targets agreed in Porto at both European and national level and ensure that at least 60% of employees take part i n further training once a year by 2030. We also want a feminist Green Deal in which all projects to combat the climate, biodiversity and pollution crisis are reviewed for their gender-specific impact on women. With instruments such as the Just Transition Fund and the Social Climate Fund as well as the Renovation Wave and the good implementation of the European Structural and Investment Funds, we want to ensure that all citizens benefit from a green and sustainable future. We will use these funds, for example, for energy-efficient renovations, the expansion of charging infrastructure for electromobility and public transport in underserved areas.
Strengthening the European emissions trading system
We want the biggest polluters to pay for the consequential costs of climate change. That is why we will continue to strengthen the European Emissions Trading System as one of the biggest levers for reducing EU emissions. The European Emissions Trading Scheme II for buildings and transport from 2027 must be further developed so that CO2 prices are more predictable and the risks associated with investments in sustainable technologies are thus reduced.
Multilateral commitment to global climate neutrality
In order to prevent irreversible changes in the climate system, such as the Gulf Stream drying up, we must achieve a carbon-neutral economy and lifestyle worldwide by 2050 at the latest and stop generating energy from fossil fuels. This is why we are continuing to work with our European partners in multilateral forums such as the UNFCCC to achieve an ecological restructuring of the global economy. The recommendations of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are the central benchmark for this. New superpowers such as China, India and Brazil will have to assume greater responsibility in the global community to protect the climate. We would like to motivate more countries to join the Climate Club initiated by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which has now grown to 36 countries, so that an ambitious multilateral framework for the rapid decarbonization of the industrial sector can be created.
Increase international climate financing
The climate crisis is also a crisis of international justice. While it was caused by the rich countries in particular, it is being felt especially in the poorer countries. We will therefore increase international climate financing and advocate the creation of an international transformation bank. We support the provision of financial aid for climate-related damage and losses in the countries most affected by the climate crisis within the framework of the UN Climate Convention. We want to better coordinate bilateral climate partnerships at European level and initiate and implement new climate partnerships. The EU must continue to act as a climate pioneer and bridge-builder at international climate conferences. To this end, it is also necessary to upgrade and strengthen climate foreign policy in the European External Action Service and in the EU's representations worldwide, both in terms of personnel and funding.
Consistently protecting nature
The climate crisis is closely linked to the biodiversity crisis, which also poses existential threats. Overexploitation and pollution of land and sea as well as invasive alien animal and plant species have contributed to a severe deterioration of biodiversity and ecosystems. We will therefore take the necessary measures to implement the Montreal Biodiversity Convention and the EU Biodiversity Strategy. We are striving for sustainable agriculture and forestry and want to place 30 percent of the EU's land and sea area under protection. In doing so, we will maintain and secure the flexibility required for the expansion of renewable energies and the production of the necessary plants and grid infrastructure. We want a responsible
We want to protect our natural resources and health. We will therefore revise EU chemicals policy so that potentially harmful substances are also restricted or banned more quickly and may not be exported to other parts of the world. Especially where these substances are more likely to be
convenience substances are used, we must quickly restrict their use. In other areas, we need to develop substances with similar properties to replace harmful substances.
As a result, their use should also be restricted or banned in these areas
can. We will continue to consistently drive forward measures to protect nature and call for a zero- tolerance policy by the Commission when EU directives and regulations are violated.
regulations are not complied with. Infringement proceedings for failure to implement EU nature conservation legislation must be initiated consistently.
Investing in the restoration of nature
Just protecting what is still healthy is no longer enough. The state of our natural basis of life has been deteriorating for years. We need to restore nature and improve the disturbed balance of our ecosystems. We therefore want to adopt an ambitious law on soil health and provide sufficient funding for the restoration of nature, including within the framework of European agricultural funding, in order to counteract the rampant sealing of land and the loss of natural habitats in the EU.
Sustainable agriculture
The Common European Agricultural Policy must do more to achieve the environmental and climate goals it has set itself. At the same time, its contribution to securing farmers' incomes is not sufficient. European agriculture must therefore be better positioned for the future. So that Germany retains a strong agricultural base of its own in Europe,
farmers need good and reliable framework conditions. Fair conditions must apply in competition and necessary changes must be made fairly. In future, the remuneration of public services, such as sustainable management, the preservation of diverse cultural landscapes, environmental, pollinator, water and soil protection and the expansion of natural CO2 reservoirs, will be central to this. In future, this should offer fair prices for the food produced as well as an income for the provision of public services. We are striving to further develop agricultural funding that focuses even more strongly on aspects of climate protection, climate adaptation and biodiversity. The framework conditions for adequate agriculture must be created in such a way that comprehensive food security within Europe is even better secured while at the same time preserving natural resources and complying with sustainability criteria (ecological, economic and social).
Urgently needed reforms to adapt agricultural policy to the objectives of the Green Deal must be implemented. We want to continue to significantly reduce the use of pesticides. We want to support organic farming in achieving the target of a 25 percent share of land in Europe. The increased use of digital technology, AI and drones will play a key role in this. We reject genetic engineering in the conventional sense. We will examine the use of new genomic techniques (CRISPR/Cas, gene scissors) with an open mind. The precautionary principle and the associated comprehensive risk assessment in individual cases prior to any potential approval are our top priority. After all, new genetic engineering techniques can also have undesirable effects. Consumers who do not want genetically modified plants on their plates need freedom of choice. If new genetic engineering is approved, the traceability and labeling of products made with genetically modified plants is therefore essential.
At the initiative of the Social Democrats, for the first time in the history of European agricultural policy, compliance with minimum social standards will be a condition for receiving European funding in addition to climate and environmental protection.
This newly introduced social component in the CAP must be expanded. Contract workers and seasonal workers deserve to be treated fairly, and good employers and fair farm managers must be favored.
Protecting water as a public good
Large parts of Europe are suffering from extreme drought and heavy rainfall events. This not only prevents high-yield farming, but also increases the risk of flooding disasters. We are therefore calling for a European water
Strategy that looks at water problems across all sectors and includes all economic sectors and consumers. We want,
that water retention in the landscape is improved. European marine protection and fisheries policy
Many fish populations in the EU are suffering from overfishing. We want a European fisheries policy with science-based catch quotas that enables the recovery of overfished fish stocks and puts an end to harmful fisheries subsidies. We want to prevent overfishing through stricter controls on illegal, undocumented and unregulated fishing. We will place at least 30 percent of Europe's marine areas under protection and restore at least 20 percent of degraded marine ecosystems to a good state by 2030. An open dialog with the fishing industry is important to us so that investments, new business models and practices can be effectively supported and implemented.
Improve animal welfare
Animal suffering cannot be justified, especially not for economic reasons. We must therefore consistently focus on improving animal welfare in agricultural animal husbandry. We are calling for a Europe-wide standardized labelling requirement for farming methods and an animal welfare label for all unprocessed and processed animal products to enable consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. Eight hours of transportation of live animals must be the maximum allowed in the EU. We also need a ban on the transportation of live animals to third countries where compliance with animal welfare legislation cannot be guaranteed. We are also continuing to
to safeguard the welfare of wild and domestic animals.
4. Digitization for the people
Digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) are changing all areas of our lives and economies. We therefore need a coherent and harmonized digital policy that covers all areas of life and involves all Europeans - a true realization of the Digital Union. Europe has achieved many milestones in recent years, such as the Digital Service Act, and has proven that a united Europe with its values can play a pioneering role in the digital world when it comes to shaping digitalization in a democratic, sovereign and fair manner. We want to continue on this path. We want to harness the potential of digital technologies for progress and prosperity in Europe. The latest technological developments have also made it clear that we need to position ourselves more independently and more crisis-proof. That is why we want to ensure the development and production capacities for the manufacture of key digital technologies and network technologies as well as the establishment of computing capacities, for example for the development of European AI models in Europe, and promote them even more than before.
With everything that is technically possible, we focus on the opportunities without losing sight of the risks and challenges. The essential pillars of our actions are our shared European values and a people-centered approach to digital transformation.
Protection, confidentiality and sovereignty in the digital space
In both the analog and digital world, we are committed to protection against discrimination and want fundamental rights such as data protection, privacy and freedom of expression and assembly to be guaranteed. To achieve this, citizens must be better informed about their rights. In the event of significant impacts on people's lives, we must ensure that it is people who make the final decisions and have the authority to act accordingly. Legal recourse against the decision must be open.
The protection of privacy and the confidentiality of communication are key prerequisites for citizens' trust in digitalization. The confidentiality of digital communication is a prerequisite for safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms and our democracy. We therefore reject any form of mass surveillance. We reject the circumvention or breaking of encryption, the retention of vulnerabilities and the use of spying software by private or state agencies. We also firmly oppose the storage of data without cause and the monitoring of digital communication without cause.
We want citizens to have control over their data in a digital union. Digital profiling jeopardizes privacy and democracy and can lead to discrimination, misleading and manipulation for advertising purposes and political influence. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was a quantum leap in data protection policy and demonstrates the outstanding performance of European solutions. It has become a global model that many countries are following. At the same time, however, the implementation of the GDPR has also shown that
some rules overshoot the mark and burden citizens, small associations with voluntary structures and small and medium-sized enterprises with more bureaucracy than necessary. We are therefore committed to the consistent implementation and further development of the GDPR. In addition to a high level of privacy protection and consumer protection, we also want to focus on reducing bureaucracy and digital progress. To this end, we will evaluate the regulation of digital platforms and make further improvements where necessary.
Effective and coherent governance
In recent years, the EU has introduced many pieces of legislation such as the Digital Services Act (DSA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and, most recently, the AI Act. In the next step, we want to ensure that sufficient resources are available for the effective implementation of the legal acts so that the requirements can be implemented in the member states in a transparent, solution-oriented and uniform manner.
Promoting democracy and combating disinformation
People are increasingly confronted with disinformation, deepfakes and other forms of manipulation. The deliberate or negligent manipulative effect of fake news undermines solidarity in our society and the resilience of our democracy. We want to protect the European public and our democratic institutions from these influences. We must not only focus on disinformation from outside, but also fight disinformation that originates within the EU.
This includes clear rules for digital platforms, such as those developed in Europe in recent years. We are committed to the effective enforcement of these rules through strong governance in order to counter fake news and hate speech online. We also want to support the establishment and support of Europe- wide non
commercially and decentrally organized digital communication and trading platforms. They should form a genuine alternative to commercial platforms. Effective rules and sanctions against so-called deepfakes are also needed.
The right of access to knowledge is one of the great achievements of the Enlightenment. In the analog age, this access was guaranteed and promoted by public libraries and universities. In the digital space, access to reliable information is much more difficult; for example, different license conditions often apply to physical books and eBooks, and the results of publicly funded research are often not freely available. We will therefore campaign for an Open Knowledge Act that breaks down barriers and gives researchers and citizens easier access to knowledge of all kinds.
Ensuring digital sovereignty
In addition to clear rules for digital markets and services and the use of data in accordance with fundamental rights, strengthening our digital sovereignty also requires greater technological and economic independence. We need to become more independent in the development, production and use of digital technologies and position ourselves better in a crisis-proof manner against influences such as cyberattacks from abroad, especially to protect critical infrastructures. Digital platforms and, in future, artificial intelligence will become an essential part of our infrastructure and services of general interest. In these areas, we want to minimize our dependence on manufacturers outside Europe. We also need to protect our democratic processes, including our elections, not only from disinformation, but also from cyberattacks. We also want companies that respect our fundamental rights and do not exploit them to be given preferential consideration in the awarding of public contracts. Finally, the use of open source should be promoted.
AI models with European values
Algorithmic decision-making systems can relieve administrative burdens, create new jobs or improve healthcare. However, they can also violate consumer and human rights, and this also applies to other methods of artificial intelligence. The development and use of artificial intelligence methods must follow European values. That is why we want to prevent the renewed dominance of large tech monopolies in the development and dissemination of AI models. We want to develop generally accessible AI models on a European scale and in accordance with European values, particularly for use in public administration procedures or where there is a high level of public interest, such as in the area of health, in order to avoid dependencies and set global standards "Made in Europe". We want to make the member states the drivers of these developments by demanding innovations "Made in Europe", e.g. in the field of AI or, in future, in the field of quantum computing, and thus ensure their scaling. We want to simplify and accelerate access to funding. In addition, we want to enable bundled European cutting-edge research in the field of AI in order to train and retain specialists in Europe. We are committed to independent data protection authorities, impact assessments and transparency and labeling obligations within the EU. This applies in particular to AI
basic models. It is also important to support small and medium-sized companies in the use of AI and to promote open source approaches in the field of AI.
An open and free Internet
The principle of net neutrality is a cornerstone of the open and free Internet and is not up for debate when it comes to expanding network infrastructures. Fair, equal access to the Internet for all users and services without restrictions must be guaranteed; we reject any unequal treatment of certain content by network providers. This also means that fast Internet must be affordable for everyone.
5. Turning Europe into a mobility union
The free movement of goods, services and people is a major achievement of the European Union. People use it for private and business purposes. The challenge is to make mobility climate-neutral, reliable and affordable as quickly as possible. Together with our European partners, we are facing up to this challenge and initiating a genuine European mobility transition. This requires a transformation in all areas of transport, including private transport, public transport and freight transport. Transport planning from a European perspective is also necessary to better connect border regions. This will promote economic development throughout Europe and open up the possibility of switching to more climate-neutral means of transportation. At the same time, European solutions simplify everyday life for mobile Europeans.
Advancing common European rail routes
Germany has the largest rail network in Europe. We are ensuring that a general overhaul worth up to 45 billion euros is carried out. We also want to use this joint national effort to invest in the construction and expansion of European railroad lines.
Building on the goal of a German cycle, we want to create the conditions for a European cycle which, in addition to increasing punctuality, also focuses on connections to European networks. We will increase the capacity, reliability, accessibility, availability and seamless cross-border operation of rail freight transport in the Union.
European trains as an alternative to airplanes
We want to actively promote the trend towards climate-friendly night trains and establish a European night train network. In the short term, we want to establish more ICE Sprinters, especially in competition with
Short-haul flights. Rail travel within Europe should be cheaper and more attractive than flying. The establishment of competitive and innovative high-speed train connections and night trains should be supported by all member states, as they represent an environmentally friendly and competitive alternative in international transport.
Clean mobility for all
As social democrats, we are committed to ensuring that all population groups have access to climate- friendly transport solutions and that no one is disadvantaged on the basis of social status or income. This also includes the promotion of public transport in rural areas and the preservation of good jobs in the transport sector. The conversion to climate-friendly means of transport in local public transport should also be significantly accelerated across Europe.
Europe ticket for public transport and Europe-wide ticket app
The Deutschlandticket is a great success. We want to work together to ensure that it is also recognized in our neighbouring countries, such as France. This should ease the burden on commuters in border regions and make local vacations easier and cheaper. Our vision is a European ticket for the entire EU. We also want to establish a cross-transport, Europe-wide booking option for international trains, buses and other mobility services on behalf of the public sector - with a mobile app throughout the EU. Together with our neighbors, we want to introduce an EU-wide ticketing system. Railcard discounts should be fully valid for cross-border connections.
Free Interrail ticket for all 18-year-olds
DiscoverEU is a successful project of the European Union. Every year, thousands of young people get to know Europe by train with a free Interrail ticket. In future, all 18-year-olds in the EU should have this opportunity. To ensure that young people with little money can also afford the travel costs, we want to gradually make uncomplicated funding possible via Erasmus+. We want to expand the DiscoverEU youth card with discounts on accommodation, food, sport, culture, learning activities and public transport.
More freight transport by rail
We are aiming for a much greater shift of freight transport from road to rail. This is an important key to achieving the Union's energy efficiency and climate targets. We need to give more support to the rail sector and promote the most efficient use of the network. Around three quarters of freight traffic is currently carried by road, which is around 1.3 million trucks a day. One freight train alone could replace up to 62 trucks! By 2030, we want to increase the share of rail freight transport to 30 percent of all freight transport for routes over 300 kilometers and to more than 50 percent by 2050. Rail freight transport in the EU needs higher capacity, reliability, availability and seamless cross-border operations. To achieve this, we are focusing on efficient European freight corridors and the digitalization of the railways. In particular, we will drive forward EU-wide funding for the nationwide introduction of digital automatic coupling (DAC).
Expand infrastructure for electric and hydrogen-powered mobility
We want to pave the way for electric and hydrogen-powered mobility. To this end, electric fast-charging stations are to be installed at least every 60 kilometers and hydrogen filling stations every 200 kilometers. We also want European support through targeted EU funding, start-up financing and pilot projects for shared mobility services, micro-mobility and autonomous driving. We need reliability through clear European regulations and funding.
These will also be available for research and development and for the establishment of key technologies, such as battery cell technology.
industry or autonomous driving.
Climate-neutral aviation and shipping, European ports and airports
Sustainable aviation fuels, such as e-kerosene, are a decisive step towards drastically reducing the aviation industry's CO2 emissions. More than 200,000 additional jobs could be created in Europe. This offers the opportunity for new training and education opportunities in the production of sustainable aviation fuels. It is important to us that fuel production does not compete with food production. We want to introduce an EU label for the environmental compatibility of flights. This will enable passengers to compare the environmental impact of flights and make informed decisions. We also want to increase the requirements for the use of sustainable fuels for cargo ships and support port cities in the rapid installation of shore-side power systems.
6. Financing the future
The ecological and digital transformation of the European economy and our society requires a high level of investment. This includes both public and private investment. There is no doubt that this is an enormous effort, but one thing is clear: we are investing in our future prosperity and a future worth living. In times of ongoing economic uncertainty, we continue to rely on fiscal leeway within the EU. In dealing with the pandemic, we have seen the role that far-sighted fiscal policy can play in stabilizing the economy. This state capacity to act in times of crisis remains important. The decisive factors here should be the innovative strength, adaptability and performance of companies and not the fiscal capacity of individual member states.
Investing in the future together
With the historic decisions on the European Recovery Fund, we boldly broke new ground under the leadership of the then Federal Minister of Finance, Olaf Scholz. Next Generation EU has provided a decisive impetus for sustainable investment in the future. Together with the SURE crisis instrument for short-time work, we were able to provide a powerful response to the crisis during the pandemic. We want to turn this strong sign of European solidarity into lasting progress towards integration. We are committed to permanently suitable instruments to support the European economy and its workers in the transformation and to respond to acute crisis situations in a spirit of solidarity, including through joint borrowing. After all, more public funds are needed to master the challenges of the socio-ecological transformation. We want to further develop the SURE crisis instrument and ensure that all member states can maintain their important social security systems even in times of severe economic crises through permanent European unemployment reinsurance, without this leading to permanent financial transfers.
Creating scope for investment
We want to reform European state aid law to ensure that necessary investments can be made at the right time. To this end, we want to speed up approval procedures. The approval of aid should be consistently linked to compliance with social and environmental criteria. Even countries with a higher level of debt must be able to master the climate-neutral and digital transformation and make social investments. We therefore urgently need a determined, coordinated and solidarity-based European
Investment policy. The restructuring of the European economy can only succeed if companies in all member states benefit from public support measures. Otherwise, there is a risk that the competitiveness of the single market as a whole will be weakened, to the detriment of the German economy, which benefits most from an efficient single market. A flexibilization of EU state aid law therefore requires that fiscally weaker member states can use European funds in the sense of a common investment policy.
Reform of the Stability and Growth Pact
We will continue to develop the Stability and Growth Pact. The aim is to enable future investments for the climate-friendly restructuring of our economies and digitalization. It is about anchoring realistic and binding rules for debt reduction and at the same time improving the comprehensibility and transparency of the pact. We will ensure sustainable public finances in all European countries without rigid austerity policies returning to Europe. With this in mind, the Social Democrat-led German government has succeeded in reaching an agreement among the member states on a reform of the European fiscal rules. Unlike the conservatives during the financial crisis, it has brought Europe together on this sensitive issue instead of dividing it. In future, member states will be able to agree individual debt paths with the European Commission that are based on realistic common standards. We reject rigid borrowing requirements for the member states, as they prevent investment and impair the states' ability to act. We are committed to further democratization in the area of economic policy coordination and to strengthening the role of the European Parliament in the European Semester. The policy recommendations within the framework of the European Semester must be in line with the EU's fundamental policy objectives, such as the Green Deal or the European Pillar of Social Rights.
Competitive financing of European companies
In order to promote investment and ensure the competitive financing of European companies, a common, functioning European capital market should finally be created. To this end, we will increase the political pressure for the completion of the banking union and, above all, the capital markets union with appropriate supervision. In this way, private capital can be mobilized across borders and channeled into companies. These companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, can use the capital market as a financing channel more easily and to a greater extent than before. At the same time, savers will benefit from broader access to investment opportunities for asset accumulation and retirement provision. In addition, a completed Capital Markets Union can make an important contribution to strengthening financial stability through greater diversification in corporate financing and also improve international competitiveness. In this way, we will create an integrated and liquid European capital and banking market and break up financial fragmentation within Europe. In doing so, we will promote growth and jobs and improve investor protection. In particular, the opportunities for start-ups in Europe must be significantly strengthened.
Creating prospects for urban and rural areas
All people should have the same opportunities to realize their full potential - regardless of where they live. Rural areas and small and medium-sized towns account for over 80 percent of the EU's territory.
Around a third of the entire EU population lives in these regions. These regions provide diverse and centrally important functions for society as living, economic, recreational, cultural and environmental spaces. Our aim is to support cities, coastal regions and rural areas in the sustainable transformation of our societies and to prevent individual regions from being left behind in the transformation process. An investment policy that shows people what Europe actually means for
has proven its worth, particularly in eastern Germany, and has made the catch-up process in the new federal states a success. We will continue to rely on sustainable funding for European regional policy in the future. Together with the social partners and civil society, our cities and regions should continue to be able to decide as unbureaucratically as possible which local investments they want to co-finance with EU funds. From 2028, we want to expand the European Structural and Investment Funds into a genuine transformation instrument that ensures socially just change and at the same time promotes innovation.
We will protect the EU structural funds even better against misuse by authoritarian governments. A powerful EU budget
Anyone who wants to develop the European Union further must be prepared to provide its budget with
appropriate financial resources. We want a European budget that is up to the challenges of our time. We are calling for additional funds to be invested in the EU's key policy areas that deliver recognizable European added value for the next multiannual financial framework in 2027. We believe that if the EU takes on a wide range of new tasks, as it has done in recent years, it should also receive the necessary funding.
To this end, we want to make the EU more financially independent of national governments. We want to relieve the German budget of contributions to the European budget and replace them with genuine own resources for the EU. The principle must apply: Revenues generated by European policies belong in the EU budget.
In order to strengthen the revenue side, we need European coordination and regulations in corporate taxation that effectively prevent tax avoidance and evasion by internationally active companies. With the minimum taxation of 15 percent at OECD level, we have already reached an important milestone; now it is important to implement the agreements in all member states and use the funds to strengthen the EU budget. Our goal is a uniform basic
corporate income tax of 15 percent on a uniform assessment basis in
Europe. We also want to introduce a comprehensive financial transaction tax on all securities and foreign exchange transactions in the short term, as well as an EU own resource by taxing share buybacks by companies. We are also strengthening the EU
budget through revenues from the new CO2 border adjustment mechanism (CBAM.
Own resources should not only fulfill a revenue function, but also contribute to achieving our political goals. As a party of social justice, we want to combat social inequality in Europe. EU funds must therefore be linked to criteria such as good work and collective bargaining.
III. A strong Europe in the world
The increase in conflicts around the world is already causing people to seek protection or a better life here, leading to rising prices and supply bottlenecks. The rules and institutions of global cooperation are under increasing pressure, and the war in Ukraine has seriously shaken the European security architecture.
We therefore need a strong Europe that defends our common values of peace, freedom and democracy and is committed to being a force for peace in the world. A Europe that also stands up internationally against poverty and exclusion and for peace, development and human rights. The EU's enlargement policy is an instrument of enormous transformative power. A growing Europe must be a better Europe. The Europe of 35 and more states cannot be led in the way that
This is why we advocate internal reforms, reformed institutions and leaner decision-making processes. Enlargement and reform must go hand in hand.
The European Union is already showing that cooperation makes us stronger than confrontation. That is why we n e e d	t o	look even harder for common ground between the member states and speak with one voice in the world. We will realign European trade policy and invest more in strategic partnerships - to secure important resources, but also to engage in peaceful conflict resolution, sustainable development and renewed trust in international relations. In doing so, we will t r e a t the countries of the Global South as equal partners and work to ensure that the feminist perspective is always taken into account. We want a migration and refugee policy based on solidarity that combines humanity and order.
1. For a peaceful Europe
The Russian attack on Ukraine has brought war back to the European continent. We know from the policy of détente under Willy Brandt that military strength is important to protect the European peace project. That is why we want to strengthen the European pillar in NATO and take more responsibility for our own security. With the permanent stationing of a German brigade in Lithuania and the investment in joint air defense (European Sky Shield Initiative, ESSI) announced by Olaf Scholz, we are already increasing the quality and concept of our contribution to NATO - we want to expand this commitment further. At the same time, as the peace party in Germany, we will continue to focus on diplomacy and dialog, civil crisis prevention and peacebuilding as well as disarmament and arms control. Security and peace are inextricably linked, but peace is more than security. The triad of foreign, development and defense policy therefore remains the cornerstone of social democratic international policy.
Vision of a European army
We Social Democrats have long had the vision of a European army, because we know that important synergy effects can be achieved through joint investments and the organization of our armed forces. In line with the strategic compass of the European Union, we want it to become a more capable security actor. Even if NATO retains its central role in the defense of our alliance, we want to enable Europe to ensure security against external threats increasingly independently. We advocate greater harmonization in the training of soldiers in the EU and the strengthening of efficient and at the same time democratically legitimized decision-making structures in the Common Security and Defence Policy. For us, this includes in particular the involvement of the European Parliament, the strengthening of the office of the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the establishment of an independent Council of Defense Ministers.
-Minister.
More joint European procurement
With the special fund for the Bundeswehr, we have proven that we are prepared to provide the necessary financial resources to make Europe more capable of acting in the area of security and defense. We must ensure that the investments that have been initiated are continued and are therefore committed to sustainable defense funding of at least 2 percent of gross domestic product. We want to create more incentives for collaborative spending on defense at European level by substantially improving European funds (EDF, EDIP). We are committed to greater transparency in coordinated European defense planning in order to increase the pressure on member states to meet their commitments. We also want more
Create synergies between NATO and EU planning processes and better coordinate the various innovation initiatives.
A single European market for defense
We want to achieve greater standardization and interoperability in Europe through more joint development and procurement. We want to actively promote and financially support joint armaments projects. We are also focusing on more standardized certification procedures and procurement cycles. It is also about harmonizing regulations in Europe in order to facilitate the transport of reinforcements to NATO bases.
eastern flank. And it is about a gradual liberalization of the European defence market for products that are not considered key national technologies.
Actively pursuing disarmament and arms control
Especially in times of global rearmament, it is our duty as Europeans to actively promote disarmament and arms control initiatives, as they are part of a forward-looking security policy. We will therefore actively campaign for an international set of rules on armed drones and establish arms control and effective regulation in the areas of bioweapons, cyber and artificial intelligence. We remain committed to the long- term goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.
Common European arms export policy
The war in Ukraine has made it clear that we need a more strategic approach in our arms export policy. As Social Democrats, we have carefully weighed up every arms delivery to Ukraine. An agreement on arms exports at European level is necessary for a single market for defense - different rules stand in the way of joint development and production. We therefore advocate a common and coordinated European arms export policy based on shared values and strategic priorities. European military equipment must not fall into the wrong hands. At the same time, we must provide better and more reliable support to our strategic partners.
2. A European Union for all Europeans
The EU's enlargement policy was and is a driving force for peace, democracy, the rule of law and prosperity in Europe. We want to continue this success story. We want to seize the opportunity to accompany our European neighbors in a lasting democratic transformation, also so that other actors do not take the place of the EU. After all, the EU's enlargement policy is one of the most important instruments of EU foreign policy.
Accelerate accession of the Western Balkan states
Over 20 years ago, the EU gave the countries of the Western Balkans the prospect of accession. After years of delay, it is now high time that the countries of the Western Balkans were swiftly accepted into the heart of our community once the accession criteria have been met. We are generally committed to establishing recognizable intermediate steps in the enlargement process and want to examine the extent to which, for example, access to the common internal market can be granted before full EU membership.
Ukraine as part of the EU
We want Ukraine and Moldova to become part of the EU as soon as they meet the admission criteria. Citizens and governments in both countries leave no doubt that they are ready to live the European idea, are already guided by common values and long for the protection of the community to be able to live in peace and freedom. For a
With our successful Eastern Europe policy, we want to create the conditions for the admission of Ukraine, Moldova and, in the future, Georgia and politically secure the admission process to the EU. With enlargement, we are sending a clear signal against the unilateral shifting of borders by Putin's Russia, committing ourselves to the joint reconstruction of Ukraine and enabling people striving for peace, freedom, the rule of law and democracy to gain access to our community of values.
European values as a basic prerequisite
We will align the admission of new member states even more strongly than before with our fundamental European values and place democracy, human rights and the rule of law at the forefront of the process. The Copenhagen criteria must always be fulfilled as a basic requirement. If fundamental EU principles are disregarded, the EU must be consistent and also protect the EU's canon of values vis-à-vis member states.
Deepening our relationship with our neighbors
We want to become more flexible in our cooperation with our European neighbors, because we benefit from bringing them closer to us. To this end, we r e c o g n i z e the potential of the so-called European Political Community in addition to long-established forms of cooperation. Even independently of the EU enlargement process, it is crucial to build trust and actively identify common interests with our neighbors, for example in the areas of sustainable energy, infrastructure and security.
The democratic Baltic Sea region also has an important role to play. It is one of the most innovative and competitive regions in the world. In addition to the necessary transformation efforts, there are other challenges that affect all Baltic Sea states equally: protecting the Baltic Sea, achieving energy independence, realigning security policy, coping with the consequences of demographic change, securing services of general interest, especially in rural areas, the future-oriented development of digitalization and the safe use of artificial intelligence.
3. Strengthening the EU's ability to act
The enlargement of the European Union must go hand in hand with treaty reforms. Only a capable and sovereign European Union will be in a position to accept new members. Even today - with 27 member states - the decision-making processes are already hampering the Union's progress and its ability to react in times of crisis. In the face of global challenges, efficient democratic decision-making structures are needed that take account of increasing complexity. A basic prerequisite for the enlargement of the European Union is therefore the implementation of institutional reforms. This is also the conclusion of the Conference on the Future of Europe, in which thousands of European citizens took part. At the same time, we want to strengthen the foundations - the values and democracies - on which the European Union is built. The question of the rule of law is not an internal matter for each member state, but its violation is a threat to the entire Union. Only if the EU manages to defend itself against its internal enemies of democracy can it credibly stand up for its values in the world.
Reforming decision-making processes
Veto rights of individual member states in the European Council, which already hinder the progress of the Union and are used as a means of exerting pressure, must be a thing of the past. An essential component of institutional reforms is therefore to replace the unanimity principle in the Council, where it still applies today, with the introduction of majority decisions. This will make the EU more agile, quicker to act and more democratic. If a sovereign Europe is our aspiration, then
Majority decisions are a gain and not a loss of sovereignty. Enforcing common values
The common European values apply to all member states - without exception. We are strongly committed to protecting democracy, the rule of law and human rights in the EU. To this end, we are using existing protection instruments more rigorously and developing new instruments to protect our common values. For example, we want to apply infringement proceedings for violations of the rule of law much more consistently than before. In addition, the European Council must urgently apply the fundamental values procedure in Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union (EU Treaty) and withdraw the voting rights of member states that systematically violate fundamental values. This is the only way we can prevent increasingly undemocratic member states from abusing their veto rights and holding the Union hostage in the short term.
To this end, it is also necessary to adapt the fundamental values procedure in Article 7 of the EU Treaty. The European Parliament needs more say and it must no longer be possible for individual member states to block sanctions in the Council. We are also calling for the EU Commission to take member states that violate the values of Article 2 of the EU Treaty to the European Court of Justice. In the future, it should also no longer be possible for states that seriously violate the values set out in Article 2 to bring the EU Commission before the European Court of Justice.
take over the Council Presidency. Financially sanction violations
There is also a need for stricter financial sanctions for violations of the EU's common values. In recent years, we have achieved that EU funds can be withheld from rule-of-law offenders. We must extend this means to all violations of the values of Article 2
EU Treaty, especially when the Union's budget is not directly threatened. The European Commission must take more consistent action here in future. Finally, we are calling for an independent Copenhagen Commission to monitor whether the Commission and Council are applying the existing instruments.
Strengthening European democracy
A central element for strengthening European democracy is the expansion of the role of the European Parliament as a central place of representation for citizens. This includes a genuine right of initiative with which the directly elected representatives of the people can initiate legislative projects instead of only being able to demand proposals from the Commission, as has been the case up to now.
We will also give citizens the opportunity to have a direct say in the leadership of the European Commission by casting their vote on election day, by advocating the legal establishment of the Spitzenkandidaten principle. Who can become President of the Commission should be determined in advance in a way that is transparent and visible to all citizens. Then the people of the EU can directly influence the future direction of European policy and make a significant contribution to strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the European Union. We also unite candidates from different member states in one European constituency. These transnational lists would strengthen the European dimension of the European elections and put European issues at the forefront of the election campaign. It goes without saying that we advocate equal representation on electoral lists so that the proportion of women in society is also reflected in the European Parliament.
European policy that listens to the people
Democracy is the guarantor of citizens' trust in the European Union.
institutions and decision-making processes. Only in a strong and vibrant democracy can people freely articulate their wishes and interests and jointly implement them in society. The conference on the future of Europe as an innovative and participatory form of citizen involvement clearly demonstrated the desire for a more effective European Union. We are committed to ensuring that these proposals are also incorporated into European legislation.
In particular, we want to follow the proposal to abolish the principle of unanimity where it is already possible under the existing treaties. In order to implement some of the citizens' more far-reaching proposals, it will be necessary to amend the EU treaties, as they either concern policy areas in which the EU does not yet have any competences or would require a change to the EU's institutional architecture. We are therefore campaigning with our European partners for the establishment of a European Convention.
Creating trust through transparency
We want to ensure that decisions are made in the interests of the common good in order to strengthen citizens' trust in the EU institutions. To this end, we are increasing the transparency and accountability of the EU institutions by advocating the establishment of a strong European ethics authority that sets common ethical standards for all EU institutions and monitors their implementation and compliance.
4. Strategically expanding international partnerships
A strong Europe networks in the world. The European Union needs international cooperation for its prosperity and security. That is why we are strengthening the rules-based international order, coordinating even more closely with our European partners and investing jointly in strategic partnerships. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz has already successfully championed cooperation and the definition of common interests with non-European states within the framework of the G7, the G20 and the United Nations - we are continuing and expanding this commitment.
Making Europe the partner of choice
Many countries in the Global South have turned their backs on the promises of liberal democracies because they do not see their expectations fulfilled. We want Europe to respond to this and win countries back as partners for projects and initiatives that support common values and interests with attractive and fair offers. We want to break up unequal and neoliberal power structures in North-South relations, strengthen human rights and promote democracy and sustainable development. For us, the yardstick for cooperation with international partners is the 17 sustainability goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda jointly adopted by the global community.
Peacekeeping and peacebuilding
Many countries around the world see Europe not only as a partner for security and prosperity, but also as a partner for peace. It is time for Europe to take on more responsibility for peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Conflicts and wars often have social, economic and ecological causes. These must be recognized and combated at an early stage.
A feminist foreign and peace policy that takes all members of a society into account and urges the overcoming of patriarchal and post-colonial power structures is an indispensable basis for this. In conflicts, gender-specific violence and other mechanisms of oppression against women occur structurally time and again.
We are therefore committed to the rights, resources and representation of women, girls and girls' organizations.
marginalized groups in all their diversity and support feminist movements, for example in Iran. Since the murder of Jîna Amini by the Iranian morality police, many critics of the regime in Iran have been fighting against the mullah regime and for a self-determined life.
The mullah regime reacts to these protests with brute force, imprisoning and torturing protesters. In 2023 alone, 600 people were executed by the regime. We want to show solidarity with the courageous freedom fighters in Iran and stand firmly by their side.
International cultural and education policy are further important factors in conflict prevention. It is therefore crucial to involve civil society and, above all, to promote civil conflict prevention more extensively. In this way, we are investing in sustainably positive experiences with Europe and promoting educational and cultural projects,
cultural and scientific exchange. We will campaign for sufficient funding. Strengthening the transatlantic partnership
The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has made transatlantic commonalities more prominent than they have been for a long time. The USA is Europe's most important security partner worldwide and one of its most important economic and trading partners. We want to further deepen trade relations, for example by making better use of the structures of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council. The long- term goal is a common transatlantic economic area with fair trading conditions in which industrial tariffs are abolished, market access barriers for future technologies, especially decarbonization, digitalization and the circular economy, are removed and common standards are set.
Common European policy on China
For us, China is a partner, competitor and system rival. Key global challenges cannot be overcome without China. China's significance as an important sales market for European companies is high. At the same time, European companies are competing with Chinese companies for market share and innovation - and China is working to restructure the international system in its favor. We want Europe to speak with one voice for its interests and values and therefore call for the development of a clear and consistent European strategy for relations with China that integrates existing concepts and decisions and adapts them where necessary. We want to drive forward cooperation on global challenges, promote respect for and the universal validity of human rights and strengthen multilateralism. At the same time, we need a European resilience strategy that reduces risks (de-risking), also with a view to protecting critical infrastructure in Europe. We need to diversify our economic relations in order to minimize economic dependencies, especially in the procurement of raw materials according to the "China plus one" principle, where we always have alternative suppliers in addition to China. This also includes prohibiting the import of products from forced labor in addition to the European Supply Chain Act.
Advancing the reform of the United Nations
In order to overcome the challenges of our time - poverty, climate change, loss of biodiversity, migration, pandemics, wars - global answers are needed. These can only emerge within the framework of a rules- based international order. We therefore want to work together towards functioning multilateral institutions and international agreements. We want to further strengthen the EU's cooperation within the United Nations. We want the United Nations Security Council to become more representative. We therefore advocate a reform of the Security Council, in which the Security Council is initially expanded to include nation states, especially from the Global South.
We want to create more participation rights for the European Union in the UN. We also want to strengthen the World Health Organization politically and financially. As a lesson from the pandemic years, we want to
We will establish short-term and long-term cooperation that ensures global sharing of technology, necessary knowledge, data and information. Together, we will be better prepared for future pandemics and the impact of climate change on the healthcare system.
Thinking development cooperation more in European terms
The EU - together with its member states - is already the world's largest donor in development cooperation and the largest promoter of democracy. We want to expand this position - both in the interests of our partner countries and in our own interests, as it is a long-term investment to achieve the 2030 Agenda and ensure prosperity and security. We are committed to the target of spending at least 0.7 percent of gross national income on development cooperation. A special focus must be placed on the least developed countries (LDCs). A feminist approach is also important to us in development policy. Projects should be further developed together with our partners in the Global South and with a particular focus on social, ecological and gender-specific inequalities and the fight against climate change. We are committed to a common approach to our global development cooperation and want to better pool our strengths at European level.
We therefore want to further enhance the role of the Commissioner for International Partnerships and strengthen the supervisory function of the European Parliament to ensure that development policy projects are implemented in a targeted manner.
The European Global Gateway initiative needs a new start, also in order to be a visible response to China's Belt and Road Initiative (New Silk Road). To this end, we want to better coordinate and bundle the funding of infrastructure projects. European investments in future-relevant infrastructure must come from a single source. We will ensure that the investments are developed and implemented together with the partner countries in order to be sustainable and effective on the ground. Successful projects, such as the new transport corridor between India and Europe initiated by us and our partners at the G20 summit in New Delhi, demonstrate the geopolitical relevance of such offensives.
Creating financial space for development
Together with our European partners, we advocate greater tax justice, transparency and information rights as well as global minimum taxation so that our international partners in particular can use the added value they have achieved to invest in their future. We advocate conditional debt relief programs in which the savings from the haircut are invested specifically in social and sustainable projects. We therefore need a debt haircut for the countries of the Global South that includes state, intergovernmental and private institutions.
We also want to establish further investment partnerships in order to bundle public and private investment for the development of sustainable value creation structures and enable socio-ecological growth through progressive regulation. In doing so, we ensure that the focus is on the goal of combating inequality.
5. A new direction for European trade policy
Europe's sustainable development and good jobs in Germany depend to a large extent on trade. At the same time, we know that The neoliberal dream that trade automatically leads to prosperity gains for all, political change and greater security in the world has come to an end. Moreover, in our globalized world, economic means are increasingly being used to settle geopolitical conflicts. We therefore need a progressive trade policy that improves the realities of people's lives - not only in Europe, but also in our trading partners. We want a strong Europe that is resilient and uses economic policy tools strategically to protect our
values and interests.
Diversify trading partners - especially in the commodities sector
The recent crises have made it clear that Europe suffers from one-sided dependencies in sensitive areas - be it imports of energy sources, raw materials, rare earths or medicines. This is why we want to diversify our trading partners and supply chains and thus create a resilient Europe that will be able to withstand future crises. A particular focus here is on raw materials, which are central to the socio-ecological transformation. We therefore need equal cooperation with resource-rich countries. This cooperation must consider the political interests and economic development needs of our partners as central - both sides must benefit from raw materials partnerships. Developing and emerging countries in particular must be enabled to create more of their own local value added, including through targeted support. In line with the Supply Chain Act, we take care to avoid negative impacts on human rights, the environment and the climate.
Anchoring enforceable standards in European trade agreements
Trade agreements that only aim to reduce customs barriers and liberalize markets are no longer in keeping with the times. Instead, we want comprehensive trade and investment agreements that include binding social (e.g. ILO-
core labor standards, governance conventions), human rights and environmental standards for the protection of workers and the environment as well as concrete complaint, review and follow-up mechanisms, which we implement jointly and on an equal footing with our trading partners. Our aim is to ensure that digital rights are also enshrined in trade agreements in times of global technological change. At the same time, we consider sector-specific trade cooperation (such as the US-EU-
Trade and Technology Council) in order to set global standards and expand strategic partnerships. Expanding competencies and instruments in the field of geoeconomics
We are committed to a European Union that pools its competences in foreign trade policy and protects and defends sovereign European decisions. We want to analyze our economic relations and dependencies continuously, proactively and in depth so that we can identify risks at an early stage. We will also continue to work on a broad range of geo-economic instruments that are necessary to respond to different challenges. The introduction of the trade instrument against economic coercion, which we Social Democrats are pushing for, is an important addition to the toolbox in this respect. With these instruments, we not only want to give the European Union the opportunity to assert itself as a geopolitical player, but also to take on this role and fill it with life.
Strengthening international rules for trade
We are committed to free, fair and rules-based global trade. We want to drive forward the reform of the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement system and the inclusion of climate and human rights objectives in the rules and standards of international trade. We will work to update the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures to effectively manage the growing global subsidy race. It is crucial to create a framework that increases transparency on the actual use of subsidies, which is also a crucial step towards regulating this race.
6. A refugee policy based on solidarity
Many people around the world continue to be forced to leave their homes. They are fleeing violence, terror and persecution. The vast majority of them seek protection as internally displaced persons in other parts of their country or in neighboring countries in their region. For quite a few, however, the European Union is also the place to finally find safety and peace. Despite the many challenges it faces, the community of 27 member states remains a stronghold of the rule of law and humanity. With this in mind, we want to strengthen the European Union so that, as a strong community, it can provide a humanitarian response to the people who need our protection and refuge.
Maintaining humanitarian responsibility
From our own history, the right to asylum, as a cornerstone of social democratic policy, is firmly anchored in our fundamental values and is non-negotiable for us. For us, there is no doubt that those in need of protection should be given refuge. Our migration policy is therefore based on the fundamental principle of humanity. At the same time, in order to obtain approval for an asylum and refugee policy based on the principle of humanity, we also need order and control in migration. All member states of the European Union, without exception, must naturally fulfill their European and international legal obligations with regard to refugee policy. We demand that the responsibility of the European Union is actually borne in solidarity in accordance with the regulations and obligations signed by all member states.
A Common European Asylum System based on solidarity
It is good that, after years of dispute, the member states of the European Union and the European Parliament have agreed on a reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). This important ability of the European Union to unite must now prove itself in practice. We want a common system that no longer exists only on paper, but is adequately supported by all member states and helps people seeking protection in practice. For the SPD, the following is unequivocal: the individual human right to asylum and international refugee law are the irrefutable basis for this Common European Asylum System. This was and is non-negotiable for us. We therefore make it clear that a fair asylum procedure with high constitutional standards must also always be guaranteed in border procedures.
Special protection for unaccompanied minor refugees and families
We were able to ensure that minors traveling alone are generally exempt from border procedures. We also campaigned for the exemption to also apply to families with children and other vulnerable groups. It has been achieved that child-friendly accommodation must be guaranteed for families with children in border procedures. However, we still want families with children, as well as other vulnerable groups, to be excluded from border procedures as a matter of principle. It is therefore good that the European Asylum Agency is obliged to pay particular attention to the reception conditions for these groups. If it becomes apparent that child-friendly care cannot be guaranteed here, immediate action must be taken and families with children must be excluded from border procedures. We demand the same for other vulnerable groups, such as queer people seeking protection.
For us, the examination of individual asylum claims is paramount and not the blanket categorization by country of origin. We will closely monitor the human rights situation at the EU's external border. We want to prevent serious abuses and the creation of precarious camps so that disasters like the one in Moria do not happen again.
Ensuring legal protection in border proceedings too
For us, it remains crucial that the unrestricted and individual right to asylum and humanitarian conditions are also safeguarded in border procedures. Persons seeking protection whose asylum application is being examined in an accelerated asylum procedure must therefore be given the opportunity to obtain legal advice and legal counsel on a regular basis. The intended acceleration of the asylum procedure must by no means lead to restrictions on legal protection. We continue to advocate that appeals should always have a suspensive effect.
We demand compliance with all humanitarian and constitutional rules when ensuring the EU's external border protection. We make it clear: pushbacks are a blatant violation of international law. Tolerance by or even involvement of member state authorities or Frontex must not be permitted under any circumstances. Illegal pushbacks must be stopped and sanctioned immediately. We therefore expressly support independent monitoring of all national activities in the context of migration and asylum. In particular, the European Border Agency must investigate and, wherever possible, prevent human rights violations. To ensure that the EU's external borders are secure and governed by the rule of law, a comprehensive review of the systematic and structural problems of the largest EU agency is still required.
Duty of solidarity
The agreed duty of solidarity of all member states is a major step with which the European Union as a whole is fulfilling its humanitarian responsibility. This applies in particular to those member states - such as Germany - that have taken in large numbers of people seeking protection. This duty of solidarity must therefore be enforced by all member states from now on. In order to support municipalities that show solidarity in particular, we are calling for an additional fund at European level for the reception of refugees and for the necessary municipal infrastructure.
High standards and regular review of the security situation in countries of origin
It follows from the individual right to asylum that the grounds for asylum are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. People seeking protection must always have the opportunity to appeal effectively against negative asylum decisions. General assessments of the security situation in the countries of origin, which are taken into account in asylum procedures, must be regularly reviewed on the basis of reliable, constitutional criteria.
More paths for legal labor migration to Europe
Many people who apply for protection in the European Union have set off to work here. It must be clear that this is the wrong approach. At the same time, we need to create and demonstrate more ways of gaining access to the European labor market from third countries. Because in many places in Europe there is an acute shortage of workers, and not only (more) in the highly qualified sector. We therefore want to expand the existing options (e.g. EU Blue Card) and quickly harmonize national access options. The Skilled Immigration Act created in Germany, which is explicitly not only aimed at highly qualified workers, could serve as a model here. In addition, an ordinary work permit issued by a member state should also extend to the possibility of working in other member states (after a certain period of time, for example). We want to make it easier to issue EU visas for training or qualification purposes.
Creating safer and legal escape routes
We want to create legal access routes for refugees. The targeted admission of people directly from UNHCR reception camps (resettlement) plays an important role in this. Corresponding
Programs are already possible on a voluntary basis. We want more use to be made of this easily manageable and controllable measure. It is clear that we defend the individual right to asylum in Europe and reject the outsourcing of the asylum system to third countries. Safer escape routes are also needed to prevent deaths, especially in the Mediterranean. This is why we continue to advocate humanitarian visas, among other things: People with a history of persecution should receive a cursory preliminary asylum check at European Union diplomatic missions abroad in order to spare them the life-threatening journey across the Mediterranean.
Fighting the causes of flight
Violent conflicts, state repression, discrimination and massive human rights violations, poverty and the effects of climate change are among the most important triggers of refugee movements. Development policy measures that reduce a country's vulnerability to crises and improve social cohesion therefore make an important contribution to reducing the causes of displacement. That is why we want Germany to provide more support in stabilizing the political and economic situation, rebuilding structures destroyed by conflict and improving education and employment opportunities.
We want a fair world trade, currency and financial system that does not take advantage of the Global South, but instead ensures that value creation increases in the countries concerned, thus creating and maintaining the basis for a good local life.
The vast majority of people seek protection as internally displaced persons or in neighboring countries in their region. In many cases, these regions are also characterized by conflicts and fragile structures. We want the EU to show solidarity with these countries by supporting them in providing for refugees and migrants and preventing social and economic distribution conflicts with the local population.
We are committed to ensuring that EU funds are used much more where they are effective and where support is urgently needed: in the host countries, for the development of long-term structures and for human rights protection. We call for at least half of these funds to flow into long-term investments for the protection and care of refugees in host countries and the expansion of regular migration routes.
End deaths in the Mediterranean: Sea rescue and safe escape routes
The deaths in the Mediterranean must stop. Sea rescue is an obligation under international maritime law. Civilian sea rescuers who take on this task and humanitarian responsibility to save people in distress must therefore not be criminalized and will continue to be supported by us. Ultimately, we want sea rescue within the EU to be guaranteed by the state and safer escape routes to be created.
Relieving the burden on municipalities
The successful relaunch of the Common European Asylum System can only succeed if the new rules are implemented comprehensively everywhere. By introducing a European integration and municipal development fund, cities and municipalities that agree to take in refugees should receive financial support for integration costs and an equal amount for municipal development costs. Within this framework, citizens should also have a say in the organization of the reception of refugees. At the same time, we are implementing harmonized European rules for access to training and work. This applies to an extension of the so-called EU Blue Card, but also to simplified rules for longer-term stays in the EU.
IV. A Europe of respect
We want a European Union that stands firmly together. Even and especially when times are challenging. The basis for this is a Europe of respect. On the basis of our common values of freedom, democracy, peace and justice, we want prosperity for the many, not just the few. For us, respect means respecting and protecting different ways of life. It doesn't matter what your social or geographical background is, how you live and who you love, whether you are young or old, an academic or an unskilled worker. Because we have respect for each and every individual, we ensure equal opportunities, a right to participation, good education and good work. These are the foundations for a self-determined life. Respect therefore also means ensuring good work, combined with the promise of solidarity.
We are Germans with regional roots, but we are also Europeans. Both fill us with equal pride. The European Union is our common ground, which allows us to be different without fear or dreaming. With its shared values, the European Union creates identity. We are confidently building the future of the European Union on this common identity. In contrast, the right-wing populist policy of exclusion and demarcation misuses the enriching diversity in the EU as a bogeyman. It is disrespectful and misanthropic. We stand firm and united against their negativity with its seemingly simple, unsuitable answers, but especially against their lies and hatred.
It is the shared values that we live by that allow all member states to come together as equals in the European Union - regardless of their size, economic power or even military strength. Respect for the individual is the historical uniqueness of the European Union. We want to strengthen it for the benefit and well-being of all EU citizens.
1. Ensuring good work
From our history of the labor movement, it is clear to us that true respect for employees can only arise if they can collectively represent and negotiate their interests on an equal footing. This applies on both a small and large scale. Nevertheless, we as a state have a responsibility to ensure good framework conditions, as well as basic rules on occupational health and safety and wages. For the SPD, the central prerequisite for shaping a good future for all Europeans is that all the changes ahead of us can only be shaped together with employees and their trade unions. This requires strong co-determination in Germany and Europe, a high level of collective bargaining coverage and an active structural and labor market policy that focuses on the interests of employees.
Strengthening social rights
We do not want precarious work in Europe, we want good work. To this end, we will continue to resolutely implement the European Pillar of Social Rights at both national and European level. With common minimum standards for labor markets and social policy, the European Union has taken an important step towards harmonizing living conditions in Europe. This has also led to improvements in Germany (compliance with collective bargaining in public procurement law, minimum wage directive...), which would never have been implemented without social democracy. We want to continue on this right common path. To this end, we will also anchor the criteria for good work even more firmly in European structural policy, in the structural funds and in regional aid. Here we want to anchor collective bargaining, occupational health and safety and opportunities for training and further education as fixed components of the rules for awarding contracts.
Fair pay for all
Anyone who works full-time must be able to live off their pay. The EU Minimum Wage Directive was an important step in this direction. It obliges the member states to draw up action plans to increase collective bargaining coverage. The aim is for 80 percent of employees to be covered by collective agreements. Collective pay should be the rule. It ensures better pay and working conditions. Europe can do more to further strengthen national collective bargaining coverage. To this end, the allocation of EU funds should in future be more closely linked to conditions such as good work and
collective agreements. By including a mandatory collective bargaining clause, we will therefore be able to amend the concession and public procurement laws.
further develop directives. We are also fighting for a legal status for European artists and other self- employed workers with EU-wide standards for their minimum remuneration, working conditions and social security.
Digital dividend for all
Digital productivity gains must lead to a reduction in working hours for all employees and not to an intensification of work. Co-determination must also be strengthened in connection with the digital transformation. We want to involve employees' expertise to a greater extent when it comes to the digitalization of processes or even the use of artificial intelligence. Our aim is to strengthen the sovereignty and self-determination of employees.
Better protect employees from exploitation
Freedom of movement and fair mobility belong together. We want to improve the social rights of mobile EU citizens and protect them from exploitation and discrimination. That is why we are campaigning for a single European social security number and a digital social security passport. The reform of the coordination of social security systems must ensure the social protection of mobile workers and effectively combat abuse. We also want to ensure that more decisive action is taken against wage theft, wage and social security fraud and that minimum standards for accommodation put an end to the undignified accommodation of mobile workers. We want to achieve more national and European controls, stronger coordination and the expansion of fair mobility advice centers throughout Europe in order to improve the situation of workers. This also includes extending the mandate of the European Employment Agency to monitor workers from third countries, subcontractor chains, private employment agencies, better access to data and more powers for cross-border inspections. The principle of "equal pay for equal work in the same place" must be enforced in all member states. We need an ambitious directive on platform work that creates a framework to combat bogus self-employment and strengthen collective rights. We are committed to fair working conditions and fair competition in the European logistics sector, especially for truck drivers. We also want an EU directive on protection against mental stress in order to respond to the increase in stress, work intensification and time pressure.
For a European supply chain law
We also want to make our contribution outside the European Union to fair working conditions, the protection of human rights, environmental protection and the fight against climate change. The German Supply Chain Act is an important first step here, which we are supplementing with a strong European Supply Chain Act. In this way, we want to prevent products that are manufactured using forced labor or exploiting people and nature from entering the European single market in the first place. That is why we support the regulation on a ban on products manufactured using forced labor, with strong powers for the EU Commission.
Good work through strong employee rights
Co-determination is a key element in strengthening democracy in companies and workplaces. Co- determined companies are more innovative and more successful. We therefore want to strengthen co- determination. With an EU
framework directive on information, consultation and co-determination, the patchwork of different co- determination rules should be consolidated. In addition, democracy in the workplace must be strengthened as part of a reform of European company law. If national thresholds for the validity of co- determination are subsequently exceeded, there must be an obligation to renegotiate. We also want to strengthen European Works Councils (EWCs) within the framework of the directive. This applies above all to access to justice, the definition of cross-border issues and appropriate sanctions.
Strengthening the European social partnership
As in Germany, we also want trade unions and employers at European level to actively take advantage of the opportunity to shape European social and employment policy. To this end, we will strengthen social dialog within the framework of the European social model: joint agreements between the social partners should be swiftly translated into binding legislation. Europe needs an economy that serves the people.
That is why the fundamental social rights of the European Union must finally be given priority over fundamental economic freedoms.
We also make it clear that the right to strike must not be undermined; it is part of a strong internal market. Good (education) training
A good education is a prerequisite for a successful professional life. Good education and training should not depend on a person's background, gender, disability or the parents' financial and social situation.
Following on from the European Education Area 2025 initiatives, we are therefore committed to a genuine European education revolution. We want to guarantee all children in the EU inclusive, equal and high- quality primary and secondary education by 2030. At the same time, we are calling for a binding quality framework and adequate funding for the Youth Guarantee, according to which all young people in the EU should be offered a high-quality job, apprenticeship, further education or internship within four months of leaving school or becoming unemployed. It is also important to us to ensure that internships are remunerated in order to strengthen the rights of young people. At the same time, we want to facilitate the cross-border placement of apprenticeships and jobs. We are also committed to greater broad-based support for European universities that benefits all students. Our goal remains fee-free education from nursery school to apprenticeships and first degree courses through to master's degrees. We are striving to achieve this at EU level.
far ahead. The Bologna reform was intended to create a common European higher education area
- with comparable degrees and greater student mobility. We are working within the EU to ensure that these goals continue to be consistently achieved. We want a significant increase in investment in education and are particularly committed to strengthening the European Solidarity Corps and ERASMUS+. Our aim is to ensure that everyone who wants to can have at least one ERASMUS+-funded learning experience abroad by the age of 25. We also support European and international youth associations in their political and cultural education work. Cross-border projects and encounters in particular actively help to break down prejudices and allow young people to experience the growing together of Europe.
Europe.
2. Guaranteeing social security
More than one in five EU citizens is at risk of poverty and social exclusion. Poverty divides the continent and weakens cohesion. Building a European social union is therefore a key concern for us. Social Europe must be strengthened and brought into balance with fundamental economic freedoms. We therefore advocate a social progress protocol to be annexed to the European treaties. The European Pillar of Social Rights and the goals developed from it at the Social Summit in Porto 2021 will continue to guide our actions in the next legislative period. Strong social security systems support people in times of change and enable them to live in dignity. We want to set the right framework conditions for this.
Common standards for basic security systems
We want solid social security networks to be available in all member states of the European Union. We therefore advocate a framework directive to define minimum standards for the respective national basic social security systems. Minimum security benefits must provide adequate, poverty-proof income support as well as support services for (re-)integration into the labor market.
)integration into the labor market. In this way, we create the conditions for reducing involuntary and poverty-related migration within the European Union.
Protection from child poverty
Special efforts are also needed to protect children and young people affected by poverty if we want to achieve the goals agreed in Porto: to lift five million children out of poverty in the EU by 2030. We will therefore effectively support the national implementation of the European Child Guarantee and provide sufficient EU funding for this within the framework of the European Social Fund. In addition, the social funds must be better funded in the coming funding period. This will also benefit our social democratic idea of a basic child guarantee, especially for the expansion of infrastructure for education and participation.
Introduction of a European disability card
The new strategy for people with disabilities aims to further promote equal opportunities and equal access to participation in social and economic life. We are committed to a European Disability Card and the improvement of the European Parking Card for people with disabilities with the aim of removing barriers to participation and promoting equal opportunities.
to make use of compensation for disadvantages in the areas of mobility, culture, leisure and sport. In this way, the rights of people with disabilities are to be asserted in all European member states.
Affordable housing, especially in cities
Our aim is to ensure natural access to good, barrier-free and affordable housing. We want to create liveable city centers with a sufficient supply of affordable, long-term rental apartments. In doing so, we are countering the ongoing shortage and the resulting sharp rise in rents. The EU must provide greater support for investment in affordable, social and energy-efficient housing and give member states sufficient leeway to make the necessary investments in social housing. We also need more European flexibility in the granting of state housing subsidies. In addition, we want to further strengthen the European exchange between national players. Rental housing, not
Vacation apartments must be the norm in cities. That is why we are backing local authorities that restrict the conversion of rental apartments into vacation homes and are committed to giving cities with tight housing markets the option of limiting short-term rentals. European legislation is needed to put a stop to the worst excesses of conversions and to protect tenants in tight housing markets. We will also focus on the growing market for furnished rented apartments in order to prevent this from undermining regulations for affordable housing. We want to expand the opportunities to use EU funds to promote the creation of affordable housing, particularly for young people.
Overcoming homelessness in Germany and Europe
Our goal is to end homelessness in Germany and Europe by 2030. That is why we support the European Platform to Combat Homelessness. We are convinced that the solution to the often complex problems of homeless people must start with a home of their own. This Housing First
We support this approach and want to expand it further. In addition, the SPD is committed to ensuring that the topic is given even greater priority in the new Commission.
3. Access to good healthcare
Everyone in Europe should have safe access to the necessary medicines and the latest therapies at affordable prices. The coronavirus pandemic has shown how important a coordinated approach among the member states can be. We therefore want Europe-wide networked and patient-oriented health prevention and care. To achieve this, we need a strong European Health Union. Together, we can combat supply bottlenecks, ensure fair prices for medicines and strengthen the care sector.
Preventive measures to combat supply bottlenecks
We want to sustainably combat supply bottlenecks, especially for critical active ingredients or vaccines. To this end, we are committed to the EU
pharmaceutical legislation to further develop preventive mechanisms such as monitoring, shortage management plans and reporting obligations. We advocate a European instrument for monitoring and identifying drug shortages and increasing transparency in the supply and authenticity of medicines.
Fair prices for medicines
We want more joint European procurement of medicinal products in order to achieve the best price- performance ratio. Ensuring access to medical innovations for all EU citizens also requires a Europe-wide, fair system of pharmaceutical pricing and benefit assessment. We advocate a system based on solidarity that is geared towards the political, market and economic framework conditions and the purchasing power of the European partner countries and, where applicable, other purchasing countries.
Good and safe care at home and on the move
To ensure the cross-border treatment of patients in the European Union, we need Europe-wide interoperability of health data with secure and uniform standards. In doing so, we will ensure that patients always retain control over their health data. In the future, we want to further facilitate access to treatment and the free choice of doctor for short-term stays in other EU countries, whether as a tourist or seasonal worker, and ensure simple and fast digital access to health data.
More effective use of billing for treatment in other EU countries. Further strengthening of care
With the European long-term care strategy, we have brought the issues of care and support into focus and thought them through together. We now want to implement the strategy consistently, in particular through more state investment in the care sector and the introduction of binding European regulations.
To this end, we want to transform informal work into formal work and ensure regular and good working conditions and combat precarious working conditions, particularly for women in private households.
More incentives for innovation and increased fight against resistance
We want to create new incentives for research and the development of urgently needed novel antibiotics. At the same time, we want stronger oversight of antibiotic use to respond to the increasing cross-border health threat of growing resistance. To this end, we will advocate for the full implementation of the European One Health Action Plan against antimicrobial resistance and increased cooperation with our international partners with the aim of achieving a global agreement on the use of and access to antimicrobials. We will also work to ensure that the chronic consequences of infections are made a priority
- people suffering from Long Covid, Post Vac and ME/CFS, for example, urgently need approved medicines and deserve our solidarity. As part of the European research program, we will continue to advocate for the advancement of gender-specific medical research and the expansion of therapy development in the field
o f autoimmune diseases.
4. Ensuring a non-discriminatory society
A Europe of respect is a discrimination-free Europe, because discrimination-free societies are happier, healthier, more resilient, more prosperous, safer and, above all, fairer. Nevertheless, we are increasingly seeing attempts to undermine the rights of women, people with disabilities and LGBTIQ+ people in some member states. Group-focused misanthropy, homophobia, racism and anti-Semitism are poison for good and peaceful coexistence.
These anti-human and anti-democratic tendencies are visible within the EU and worldwide. We will not accept and allow conservative and right-wing governments to question and attack the rights we have fought for. Women's rights, the rights of people of color as well as the rights of people with disabilities and LGBTIQ+ people are human rights. We have achieved a lot in Germany and Europe in recent years and decades - but by no means everything.
Developing the EU Charter on Women's Rights
We call for an EU Charter of Women's Rights. We need a catalog of fundamental rights to be protected, absolute minimum standards, such as universal access to contraception, sexual and reproductive health and rights, including reproductive self-determination and safe and legal abortions as well as sex and relationship education. We also strive to ensure that there is free, low-threshold access to abortifacients such as the "morning-after pill" in the long term. Safe abortions should also be available free of charge to as many people as possible in the EU in order to ensure reproductive self-determination and health. The aim must be to protect, expand and enshrine rights. The right to safe and legal abortion should also be enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Renewing European equality strategies
The European Gender Equality Strategy must continue to be implemented effectively, particularly in the form of qualitative and quantitative measures that strengthen women's participation in the labor market. The LGBTIQ equality strategy, which now exists for the first time from 2020 to 2025, must also be consistently implemented and continuously developed. Both strategies should be renewed for the period from 2025 to 2030, taking into account previous experience and with their own budget.
Economic independence for women creates social justice
We want to close the gender gap in employment, pay and social security in order to strengthen women's economic independence. Above all, we need high-quality jobs as well as fair wages and pensions. We are proud that we were able to push through the European directive on pay transparency, which means that more women receive their fair pay. However, there is still a need for implementation, especially with the German Pay Transparency Act. In order to close the gender pay gap, we are campaigning for an EU directive on anti-discrimination in wages in addition to the implementation of the directive on pay transparency. Because it is clear to us that pay transparency alone does not do justice to our social democratic aspirations. We want equal pay for equal work in the same place in the European Union. The adopted minimum wage directive will also ensure that women in particular, who often work in the low- wage sector, are better protected from poverty. We also want to close the gender gap in care and support. Care work is still a woman's job and must not remain so. We are therefore striving for the "equal carer - equal earner" model, i.e. a gender equality-oriented employment and care model.
Getting more women into management positions
We empower women in the economy, especially as founders of companies and start-ups. We ensure that women are more fairly represented in decision-making processes in politics and in companies. Quotas and zipper lists, but also a better gender-sensitive political culture and corporate culture are suitable measures here. The EU Leadership Directive (2022) is a milestone for gender equality in Europe. It strengthens the position of women on supervisory boards and paves the way for them to join the management boards of listed companies. As a next step, we plan to look at the management boards of all companies based in the European Union.
Tax equality
Women consume differently and have lower incomes - but bear a higher VAT burden. We are committed to ensuring that the tax burden is finally distributed more fairly. This ranges from reduced tax rates in the EU on feminine hygiene products to the abolition of the additional price on products and services for women (pink tax). In other words, we ensure that equivalent products and services cost the same for men and women.
Fighting and preventing violence against women together
In order to end male violence against women, we must address, analyze and break down harmful norms, structures and stereotypes, promote sex education in schools and offer Europe-wide violence prevention through gender-sensitive educational programs for boys and girls. Only a rethinking of society as a whole and the anchoring of modern role models will promote the equal perception of women in all areas of society and thus also put an end to violence.
The adoption of the Istanbul Convention is a strong signal from the EU that common values are non- negotiable - including women's rights. It must be a matter of course in all member states of the European Union to take consistent action against gender-based violence. The Istanbul Convention must therefore be ratified in all EU member states and the provisions must be transposed into national law.
right can be transferred.
The directive on combating gender-based violence is also an important step towards establishing Europe- wide minimum standards for the protection of women. We want to go further and are campaigning for gender-based violence to be recognized as a European-wide criminal offence in order to be able to combat all forms of violence against women even more comprehensively in the future.
Protect against human trafficking and exploitation
We want to continue Europe's joint fight against human trafficking and adapt the existing legislation to the latest challenges in this area. A key objective must be to protect women who are trafficked into and within the EU for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
Equality and parity in the European institutions too
We are striving for gender parity in the new EU Commission and will ensure that a female Commissioner is once again explicitly responsible for the topic of equality - equality between women and men, anti- discrimination and LGBTQI+ rights. We are also committed to further strengthening the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). The EU budget should be set up in a gender-equitable way using the instrument of gender budgeting.
Protecting the rights of queer people
The European Union guarantees the freedom of queer people. This has been expressly decided by the European Parliament with the support of the Social Democrats. The declaration and support of the "LGBTIQ+ Freedom Zone" follows a concern that steps taken towards the freedom of queer people are acutely endangered. We stand in the way of any discrimination and hostility. We call on the EU Commission, as guardian of the treaties, to react harshly to the anti-LGBTIQ+ actions of individual member states. They are incompatible with the values of the European Union. They must be stopped and reversed. We also demand that European rainbow families are not hindered in their freedom of movement and that registered civil partnerships and same-sex marriages are recognized throughout the EU.
Protecting national minorities
In accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, we are committed to protecting national minorities in Germany and Europe and support measures to preserve their cultural heritage.
An age-appropriate Europe
Active and healthy ageing has a positive impact on society, the labor market, social systems and productivity. We therefore campaign against age discrimination and want to help people to lead their lives independently for as long as possible and to b e able to participate in society.
5. Protecting security and freedom
Respect also means living without fear of crime and being allowed to be different without fear. All Europeans should feel safe in the EU and have the freedom to inform themselves independently and form their own opinions. To this end, we want to protect the independence of the media and take more effective action against disinformation. Crime often takes place across borders, which is why our national police and security authorities must cooperate even better. We want to set rules at European level to strengthen European consumer protection in the single market. In view of an increase in climate change- related disasters, in addition to other emergencies, we also want to improve civil protection by working even more closely with our European partners and, where appropriate, managing them centrally.
Ensuring freedom of the media
Media freedom is an essential part of the fundamental rights of European citizens. In recent years, we have seen how pressure has been exerted on the media in Europe and how European values have been violated. It is therefore high time to strengthen the independence of the media in all member states and to push back state influence where it is abused.
Governments must not be allowed to influence the reporting of public and private media or exert pressure on journalists. To this end, we are further developing joint instruments to protect the independence of the media and ensuring that non-governmental and civil society organizations are directly supported wherever democracy and the rule of law are under particular pressure. To this end, we are working towards a special fund for democracy and the rule of law.
Strengthening cross-border cooperation between security authorities
We want increased cross-border cooperation between police forces and security authorities in the European Union. This includes, in particular, strengthening Europol in supporting the member states. Cooperation should focus primarily on combating economic and cybercrime. It should also focus on trafficking in weapons, drugs and human beings, with a particular emphasis on sexualized violence against children and violence against women. It also remains the case that we can only counter extremist or terrorist acts of violence together as a European Union. To ensure that cross-border work works even better, we are committed to continuous training and further training with the same standards, e.g. with the help of the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training. We also want to strengthen judicial cooperation at EU level. This applies to the European Union Agency for Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters (Eurojust), as well as to the expansion of common channels for the secure exchange of data. Further attention will be paid to combating money laundering with the planned anti-money laundering agency AMLA. With regard to the planned European anti-money laundering
AMLA agency, we are committed to the Frankfurt location. Strengthening the European Public Prosecutor's Office
The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) is an important authority in the fight against
(tax) fraud, corruption and money laundering. We are striving for all EU member states to quickly join the authority, in addition to the current 22 member states. We want to further strengthen the work of the EPPO by providing sufficient financial and human resources for its work. We want to e n s u r e better coordination between the national prosecution authorities, as well as in cooperation with European agencies such as Europol, Eurojust and the EPPO.
Facilitating the seizure of assets
The war in Ukraine has made it clear that increased European cooperation is also essential when it comes to investigating war crimes, punishing non-compliance with EU sanctions or confiscating and freezing the assets of oligarchs or members of organized crime.
Expanding European civil protection and strengthening crisis competencies
In the face of multiple crises and major disasters, we are committed to a European resilience strategy. It should encompass different types of challenges, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics and other emergencies. We want to further strengthen the Emergency Response Coordination Center (ERCC) and better link it to the civil protection structures of the member states. There must be no bottlenecks in the European Union in the
supply of critical goods. When exercising crisis competences, the Commission must be subject to genuine parliamentary control. It may not exercise emergency powers without the active consent of the European Parliament.
Strengthening European consumer protection
The abolition of roaming charges, uniform charging cables and high standards for consumer and environmental protection are just a few examples that reflect the power of 450 million consumers in Europe. As citizens, we must be able to make informed decisions in order to actively contribute to tackling climate change and ensure fair coexistence. That is why we want to limit the opportunities for manipulation on the internet, which are far too often used to trick consumers into making decisions that they subsequently regret (dark patterns. Investment decisions are also often misguided by false incentives from intermediaries. We therefore advocate a ban on commission for the brokerage of financial services.
Empowered consumers need effective market supervisory authorities and a competition watchdog at their side that puts consumer protection first. Consumers must not be made solely responsible for the enforcement of market rules. This is why online marketplaces in particular must be held more accountable, have their own inspection obligations and be held liable for negligence. We want to consistently prohibit dynamic pricing by monopoly companies as an unfair business practice.
Decriminalization of cannabis
We are convinced that a licensed and controlled supply of cannabis will help to reduce the illegal drug trade and minimize health risks. We are committed to the responsible, swift legalization of cannabis in accordance with European law and want to create the legal conditions for this. The protection of health and young people is our top priority.
V. Conclusion
In times when Europe is once again threatened by nationalists and right-wing populists, in times of war on the European continent, in the face of social and economic imbalances and increasingly noticeable climate change, new impetus is needed to strengthen the cohesion of the European Union. As social democrats, we are united in the certainty that we as Europeans can only shape a better future together. In recent years, we have clearly shown that we as Europeans are capable of doing this. But there is still a lot of room for improvement.
For us, there is no either-or. The necessary restructuring of our economy, good jobs for the future, climate protection and support for the many - the SPD brings them all together. We shape progress so that things are fair.
Our Europe is socially and ecologically sustainable. Our Europe is fair, also in its external impact. Our Europe is strong and capable of action. For a better future and for our common security in all areas of life. Our Europe is a strong Europe because it holds together and because it makes people's lives better.

EUROPEAN ELECTORAL PROGRAM 2024-2029 INTRODUCTION
European election program 2024-2029
Our vision for the European Union (EU) is a climate-neutral, innovative, fair and federal Europe. We are convinced that a strong Europe is the solution to overcoming crises.
First of all, the EU needs radical democratic change. This does not just mean a top-down change, but the collective participation of all citizens and the European Parliament. For our defensive democracy, we stand for a European constitution. This will anchor our rights in a new system that is not only more responsive, but also more appealing to everyone.
We are committed to a permanent general citizens' assembly. Here, all European citizens can actively participate in shaping the future and democracy of the EU. This will promote trust, transparency and our European community.
We want to renew the European Parliament. It should b e characterized by transnational parties and have the power to initiate, amend and approve legislation. In this way, governance should be based more on the interests of the citizens than on the concerns of the member states.
Publicly accessible meetings and qualified majority voting must replace outdated veto powers to ensure that decisions are in line with the European Constitution. In this new federal Europe, member states can no longer disregard EU principles. Similarly, the European Court of Justice must have enhanced powers to prevent democratic decay and protect the integrity of the Union.
We want to revive Europol in order to strengthen Europe's internal security and to be able to resolutely counter any threat to Europe's security.
In addition, we believe that the EU must welcome new members who share our commitment to democratic values and human rights. We are laying the foundations for an EU that actively promotes justice and equality, secures European peace and prosperity and prevents social division and the destruction of democracy.
The EU economy must achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2040 by minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and offsetting them with carbon sequestration technologies. Companies and European citizens should actively work together on political goals and thus create a wave of collective action.

EUROPEAN ELECTORAL PROGRAM 2024-2029 INTRODUCTION
This future cannot succeed without the solid foundation of an independent energy supply in the EU. We want to achieve energy self-sufficiency by 2040 by p r o d u c i n g all energy from renewable energy sources, nuclear energy and hydrogen in Europe. In doing so, we represent the idea of a green future for Europe. All citizens should be able to participate in the development of a diverse and flexible energy mix and energy storage infrastructure. In this way, we want to enable a stable and reliable energy supply.
The creation of a green European economy requires a redesign of the EU's infrastructure. This includes sustainability, resilience and convenience. High-speed trains, efficient public transport, clean energy and advanced internet c o n n e c t i v i t y	are the foundation for Europe's future. Our waste management systems must be sustainable and investment in infrastructure must act as a bulwark against the effects of the climate crisis. On the other hand, they should create jobs and boost economic growth.
We therefore strive for economic prosperity and growth that is seamlessly linked to environmental protection and sustainability.
protection. We are redefining growth by introducing a "Green Net GDP". Carbon and resource pricing mechanisms will steer industries towards sustainability. At the same time, the revenues generated should promote innovation and the transition to a greener economy.
A pan-European social contract should ensure that prosperity is a common heritage in which citizens actively shape economic decisions. The first condition for such a treaty is to create equal opportunities. Our goal is a Europe in which every citizen is empowered to develop his or her full potential and does not experience inequality based on social background, disability, ethnicity or religion.
Such efforts must also include a fairer and more transparent system against tax evasion and avoidance. Through global cooperation, high transparency and effective enforcement, we must create a progressive and lean tax system. Every citizen should be able to make a fair contribution and at the same time rely on a fair share being paid. Our vision: breaking down barriers to success and shaping a society in which fairer wealth distribution and equal opportunities thrive.
Inclusion includes a firm commitment to accessible healthcare for all. Above all, we want to offer children a solid foundation for their careers. Young people should be supported through inclusive, gender- and culturally-sensitive education. Daycare centers and preschool programs should improve the opportunities of every child and provide unrestricted support. This applies to every child. The education system should lead us into a future in which primary, secondary and higher education are not luxury goods, but an opportunity for all. Financial resources must do justice to this aspiration and pave the way for a society based on inclusive values.

EUROPEAN ELECTORAL PROGRAM 2024-2029 INTRODUCTION
Our educational concept places the pupils at the center by incorporating interdisciplinary learning and project-based approaches. In our vision, education goes beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge: children should develop into responsible citizens by learning democratic participation, media literacy and critical thinking. Education systems that are harmonized across borders promote a socially united Europe that celebrates cultural differences and enables mobility.
Valuing diversity in Europe requires respectful, dignified and compassionate treatment of migrants and refugees, including climate refugees. We want a continent without deaths in the Mediterranean. A continent where economic migrants are not criminalized and people seeking refuge have not only the right to exist, but equal rights and opportunities. This includes access to essential living conditions, basic healthcare, employment opportunities and education. The latter includes education in the respective national language.
Respect and dignity are the cornerstones of our social policy. This includes robust workers' rights, decent wages, health and safety protection, trade union rights and flexible working arrangements. A comprehensive social safety net should develop and benefit employees, entrepreneurs and freelancers alike. There should be the opportunity to take risks without the threat of financial ruin.
Tackling our challenges at national level alone would not be enough. Our vision for Europe therefore goes beyond mere unity. We call for the EU to become a symbol of strength and diplomacy on the global stage. This includes European armed forces that defend democracy across Europe and beyond its borders and work for solidarity and security. Supported by a common defense budget and targeted, strategic resource management, this development not only secures the interests of Europeans; it also creates independence. At the same time, the principles of democratic accountability are upheld.
A future common EU foreign policy that radiates cohesion and proactivity on a global level is indispensable for this. We call for a European Foreign Minister and a European Foreign Ministry to make decision-making more effective. This is an essential complement to a European army to ensure a feminist foreign policy and open diplomatic channels. In this way, we can bring our interests to the international stage. This will make the EU an important force in multilateral organizations and lead a reformed UN. The EU must take global democracy seriously and speak up for the rights of minorities and the fight for climate justice. We want to use diplomacy and economic resources as instruments to promote peace, security and stability worldwide.

EUROPEAN ELECTORAL PROGRAM 2024-2029 INTRODUCTION
The EU must stand up for those in need of protection and shape a future in which the community stands for positive change. It is our community and our environmental and economic goals that will enable the EU to meet the global challenges of the climate crisis and climate justice. By working consistently with the countries of the world, the EU must not only secure its future, but also pave the way for a stable, low-emission world in which global warming is limited to below 2 degrees by 2040.
The EU must become the global center for climate-positive projects, offering long-term, low-interest loans and incentivizing private capital to secure climate justice. The EU has a responsibility to help global communities transition to sustainable, low-emission pathways and strengthen its commitment to the Paris Agreement. We strive f o r sustainability, resilience and equity that benefits all.
Our Europe should actively promote the economies of non-European countries, eliminate the causes of displacement through sustainable development cooperation, create financial aid and education programs, dismantle networks of illegal migration and put the needs of victims first. Our Europe should ensure legal pathways for both refugees and migrants. We want to create pathways that are standardized in all member states. Inclusion, equal burden-sharing and the free movement of people must be guaranteed.
Our cooperation must be based on democratic values and aim to reduce poverty, conflicts, climate crisis and political instability.
One thing is clear: we must act quickly. The climate crisis, conflicts, overcrowded refugee camps and social resistance will not tolerate any further delay. Together, we can shape a future that offers solutions that are stronger.
We want positive change that not only prevents the worst, but enables the best: a strong, climate- neutral, innovative and fair Europe. Volt is already working across Europe on bold, concrete and constructive solutions. For a Europe in which we not only prevent the climate catastrophe, but also enable a better future: clean i n d u s t r i e s , an innovative economy, social peace and safe coexistence.
But we can only achieve this together.

A STRONGER EU: THE GEOPOLITICAL IMPORTANCE OF EUROPE
1. Europe's path to sustainable prosperity
Today, the EU is the world's largest economic area. This success story is the result of decades of economic integration. The EU's economic weight and global network have enabled significant social progress. This ranges from rising incomes and increased well-being to peace and stability.
We want to grow together economically and implement an urgent renewal of our economic structure. This is necessary to overcome the challenges we face today within Europe and around the world. The climate crisis, geopolitical dependencies, the digital transformation and the social divide that fuels extremist politics are major challenges that we need to solve quickly. We therefore want to promote innovation, ensure effective taxation and conserve resources.
cations for the promotion of sustainability and a fair society within and between States fairly.
As a progressive movement, we do not want to play economic growth, justice and sustainability off against each other. Instead, we promote a vision in which government action simultaneously protects, provides opportunity and drives economic progress. As we strive for long-term prosperity, our way of measuring growth must respect both natural limits and the goal of a just and resilient society.
Research and innovation are key components in the promotion of European, new and established industries. At the same time, they make it possible to counteract global societal challenges such as the climate crisis, digitalization and global health risks. We must create framework conditions for innovative technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and artificial intelligence to enable consumers and companies of all sizes to use them. At the same time, our natural and social limits must be respected (e.g. in terms of data protection or energy consumption, see also the chapter "Good jobs and prosperity for all").
Our vision differs fundamentally from the current economic and political climate.

 Introduction of new and progressive economic indicators and targets to be used for the evaluation of public investments. These indicators and targets take into account the value of natural resources and set incentives against their exploitation.
 Inclusion of quality of life and well-being, such as employment, mental and physical health, leisure time and recreation in the measurement of gross national product.
 
Intensify the efforts of European institutions to coordinate the collection and use of economic data. This should help to create sustainable economic indicators.
 Inclusion of sustainability and quality of life measurements in political decisions. This applies to the application of European budgetary rules, EU budget negotiations and the European Semester process.

1.2 Investing in the industry of the future
 Tripling the budget for "Horizon Europe". This is intended to make the funding of research and innovation programs more effective. The main aim is to support projects that tackle the climate crisis, contribute to achieving the UN's sustainable development goals and increase the EU's competitiveness and growth. Strengthening European research must be a central component of European public investment that benefits all Member States.
 As part of such an investment initiative, we propose
> Increase investment in public goods and services. Health, education, cybersecurity, human-centered artificial intelligence, micro-technology and networks have been neglected for too long. However, these must be available to all EU citizens and promoted through projects with a clear focus on sustainability and green growth.
> Increase funding to support programmes to digitize our public processes and functions (see the chapter "Making Europe's society more inclusive").
> Developing research in critical and underdeveloped areas of sustainability (see the chapters "Prioritizing climate neutrality" and "Climate neutrality"). "Healthy ecosystems").
> 
Creating the basis for a European arms industry to support the development of effective European armed forces (see the chapter on "Foreign policy and defense").
> Building innovative and competitive industrial clusters instead of a geographically concentrated industrial core. With a focused geographic strategy, we make it possible to drive forward profitable European infrastructure projects without the veto rights of individual member states.
> Establishment of a comprehensive European venture capital program. The aim is to provide private and public venture capital and to promote innovative European products and services.
services to the global market. This should be managed by the European Investment Fund.
> Tripling the entire EU budget to 3 trillion over seven years. Our projects must be financially supported. This is to be financed by borrowing and EU taxes (see the chapter "Strengthening the EU").
> Promoting the (further) education of European citizens (see the chapter "Making Europe's society more inclusive").

1.3 Green economy
 Introduction of nationwide CO2 pricing covering all economic sectors. The revenue should flow into green investments (see chapter
"Prioritize climate neutrality").
 Introduction of standardized rules to prohibit planned product wear and tear, promote circular economy and reduce waste of resources.
 
Expansion of semiconductor production in the EU. The EU is to set itself the target of manufacturing 20% of semiconductors in the EU by 2030. This includes electrolytes, inverters, batteries and critical components for solar panels and wind turbines.
 Ensure that raw materials are available. To this end, we want to expand the law on critical raw materials. This should include mandatory licenses for the export of critical resources.

1.4 Shaping digital transformation responsibly
 Continuous research into technologies and the impact of current legislation. This should result in new laws that facilitate the development of digital technologies. The focus should be on preserving European values and creating future industries.
 Ensure the security and protection of users of digital technologies. For example, the security situation of the critical infrastructure should be communicated to the public on an annual basis.
 Promotion of barrier-free and accessible open source technologies. We want to increase access to open source software for EU institutions and industries and ensure that everyone in Europe has access to new technologies. Supportive legislation must be created here.
 Promoting sustainable and durable technologies. For example, we want to Strengthen the "right to repair" so that everyone who can repair their product themselves has access to affordable spare parts and repair information. Similarly, manufacturers should be required to publish the environmental footprint of products in their specifications (including the manufacturer's supply chain).
 
Ensure that current and new technologies do not violate fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we want to introduce mandatory reviews of AI systems to ensure that they do not violate privacy or create discriminatory effects.
 Supporting entrepreneurs in adapting to the EU regulatory framework. In doing so, we want to regulato

1.5 Permanent European investment programs
 Permanent inclusion of the recovery and resilience program in EU budget negotiations. This is the largest EU program to promote economic development as well as social and environmental goals. We are committed to ensuring that this program strengthens the EU's strategic autonomy. In this way, we want to strengthen our economic supply chains and create incentives for critical goods to be produced and stored in the EU (re-shoring).
 Strengthening programs such as "Invest EU". These offer support for small and medium-sized enterprises. This applies in particular to companies with innovative business models or companies that provide critical goods. The investment rules of such programmes should strengthen regions that are affected by brain drain in order to counteract the geographical centralization of the European economy.
 Reforming the rules for the import of goods and services. We want to prevent European taxpayers from paying for the import of goods from outside the European Economic Area. This applies when these are of strategic importance for the
economic autonomy of the EU and would therefore have to be offered in the EU itself. Imports of strategic goods lead to dependencies that counteract our desired goal of increased strategic autonomy.
 Introduction of a "Small Business Act for Europe". This reserves 25% of public contracts at EU and national level for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, legislation and requirements at both levels should not harm such companies. We want to simplify the public procurement process and reporting requirements for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

1.6 Stronger integration of the European single market
 Promoting the integration of the European market. This applies in particular to the financial markets. A truly integrated financial market should enable entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe, for example, to have the same financial opportunities as those in Western Europe.
 Completion of the banking and capital market union. To this end, we want to introduce a Europe-wide deposit guarantee for bank deposits and European government bonds in order to offer banks effective investments and adequate protection. This will support the completion of European banking regulation.
 Development of safe assets. These are covered by government bonds issued by the EU, the repayment of which is secured by European debt and taxes.
 Increasing the accessibility of capital markets for consumers and companies. This affects both debt and equity capital and our small and medium-sized enterprises. At the same time, it will be easier to raise capital via alternative financial instruments such as crowdfunding and peer-to-peer loans.
 
Strengthening corporate governance standards through tax incentives. In this way, we want to reduce the risk of mismanagement, fraud and excessive speculation. To this end, we want to increase the required equity capital for European banks in order to avoid taxpayers having to pay for expensive bank bailouts.

 Introduction of mandatory measures for monitoring and identifying products. This is intended to prevent products from forced labor from entering the market.


1.8 Critical infrastructure protection
 Expansion of the definition of critical infrastructure. This should also include European transport systems, infrastructure for waste disposal and water supply, the healthcare system and public health services, energy supply networks, ports, airports, nuclear power plants, digital communication networks, data centers, network cables, farmland and chemical plants.
 Bringing forward investment in critical pan- European infrastructure projects. This includes a renewed commitment to Trans- European Transport Networks (TEN-T). To this end, we want to double the EU funding instrument "Connecting Europe".
 
Introduction of the right for the EU to prevent foreign direct investment (FDI) in critical infrastructure. This should happen if it comes to the conclusion that an investment poses a security risk to the European economy. This ensures that the EU retains its necessary autonomy. The same

1.9 Payment transactions and financial services - more secure and competitive
 Introduction of measures that offer EU citizens and companies secure and affordable options for payments and digital financial services. The aim is to prevent a few companies that charge high transaction fees from dominating the market.
 Combining competition and good offers for customers. Competition in the market for financial services and the introduction of useful features such as inexpensive card payments or instant bank transfers must be reconciled.
 Initiation of competition proceedings in cases where the market for payment services is dominated by a small number of companies.
 Review of the establishment of a European public company for payment processing. This applies in the event that it should be determined that large American payment processors exploit their dominant market position to charge excessive fees.
 
Introduction of a digital euro as a useful means of payment without having to rely on a bank account. This should also create competitive pressure on the market for deposits and payments. There should be no upper limits on the amount of digital euros held by private individuals and salary payments should be able to be made in these.
 Preservation of cash. Cash should be preserved and protected as the central legal tender in our economy. However, real estate transactions with cash should be limited throughout Europe in order to prevent money laundering.

1.10 Combating tax evasion and avoidance
 Measures to combat tax evasion and avoidance. This is widespread in the EU due to tax competition between member states and often allows large international companies to avoid taxes, while small and medium-sized enterprises have to pay their fair share.
> Harmonization of corporate taxation.
This is to be achieved by using a common corporate tax base (CCCTB) in the EU. The profits of multinational corporations should be distributed among the member states using a precise formula.
> Introduction of an effective minimum corporation tax. This should amount to at least 22%. At the same time, mandatory national surcharge taxes should be levied on corporate profits from low-tax countries in order to effectively achieve at least 22%. In addition, optional national surcharge taxes up to the national tax rate should be made possible.
> Facilitating the automatic and mandatory exchange of information between all EU member states. This is to be achieved with the help of our proposed EU Ministry of Finance as the coordinating institution (see the "Strengthening the EU" section).
 Effective action against tax evasion and illegal money flows. We currently have no overview of where a large proportion of private and corporate assets are located in Europe or abroad.
is located at all. By i m p r o v i n g the exchange of information between national authorities, we can better understand wealth inequality, fight against tax evasion and stop the flow of illegal money from abroad into Europe.
> Introduction of a central asset register. The aim is to merge data from various sources,
e.g. from national tax and land registers. The EU Ministry of Finance should take responsibility for this project in order to close the current knowledge gaps on the distribution of wealth.
> Worldwide exchange of data with other such registers. Suitable mechanisms must be created for this. In particular, this should be carried out with regard to information on offshore tax havens.
European data protection standards must be guaranteed for such exchanges.
> Authorization of the EU Ministry of Finance to negotiate reciprocal exchanges. The Ministry needs the right to negotiate agreements for the reciprocal exchange of such data with the competent authorities in international financial centers.
> Enforcement of EU rules on the registration of beneficial owners. Member states must be obliged to keep national registers so that real estate investors can no longer hide behind anonymous front companies.

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
The measures described in the chapter "Europe's path to sustainable prosperity" require both minor and major changes to the existing legal framework of the European Union.
Some would require additional changes to the treaties. These include, for example, the use of new indicators for the application of the European Union's budgetary rules, which would require an amendment to Articles 121 and 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Protocol 12 of the Treaty. Similarly, some measures to protect critical infrastructure require an amendment to the EU Treaties, as national security is the responsibility of the Member States. In addition, a deposit guarantee financed by the European Union and covered by European debt and taxes is likely to require a treaty amendment.
Other proposed measures require less far- reaching changes to existing legal or administrative instruments. For example the measures to promote green
economy, new legal instruments and amendments to existing or proposed secondary legislation by the Commission are required, including Regulation (EU) 2023/1781 (Chips Act), the Critical Raw Materials Act (not yet adopted) or the Net Zero Industry Act (not yet adopted). Similarly, the measures to complete the banking and capital markets union require the adoption of new secondary legislation in this area without amending the treaties. Furthermore, to facilitate the exchange of information between Member States, the introduction of new secondary legislation is required, possibly amending existing instruments such as Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation. In addition, new investments require the agreement of the Member States to increase the EU budget within the framework of
of the multiannual financial framework. Finally, the proposal "Sustainable European Investment Programs" requires an amendment to Directive 2014/24/EU on public procurement.

2.1 The EU must speak with one voice in the world
 Development of the European External Action Service (EEAS) into a Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the European Union (MAAEU). This reform is intended to make the EU's foreign policy apparatus more efficient, effective and globally influential. Due to its democratic mandate, the newly created Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the European Union is the sole representative for the jointly formulated foreign policy of the EU. The Ministry is to perform key tasks in the area of political (international cooperation, human rights, neighborhood and enlargement, humanitarian aid) and scientific diplomacy (climate and global health, development of an EU space strategy and civil exploration of Mars, the moon, etc.).
 Division of the role of the High Representation of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy into two separate positions. One is responsible for European foreign policy and the other for European defense. This division of tasks is intended to enable specialization and focused leadership in their respective areas of responsibility.
 Promotion of a common diplomatic culture. This is to take place at both national and ministerial level. The number of EU staff is to be increased in proportion to the number of seconded national staff.
At the same time, participation in the European Diplomatic Academy and its training programs will be mandatory for all EU diplomatic staff (both national and ministerial).
 Improvement of consular services. The ministry is to manage the bilateral representation and consular services for all EU member states in third countries without a national diplomatic presence in these member states.
 Establishment of an appropriate joint intelligence analysis unit. The EU Intelligence and Situation Center will be empowered to collect and process information gathered by Member States and ministerial delegations. The intelligence service will also establish its own intelligence gathering capabilities under effective parliamentary and judicial scrutiny to ensure respect for human rights. EU intelligence analysis will inform the decision-making processes of common EU foreign and security policy, including the identification of common security threats and priorities.

2.2 A progressive foreign policy
 Promote a strong awareness of the colonial and imperialist legacies of member states in third countries in the European diplomatic corps. This should be reflected in EU diplomacy towards these third countries by creating a diverse and united diplomatic representation with a European voice.
 Highlighting different historical contexts in Europe. This should help to establish a structured dialog with third countries and be based o n equality and respect. The aim is to move away from past paternalistic and exploitative legacies and counteract resentment.
 
Integration of a feminist foreign policy within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the European Union. Internally, this requires ensuring equal participation of women* and other disadvantaged groups in the EU diplomatic service, including in leadership positions. Externally, the EU will promote equal participation in negotiations and peace agreements with other international actors. EU delegations to international negotiations will be composed according to the principles of feminist foreign policy.

2.3 The vision of a bigger, stronger and more inclusive Union
 Introduction of a new enlargement methodology based on gradual and phased integration into the EU. This replaces the current "all or nothing" approach with an efficient, transparent and fair process. As accession countries make progress in implementing reforms to align with EU law, they will gradually gain more access to EU resources such as the EU budget and participation in EU institutions. These stages can be reversed if the reforms take a step backwards. The then European government (formerly the Commission) will monitor this process. Candidate countries must be able to fully understand the process and the assessment of their progress and have the means to review decisions. The new system will accelerate candidate entry times through new incentives for reform, counteracting "enlargement fatigue" while improving the flexibility of the EU's "absorption capacity".
 Adaptation of EU enlargement to other non- European organizations. The new staged enlargement should be complemented by membership of other framework organizations such as the European Political Community (EPC) and the Council of Europe. Membership of such organizations should not be an alter- native to EU membership for future candidates, but should be differentiated in terms of different priorities and the
complement the scope of the commitment. The
EU enlargement should be based on a performance-based
open-door policy.
 Providing special support for nations confronted with foreign aggression. To this end, a
clearly prepared range of options will be developed. Countries aspiring to EU membership and under threat will be provided with appropriate instruments to protect their sovereignty, territorial integrity and societal resilience on their path to EU accession. In addition, the EU is to fulfill special long-term political, financial and military commitments to protect Ukraine and secure its path towards EU accession.
Financial resources that are confiscated as part of sanctions against Russia are to be used for such aid, accession reforms and reconstruction.
 Reform of the EU in preparation for enlargement. In particular, decision-making procedures that currently require unanimity in the Council must be replaced by qualified majority voting (QMV) in order to avoid blockades caused by the individual veto of member states. In addition, the EU budget must be reformed in order to meet the financial needs of an enlarged EU (see chapter "Reforming the EU").

2.4 A smaller global North-South divide in the economy
 Establishment of a "European Development Aid Agency" to pool national development aid efforts. According to the OECD figures for 2022, the 27 member states and institutions of the European Union together contribute 115 billion US dollars to development aid, twice as much as the sum of American aid. In order to increase effectiveness and visibility, Volt proposes that funding and mechanisms for official development assistance be pooled at European level within the framework of a "European Development Agency". Specific financial, personnel and institutional regulations should be created for this purpose. This transfer would provide the EU with unique opportunities to contribute to the implementation of sustainable development goals and to strengthen its capabilities in the area of foreign policy. strengthen "soft power".
 Development and promotion of a "Strasbourg Consensus" on development aid. This is linked to the further development of similar models from the USA and China. In the "Washington Consensus", the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) linked loans to the opening of national economies, with sometimes catastrophic effects. For their part, China and its allies have developed a "Beijing Consensus". This promises to finance infrastructure. However, little consideration is given to the countries' indebtedness, principles of governance and human rights.
The EU can develop and promote an independent consensus that reshapes international cooperation in the field of development aid. It should be based on the following principles:
> Reorganization of the debt of the least developed countries within the framework of the Paris Club (60 countries are affected by over- indebtedness).
> Introduction of a new clause in loan agreements for developing countries that automatically suspends repayments in the event of a severe natural disaster.
> Revision of the regulations of international institutions. The recruitment of World Bank and IMF executives should be based on their skills. Representatives of civil society and NGOs should be involved in the committees of these institutions.
> Credit conditions that are linked to the fight against corruption, respect for the rights of minorities and guidelines for the promotion and protection of women*.

 Development of the EDA (European Defence Agency) and the defense-industrial elements of the European Commission (e.g. DG DEFIS) into a European Ministry of Defense (EUMD). This is intended to create a centralized institution for European defence matters. This includes strategies, operations, research, procurement of the technical and industrial base.
 Establishment of a European Military Headquarters (EMHQ), which is responsible for developing strategies and making decisions on operations.
of the EU military units. This EMHQ reports to the EUMD and should be supported by a European Military Academy (EMA), which trains and educates a new generation of military personnel with a common military culture and creates a common military culture.
 Strengthening regional specialization in certain areas (e.g. air, land, sea) and capabilities (e.g. cyber, amphibious, airborne operations). In the short term, this will promote the joint development o f defense capabilities and increase the cost efficiency and interaction of national EU forces. At the same time, best practices in the regional integration of national units will be promoted and standardized at the operational level. Examples include Franco- German and German-Dutch units. This is intended to
contribute to the development of a common military culture and operational effectiveness.
 Development of joint EU defense capabilities. In the medium term, the aim is to ensure that the Rapid Deployment Capacity (RDC) is operational by 2025. This should be further expanded, provided with EU personnel and standardized equipment and given extended mission objectives. In addition, the EU should establish a standing European Intervention Force (ERF) with a personnel strength of 60,000 soldiers. It will be equipped with a wide range of land, air, sea and space resources. Its main purpose is to be the first response force to threats to the territorial integrity of the EU and to complement national armed forces. This capability is the EU's first priority. It can also be made available to NATO. The EMA will train the personnel of the RDC and ERF.
 Establishment of transnational military units under EU leadership. To this end, an agreement accessible to all EU members will be created, which will form a steering body with the necessary powers. This body can set up integrated

This represents a rapid first step towards the long-term EU-wide integration of the armed forces. At the same time, the development of an autonomous EU defense capability is urgently needed, at least to the extent that the member states are prepared to do so.
 Expansion of the "European Solidarity Corps" into a single voluntary EU civil and military service program. This is funded by the EU and complements existing national military and/or civilian services.
 Promotion of grassroots initiatives and associations for digital and civil resilience. These work to strengthen and fund digital and civil resilience against hybrid threats. These initiatives are intended to counteract activities such as election influence campaigns carried out by "troll factories" from third countries.
 Establishment of a European civil and military department for disaster relief operations. This is to expand the scope and powers of RescEU along the lines of the Spanish Unidad Militar de Emergencias and the German Technisches Hilfswerk. This department will intervene in all types of disasters and catastrophes. We need to create more competencies in our society to adapt to the climate crisis and future conflicts.

2.6 More strategic autonomy for the EU defense industry
 Authorization of the EU Ministry of Defence t o identify military requirements and to ensure research, development and provision of these capabilities through tenders.
This will equip the European armed forces with state-of-the-art military capabilities. As long as this main objective is achieved, procurement should promote development in economically underdeveloped regions of the EU.
 Strengthening the EU's position as a global innovator in the defense sector. The EU should become a driving force for the development of emerging and ground- breaking strategic defense technologies. Existing efforts such as the EU Defense Innovation Scheme (EUDIS) and the Hub for EU Defense Innovation (HEDI) should be safeguarded and their mandates and funding increased. This initiative should focus on capability areas where the EU can achieve global competitiveness, such as the development of cyber-,
AI, carbon neutrality (e.g. green hydrogen), quantum computing and space defense technologies.
 Consolidation of the European Defense Fund (EDF). The aim is to bring together existing separate EU funding instruments in connection with joint defense initiatives, including research, development and procurement. The EDF will become a permanent part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) in the next budget cycle
and will comprise at least 6% of the EU budget. In addition, a new target will be established that requires at least 60% of all defense spending by member states to be made available for joint projects.
 Integration of the EU defense industry into the internal market. National industrial protectionism is to be dismantled in order to create significant economies of scale. This will be replaced by the creation of EU regional defense industry hubs (industry, education, etc.) around leading countries. SMEs and companies in neighboring Member States should be involved in this.
 Develop precise common rules on arms exports and ensure strict and consistent enforcement for EU defense companies operating outside the EU.

2.7 Europe as a strong pillar for NATO and the democratic states
 Establishment of an EU-NATO Strategy Coordination Group. By this we mean a political steering body that
structured, long-term cooperation between the two associations. The committee will develop a joint strategic document defining common priorities, threat perceptions, capacity requirements, availability of forces and areas of specialization (such as territorial defense vs. hybrid resilience). It should also delineate regional and thematic roles, particularly with regard to the distribution of roles in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, emerging and groundbreaking technologies that could be decisive for defense should be included.
 Continuation of the task force on the resilience of critical infrastructures. Here, concrete measures are to be taken to ensure the effectiveness and resilience of critical infrastructures in the Euro-Atlantic military supply chain network. This includes undersea communication cables and infrastructures that are crucial for energy supply and military mobility. EU and NATO candidate countries should also be included.
 Increase interdependence to minimize the risk of transatlantic political tensions. This should
be promoted through joint integration in non-military initiatives. This would relate in particular to market integration, setting regulatory standards and minimizing strategic dependencies in relation to emerging technologies (AI, quantum computing), critical value chains for rare earth minerals and semiconductors. We want to illustrate such efforts using the example of the
EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) and the sustainable Club for Steel and Aluminium (GSA). These efforts should help to create a transatlantic "Brussels effect".
 Develop a broader strategy for deeper cooperation with other countries that share political norms, values and interests with the EU and NATO. This includes candidate countries of both organizations, key non- NATO allies and regional organizations. This voluntary cooperation should include efforts to increase mutual deterrence, societal resilience and political cooperation in order to strengthen the unity of democracies.
 The Summit for Democracy should be institutionalized as a forum for coordination. This forum should pursue clear membership criteria and an open- door policy.

2.8 Ensuring comprehensive strategic deterrence
 Promote the global ban on nuclear weapons and support the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) as a long-term strategy for the global disarmament of nuclear weapons. This is subject to the condition that it is compatible with the fundamental need for a credible strategic deterrent in the event of persistent threats.
 Reduce the global stockpile of nuclear weapons, both in terms of operational warheads and those decommissioned or in storage. This would alleviate the problem of verifiability, reduce the risk of human error in the event of a (large-scale) nuclear attack and improve the effectiveness of monitoring, while at the same time reducing the risk of circumvention.
 Transfer of control of the French nuclear deterrent potential to the European government. This is to take place following the adoption of a European constitution and the establishment of fully democratic and accountable federal institutions. Over time, the personnel, systems and procedures will be fully integrated into European structures.
 Development of a strategic defense system capable of effectively countering airborne threats to the
EU territory. This includes the ability to respond to limited (ballistic) nuclear attacks.
 Establishment of a conventional strike force. This should offer a broader range of options along the escalation ladder and minimize dependence on nuclear deterrence wherever possible.
 Pursuing a holistic approach to governance. The aim is to ensure the EU's resilience in times of peace, conflict and war as well as in the "gray zone" in between. Current EU policy is mainly focused on promoting resilience as a framework to combat different threats. Although this framework is effective, the EU needs to develop specific policies and measures to implement this framework effectively.
 Integration of existing instruments (Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, EU Hybrid Threats Framework) to create a doctrine for different types of threats. This doctrine will build on the Council of Europe's "Helsinki Approach" to establish a uniform classification for different types of threats. The first implementation of this framework will be cyber resilience under the Cyber Solidarity Act.

 Strengthening the EU Intelligence Analysis Centre (EUINTCEN) to manage and implement defense. At the same time, a legal framework for the exchange of intelligence information between Member States will be created. The EUINTCEN will thus facilitate rapid and effective countermeasures and develop recommendations to improve joint civil- military planning for various scenarios. The first phase of capability development will focus on cyber resilience in the context of the
"Cyber Solidarity Act". The development of the capability will also aim to facilitate the processes of further development in the public-private sector in critical infrastructures.
 Definition of a threshold for threats where the mutual defense clause (Art. 42(7) TEU) can be invoked. At the same time, appropriate means of defense are to be proposed and defined. In addition, the relevant bodies
clarify the division of labor in allocating and combating hybrid threats between the Integrated Political Crisis Res- ponse (IPCR) arrangements, the Hybrid Fusion Cell within the EUINTCEN and the EUMFA (DG DEFIS,

 Adoption of a comprehensive pan- demic agreement to implement a robust framework for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.

 Restructuring of the global financial system to promote inclusivity and fairness in the global financial system. This applies in particular to the effective

 Introduction of new own resources for the UN, creation of financial mechanisms such as a Global Resources Dividend (GRD) or a Tobin tax. In this way, we want to finance transitions in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and distribute the financial burden of the United Nations more fairly.
 Convocation of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA). This is intended to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the UN and set a precedent for the
representative democracy at UN level, which could be further expanded in terms of its mandate and scope in the future. This includes abolishing vetoes by permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The UNPA should introduce a representative electoral system that takes into account the population size of the member states.
 Reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC). In the short term, we want to add more permanent members to the UNSC and convert the French permanent UNSC seat into an EU seat. In the long term, we want to abolish the permanent seats and introduce regular elections for UNSC seats by the General Assembly (later the UNPA). These elections would draw from a pool of candidates from regional groups. The UNSC should increase the total number of seats to better reflect regional, economic and population diversity. This includes the allocation of seats to regional organizations. In addition, the majority voting principle should replace unanimity on matters related to genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. This includes decisions that legitimize military interventions.

A STRONGER EU: THE GEOPOLITICAL IMPORTANCE OF EUROPE
How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
The Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is based, among other things, on Articles 21-46 of the EU Treaty and Articles 205-222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In the area of CFSP, the EU currently has special legislative competences, which include specific institutional features such as the limited participation of the European Parliament in the decision-making process. The CFSP is currently defined and implemented by the European Council and the Council of the European Union.
In order to implement the measures of the Act, it is legally necessary to amend treaties. These changes include the establishment of common legislative competences to enable the Union to introduce common standards through legislation. Policy measures, such as "One voice for the EU in the world", require a comprehensive review of the existing legal framework. This includes restructuring the European External Action Service (EEAS) into a European Union Ministry for Foreign Affairs (EUMFA) and splitting the role of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) into two positions, namely an EU Minister for Foreign Affairs and an EU Minister for Defense. To implement this policy, we propose amendments to the Treaties
before. We want to amend Title III of the EU Treaty "Provisions relating to the institutions",
Title V of the EU Treaty "General provisions on the Union's external action and specific provisions on the common foreign and security policy", Title V of the
TFEU on "International Agreements" and the Declaration on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
In addition, subsequent legislation is required to create and further define ministerial
o f f i c e s .	Volt s e e k s to strengthen the EU's strategic autonomy in the defense industry by enhancing the EU's position as a global defense innovator. To consolidate and improve entities such as the EU Defense Innovation Scheme (EUDIS) and the Hub for EU Defense Innovation (HEDI), there is a need for amendments and updates to existing secondary legislation, such as EU Regulation 2021/697 on the European Defense Fund.
They also require
political efforts to strengthen and renew the role of the Union in the global context, the advocacy of principles
such as feminist foreign policy within the existing framework of NATO and the United Nations as well as in new bilateral and multilateral agreements.

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) enshrines the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality. All European laws should be based on these principles and promote their implementation in the lives of all EU citizens and people living in the European Union.
The chapter "Making Europe's society more inclusive" deals with topics such as health, inclusion, education, digitalization and social equality. The European Union cannot legally regulate many of these areas, as the legislative powers lie with the member states. In order to implement the positive changes called for in this chapter, Volt proposes an amendment to the Treaty to divide responsibilities for public and human health and education. This would allow the European Union to introduce common standards. In order to achieve these ambitious goals, new European laws are required, which Volt will introduce in the European Parliament. These should create clear regulations and transparency. Combining and updating existing anti-discrimination directives and working on an "EU anti-discrimination law" that includes the rights of people from the LGBTQIA+ community and protects the rights of all people in the European Union.
Union are necessary steps to promote equality. People with disabilities need adequate legal protection, including by proposing a directive to remove barriers to inclusion that implements a Europe-wide plan to ensure independent living for people with a mental illness or developmental disability. Volt will work to introduce a law that regulates sex work in all member states, decriminalizes workers and provides them with adequate protection. To reflect changes such as digitalization and working from home, Directive 2019/1152 on transparent working conditions needs to be amended.
Adapting to a digitized world will be achieved by working on a new European eGovernment Action Plan that includes guidelines and measures to redesign government processes, transition to paperless processes, adapt harmonized ICT standards and multi-device friendly services. In addition, Volt is committed to ensuring that the development of the Interoperable Europe Act (2022/0379 (COD)) takes an inclusive approach to stakeholder participation and advocates that the final regulation represents our principles, digital rights, open data and Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS).

4. Good jobs and prosperity for all
Average incomes in Europe have grown in recent decades. However, this has not happened fast enough and has not benefited everyone. The increase in productivity has also slowed and has not benefited everyone equally. As a result, there are significant inequalities within the EU, both locally and between member states. Such a two-tier market means that some workers have secure and stable jobs, while others with fewer rights have to remain in insecure and precarious employment.
Some regions with great potential for sustainable growth experienced a significant shortage of skilled workers and the associated disadvantages for young people on the labor market.
At the same time, women* continue to be underrepresented in well-paid jobs and bear the greater burden of unpaid domestic and care work.
There are many vacancies that remain unfilled due to poor working conditions, with labor rights and protections unevenly enforced across member states. These inequalities affect the well-being of workers and hinder the creation of social cohesion across borders.
The clear lack of sufficient mechanisms for social cohesion at European level further exacerbates the situation and slows down the cooperation needed to overcome common challenges. As a result, poverty remains at an alarmingly high level.
By creating a productive, fair and meaningful working environment for all citizens, we can achieve the emergence of a European social union that supports all Europeans and guarantees their rights. The use of technologies such as automation, AI and green technologies will increase labor productivity, leading to new types of jobs, higher wages and reduced working hours. If we ensure that EU citizens have the skills and education required for these technologies, their use will reduce the burden on workers. Remote work can unleash the full potential of the European labor market. At the same time, robust labour rights ensure fair wages and working conditions for all workers by harmonizing standards across the European Union.
Finally, we propose ending tax competition between Member States and facilitating the harmonization of taxation by defining a common minimum tax base for direct taxation in the EU.

4.1 A genuine European social union
 Development towards a genuine European social union. This is to be achieved in the course of establishing a new EU Ministry of Finance (see the chapters "Europe's path to sustainable prosperity" and "Strengthening the
EU") as the coordinating institution, which will manage an EU budget that is three times larger. This enlarged budget aims to make strategic investments, address social inequalities and protect against economic downturns. Our proposals are:
> A European Basic Income (EBI). This is based on a negative income tax, where people below a certain income threshold receive payments instead of paying taxes.
This creates a safety net and promotes employment, which helps people to escape poverty traps. The EU Ministry of Finance is to finance this from the EU budget so that all EU citizens, adjusted to the purchasing power of the respective region, have access to an income of at least
500 per month. This income would help many EU citizens to cover their basic living costs. With the European Basic Income, we can take a big step towards a truly united European Union. The legal basis for the European Basic Income has already been established for all member states by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union on state aid is binding.
> Creation of incentives for member states to reduce the number of tax exemptions and to apply lower income tax rates and reduce the number of taxes.
This should simplify the tax system and at the same time ensure that citizens can lead a dignified life with the European Basic Income.
> Enforcement of regional minimum wage standards. This should be done in coordination with the member states or a high degree of trade union coverage to ensure that the European Basic Income cannot be exploited.
> Harmonization of taxation procedures between member states so that people have fewer obstacles to working and living in different European countries.
> Creation of a common EU tax base for direct taxes. In doing so, we want to introduce EU-wide minimum effective rates for gift, inheritance and wealth taxation using the European Central Wealth Register (see chapter

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
The European economy should not exist as an end in itself, but should guarantee prosperity and economic security for all citizens of the European Union. The legal framework of the European Union must better reflect this goal of shared prosperity and economic security. To achieve this, we need legislative changes and new laws.
This chapter describes ambitions for a European basic income, an EU tax reform, a European minimum wage and collective bargaining as well as a European social union. The introduction of a European basic income requires far-reaching changes, as the EU currently has no direct competence for social security. Article 153 TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) allows the European Parliament to adopt supporting measures to ensure basic social rights. A new protocol could give the EU the competence to develop and finance such a basic income. A harmonized EU tax base for gift and inheritance taxes as well as wealth taxes can
be achieved through the adoption of directives similar to the VAT Directives.
The introduction of EU taxes requires, among other things, an amendment to Article 311 TFEU, which deals with the system of own resources of the EU.

We therefore support Parliament's call to open up the EU treaties to a convention consisting of representatives of the national parliaments, the heads of state or government of the member states, the European Parliament and the Commission to examine the proposal for a treaty amendment. In doing so, we will ensure that the European Union is given responsibility for tax collection and borrowing.

5. Asylum seekers and refugees
Due to delayed decisions, inhumane reception conditions, mass detentions and the and exclusion at the EU borders, asylum seekers and refugees must
live in Europe under difficult conditions. The distribution of asylum seekers among the member states is still controversial and leaves people in need of protection in a legal limbo.
The current system is dysfunctional and forces asylum seekers to t a k e unsafe, illegal routes. Violations of EU law by European border control authorities and limited search and rescue operations exacerbate the disorganization. As a result, the questionable agreements between EU member states and autocratic
regimes at their borders are not a viable solution and contribute to unnecessary deaths.
The need for change is becoming even more urgent as unprecedented numbers of people worldwide are displaced by various factors such as wars, persecution and environmental disasters. However, most refugees seek refuge in neighboring countries, not in Europe. Volt recognizes that although refugees in the EU make up only a small fraction of the total population, they contribute to the multicultural and diverse fabric of European societies. To overcome these challenges, Europe needs an efficient, fair and humane system. The Asylum and Refugee Act offers concrete solutions to the challenges of integrating asylum s e e k e r s and refugees. It establishes uniform, swift and fair asylum procedures and reception conditions that ensure humane treatment on an equal footing.
In order to reduce the disproportionate burden on border states and ensure that people are placed in an environment where they can rebuild their lives, this chapter proposes a fair redistribution system. This starts on arrival: Asylum seekers are distributed evenly according to objective criteria, taking into account personal preferences. Priority is given to immediate access to social, legal, medical and psychological assistance. As a result, the law promotes the immediate integration and empowerment of refugees and asylum seekers and recognizes their potential to contribute to society.
We also emphasize the protection of the human rights of vulnerable people. Safe, regular routes should be created for refugees and violations of their rights should be monitored. Human rights are safeguarded through the legal recognition of climate refugees. This represents a forward-looking approach t o overcoming the challenges of climate-induced displacement. The establishment of additional regular channels for labor migration, as set out in the Labor Migration Act, will reduce the influx of asylum seekers to Europe. This law improves the conditions for asylum seekers within the EU. It also addresses problems beyond the borders of the EU. The focus here is on the causes of flight and improving reception conditions in the region.

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
The right to asylum, enshrined in Article 18 of the EU Charter, is a fundamental right that Volt wants to secure and strengthen in further legislation. This includes a revision of the new Pact on Migration and Asylum, which was proposed in September 2020. The pact was accompanied by several legislative proposals, including the Qualification Regulation 2016/0223 (COD), the Asylum Procedures Regulation 2016/0224 (COD), the Reception Conditions Directive 2016/0222 (COD) and the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation 2020/0279(COD) (AMMR), which was recently adopted by the Council.
Volt aims to provide the Union with powers to legislate on harmonized integration policy on the occasion of an upcoming treaty change. We want to propose further updates to EU legislation. In addition, the so-called solidarity mechanism as set out in the AMMR, which currently facilitates relocation, needs to be amended,
to ensure fair and efficient resettlement. This amendment must take into account the personal connections of the refugees as well as the key indicators of the Member States such as
e.g. take GDP into account. Volt also calls for the proposed Asylum Procedures Regulation 2016/0224 (COD) to be amended to further
harmonization of asylum procedures and consideration for humane and lean procedures at the borders. The proposed Qualification Regulation 2016/0223 (COD) and the Reception Conditions Directive 2016/0222 (COD) must meet the standards
in the Member States. This includes a uniform approach to granting asylum and adequate reception conditions. In addition, the regulations should emphasize that the detention of asylum seekers can only be a last resort and ensure that minors may not be detained. Volt also wants to support the revision of Directive 2011/36/EU on combating trafficking in human beings and call on all member states to promote the early detection of trafficking in human beings. improve the identification and referral of victims to support organizations. This applies in particular in connection with the asylum procedure. Refugees and persons enjoying subsidiary protection have the same right to family reunification in accordance with Directive 2003/86/EC. The status of climate refugees should be recognized. Volt will advocate for international and EU treaties as well as secondary rights such as the Qualification Directive for the recognition of refugee status.

6. Labor migration
Europe's demographic challenge, made tangible by an ageing population and an acute shortage of skilled workers, can also offer an opportunity for innovation and growth. Facing up to the problem opens up opportunities that can improve Europe's long-term competitiveness and economic resilience. It is therefore necessary to attract international skilled workers without weakening the rights of non-EU workers. This balance is crucial to prevent labor exploitation and create an attractive environment for third-country nationals at all wage levels.
Workers in the low and middle-income sector are often exposed to precarious conditions. Especially without EU status, they run the risk of being exploited, as their employment is tied to very specific employers. In contrast, highly skilled migrant workers face bureaucratic hurdles that limit their flexibility within the European labor market and ensure that many skilled workers emigrate to more attractive countries such as Canada, the USA and Australia instead.
The fragmentation of labor markets within the EU member states poses a challenge to the competitiveness of the entire European Union. A common European approach to labor migration would stimulate the labor market and promote growth. To achieve this, migration must be managed effectively, skills shortages must be compensated for and critical sectors must be supported. This also promotes innovation in the long term. Increased mobility of nationals from non-European third countries would enable them to counteract critical developments in the respective labor market not only in a single country, but throughout the EU. This would benefit both the European economy and local communities.
Volt is committed to establishing an efficient migration system. This should respect the rights of migrants, improve their integration into the EU labor market, promote our global competitiveness and strengthen prosperity and social cohesion within the European Union.
To this end, we are campaigning for a uniform European legal framework. This should decouple residence permits from specific employers and ensure the right to family reunification and access to social benefits.
These changes empower migrants and create a fair and equal European labor market.
We are also committed to creating safe and regular migration routes. In this way, we want to eliminate labor shortages and skills gaps in a targeted manner and thus make the EU labor market more dynamic, more responsive and therefore more future-proof.
At the same time, the advantages of freedom of movement within Europe must be recognized. This leads to a simplification of processes, efficient labor markets and thus better integration of migrants. This approach makes the European Union as a whole more attractive, more competitive and promotes the development and prosperity of all member states.

 Recruit international skilled workers with a "Make it in Europe" program to fill vacancies from European employers with international skilled workers of all wage and qualification levels.
 Establishment of an EU skilled labor force matching platform (EU talent pool) for migrant workers, the regional
market differences within the EU and facilitates the recognition of foreign qualifications and skills at EU level.
 Simplifying the recognition of qualifications and skills that were not acquired in the EU in order to open up new perspectives for international students, researchers and other professionals.
 Acceleration of visa procedures, so that they last a maximum of three months.
 Creating regulated opportunities to meet the current unmet demand in low and middle-wage sectors. This includes new offers such as visas for job seekers and
trainees or programs specifically designed to promote the flexibility of young people in the European labor market.
 Freedom of movement for migrant workers with visas within the EU.
 Possibility for immigrants within the EU to apply for a residence permit. This should be possible regardless of their status or the absence of a residence permit.
 Strengthen the right to family reunification for all migrants by improving the Family Reunification Directive.
 Improved access to the social system for migrants. This includes the right to healthcare, social security, housing, justice and gender equality.
 Add English as an official language. Migrant workers, whether from outside or inside the EU, should have access to translation services when dealing with government bureaucracy so that the language barrier is no longer an obstacle.

 Protect migrant workers from labor exploitation. To this end, residence permits should no longer be linked to individual employers and specific jobs. Their duration of stay should be extended. This applies in particular to the protection of people in seasonal and temporary employment, as the loss of employment should not automatically lead to the loss of residence status.
 Strengthen Commission guidelines to encourage victims of labor exploitation to report their experiences to a monitoring authority without the risk of deportation.
 
Establish a "firewall" between labor jurisdiction and immigration enforcement. This should enable migrant workers to safely lodge a complaint against abusive employers without fear of losing their residence status or, in the case of undocumented migrants, being arrested and deported. The European Labor Office can play an important role in coordinating this.

This is the only way to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, from geopolitical tensions and international competition to the climate crisis and growing inequalities.
 Develop new framework conditions to attract skilled workers who contribute to innovation, growth and competitiveness. Fair and transparent conditions must be guaranteed for all employees, regardless of their origin.
 Strengthening social cohesion and improving integration by promoting cultural diversity, mutual respect and civic participation.
 Introduction of an EU Blue Card system to simplify and harmonize admission criteria. The procedure for
highly qualified workers must be simplified and harmonized:
> Application: Unbureaucratic, fast and simplified online procedure with a standardized EU-wide application process (maximum processing time of 14 days).
> 
Renewal: Simplified online procedure for renewal with a longer validity period.
> Mobility: Flexible and standardized EU-wide mobility program for highly
qualified migrants who want to take up a job in another EU country in order to keep these highly qualified workers in the EU.
> Naturalization: Free, simple and fast naturalization procedure for migrant workers who have spent 3 years in the EU and contributed to the EU economy (maximum 2 months processing time).
 Establish an EU Skills Pool to match highly skilled workers with jobs across the EU. This will be done through an online platform that allows workers to register their profile, skills, qualifications and preferences and allows employers to access the pool and offer jobs to suitable candidates.
 Introduction of an EU framework for the recognition of qualifications. This is intended to facilitate the unbureaucratic recognition of foreign qualifications and competences throughout the EU and

7. Strengthening the EU
For over 70 years now, after two devastating world wars, Europe has shown how we can stand together, across borders and with humanity, against division and destruction and achieve peace and prosperity. But the EU must continue to develop, because it could do so much more! At a time when populism is on the rise, we absolutely must shape our EU in such a way that it works for us all.
An "ever more united union of the peoples of Europe" cannot be achieved if we do not take ambitious steps towards a federal Europe.
The European Union is just as important today as it was when it was founded after the Second World War and is increasingly becoming a geopolitical necessity. Issues such as the climate crisis, migration, global economic competition and the disregard for the rules-based international order cannot be resolved by small, individual actors.
can only be tackled by the Member States themselves, but require joint action. Even within the EU, the current structure allows each individual member state t o t a k e important decisions.
block legislation, sanctions packages or trade agreements that can be of fundamental importance to millions of European citizens. To achieve tangible benefits and better help its citizens, the EU must be reformed.
The "Strengthening the EU" chapter aims to demonstrate the EU's ability to act collectively. Volt wants to ensure that member states work together effectively to overcome common challenges. Strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the EU is of central importance here. The current institutional framework prioritizes the interests of member states over those of citizens, leading to decision-making processes that are inefficient and heavily influenced by national interests. This limits the EU's ability to act quickly, purposefully and in the interests of its citizens.
In view of the forthcoming EU enlargement, the old decision-making processes also need to be reformed. This will make the countless interlinked challenges we face visible. Additional votes in the Council after enlargement will intensify the debate. This comes with the risk of regular deadlock. Furthermore, the European Parliament, the only EU institution directly elected by citizens, is still not entitled to propose legislation and must wait for other institutions to take action.

 The role of the European Parliament must change from merely co-deciding on laws to participating in the initiation of new laws - a power that would be shared with the Senate, EU citizens via the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI), and the European government.
 New laws are proposed by a parliamentary group or an equivalent minimum number of individual MPs that would be required to form a parliamentary group.

7.6 Fiscal and monetary union
 Tripling the EU budget. We call for a fundamental reform of the European Union's finances by tripling the EU budget in order to enable public investment, eliminate social imbalances and
stabilize the economy during economic downturns.
 Levying European taxes. A democratic Europe should be able to levy taxes to finance the EU budget, in particular taxes on climate-damaging consumption and large fortunes. This should be flanked by clear and binding budget rules
for the member states, but which allow more flexibility than the current interpretation of the Maastricht criteria.
 The EU should be allowed to borrow for investments in economic development projects that benefit the whole of Europe. The creation of such European government bonds will strengthen the stability of the integrated financial market as a safe asset. At the same time, this new fiscal and monetary union should provide more effective institutionalized instruments to ensure that member states maintain a structurally balanced budget.
 
Creation of budgetary policy instruments that automatically increase European government spending during economic downturns and provide more financial flexibility in the event of an impending recession.
 Encouraging Member States that have not yet adopted the euro to do so in order to promote economic cohesion and stability in Europe.
 Expansion of the mandate of the European Central Bank (ECB) to a "dual mandate" aimed at both price stability and full employment, so that European economic performance is based on both financial stability and inclusive growth.
 Establishment of an EU Ministry of Finance to act as a central regulatory authority that sets standards for national tax and regulatory authorities.

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
To strengthen the collective action of the EU, Volt wants to set up a European Convention on a Federal Europe. This convention would transform the two EU treaties into a European constitution and modernize the legal framework by planning a reform of the role of the institutions of the European Union. The Council of the European Union should be transformed into a European Senate, which would act as a
second chamber of the EU. This requires an amendment to the Treaty with regard to the procedure for creating the Council in Article 15 TEU. In addition, the legislative powers of the European Parliament should be extended by giving it legislative competence. This requires an amendment to Article 17 TEU, which currently only allows the Commission to take such an initiative. This should apply unless otherwise stipulated in the treaties.
Volt aims to make the EU's decision-making process more effective by replacing unanimity for Council decisions with qualified majority voting in accordance with
Article 7 TEU replaced. Volt would also like to through the abolition of the veto right of the
Member States should strengthen the fundamental values and principles of the Union in Article 2 TEU, such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, in Council decisions. With regard to the Union's legal system, Volt advocates the binding nature of the enforcement of Article 6 TEU for the judgments of the European Convention on Human Rights for the EU and thus also for the Member States. This is essential for the equal protection of human rights standards in the Community. In addition, a truly uniform tax system requires that European taxes can be levied. The ability to levy direct taxes requires new EU laws that extend and supplement existing standards and allow taxation at European level. In order to
To exploit the potential of indirect taxes, such as digital or carbon taxes, a new protocol can be drawn up based on the consent of the Member States. The implementation of binding budgetary rules that keep public debt in check requires, among other things, a reform of Article 121 TFEU.

8. European democracy
The EU must become more democratic in order to become fairer and be able to overcome the current challenges. The current European Union prioritizes national interests over the interests of 500 million citizens. Such a system creates fundamental problems and widens the gap between citizens and the institutions that govern them. The result is a misalignment and a democratic deficit that undermines public confidence in the European project.
Political dissatisfaction is exacerbated by a lack of transparency. This obscures decision- making in the EU. The European Council has become one of the most powerful political bodies. However, it is also the least transparent body, as backroom deals are made without scrutiny that affect the fate of millions of European citizens. This has contributed to growing disappointment among Europeans. Because they are excluded from the processes that determine their lives.
The European Democracy Act aims to create a clear link between European citizens and EU decision-making processes, address systemic shortcomings and bridge the gap between citizens and their institutions. Citizens will be able to understand and influence the decisions that shape their lives. We will improve the transparency of EU processes by creating accountability within the EU apparatus and promoting citizen participation in the decision- making process.
Crucially, this law envisions a Europe in which the interests and voices of individuals are at the center and the limitations of national politics are overcome. By redesigning electoral and parliamentary systems, the aim is to create a European democracy that is honest, representative, accountable and responsive to the needs of all individuals.
This requires a robust European media landscape that promotes transparency and informed citizens. This legislative package therefore promotes the independence, diversity and integrity of the media and takes measures to combat rampant disinformation in the digital age.

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
Our legislative package addresses democratic rules for European political parties as well as lobbying regulations, increased citizen participation in political decision-making processes, combating corruption and preventing democratic backsliding by member states, strengthening the protection of journalists and combating disinformation and the illegal disclosure of data. The proposed measures require the adaptation of primary EU legislation. On the basis of the amendment to Article 11 TEU, Volt wants to promote and facilitate citizen participation by reforming the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI). In addition, the procedure under Article 7 TEU, certain rights are an essential part of European democratic laws. For example, the Council can decide to suspend the voting rights of a Member State if it violates EU values. In the case of serious and persistent violations, an accelerated infringement procedure against the violating member state is necessary. This explicitly includes an extension of the aforementioned provision. The existing Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament (Chapter 4, Title I) must be amended to lay down clear rules for campaign financing, individual membership and joint financing. In addition, a legally binding code of conduct for EU politicians should be introduced in order to increase the transparency of
The aim is to increase awareness of the measures taken by EU politicians and the thinking behind them. A refinement of the
existing rules on the regulation of lobbies in the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament (2019) and in Articles 11 and 35 is also necessary. In order to combat corruption effectively, Regulation No 883/2013 of the European Union Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) must be amended to give the Office more investigative and enforcement powers.
In addition, the Commission's proposal for the inclusion of an EU ethics body must be implemented by amending Article 13 TEU. Furthermore, a more democratic and transparent Union also requires the protection of journalists, which can be achieved by adopting the proposed directive to combat abusive lawsuits, so-called "SLAPPs". In addition, the Whistleblower Directive (EU) 2019/1937 must be amended in order to offer more protection to whistleblowers who uncover abuses.
EU ethics body
 Although the European Commission has submitted a proposal for the establishment of an interinstitutional ethics body, this proposal lacks ambition. The ethics body should not consist mainly of representatives from different EU institutions, but should be chaired by independent ethics experts and should not only make recommendations, but also be given investigative and sanctioning powers in all areas for which it is responsible in order to simplify ethical regulations,

 Authorization of OLAF with extended investigative powers in these matters to address issues of financial misconduct.
Lobbying regulations
 Refinement of the existing lobbying rules in the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure and improvement of the criteria in the Transparency Register.
 Introduce measures to deter unchecked access, tighten registration requirements and establish a firm legal framework to ensure ethical behavior.
Safety and protection of journalists
 Revise the proposed SLAPPs (strategic lawsuits against public participation) directive, which targets abusive lawsuits against journalists and human rights defenders. Ensure that the directive contains adequate safeguards to protect individuals and organizations and defend fundamental rights. This includes environmental and climate rights, women's rights, LGB
TIQ rights, disability rights, the rights of ethnic minorities, labor rights and religious freedoms; the directive applies to all persons who are publicly involved in matters of public interest. Volt is actively working at European level to implement these rules.

9. Prioritize climate neutrality
We are creating a strong Europe that is fair to people and the environment and safeguards our fragile livelihoods. Climate neutrality is our priority and not a "niceto-have". We are joining forces and skills to build a climate-neutral Europe: by reducing all member states' net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2040. To achieve climate neutrality, we are not only relying on individual responsibility, but are also activating the major levers. This is because the responsibility lies with the perpetrators of the climate crisis, who have profited from climate and environmentally harmful production for years.
The dangers and threats posed by the climate crisis are undeniable. There is clear evidence that man-made climate change is leading to destabilization of weather patterns and the collapse of ecosystems. The human and economic costs of adapting to these negative consequences increase exponentially with each additional degree of global warming. It is widely recognized that the only way to mitigate the climate crisis is to rapidly and completely eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. But despite this clear political imperative, there is a lack of robust and ambitious climate policy, as other interests stand in the way of the transition to climate neutrality. Nevertheless, we must recognize the steps taken in the 2015 Paris Agreement as a diplomatic breakthrough in the fight against the climate crisis. Almost all countries committed to limiting global warming to 2°C and aiming for 1.5°C. This target should be achieved through rigorous and continuously reported Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). On this basis, we can drive forward an ambitious climate agenda and introduce additional aspects into international climate policy. One example of this is the establishment of a fund for loss and damage.
The EU has taken and proposed various measures to achieve net-to-zero emissions by 2050. Most recently, this concerned the "European Green Deal", which
"Fit for 55" legislation. This was a major step forward, but it is still not enough to achieve the climate targets. Volt is strongly c o m m i t t e d to bringing European policy in line with the Paris Agreement. This includes the EU doing its part to meet the 1.5 degree target.
The CO2 reductions that we can achieve by 2030 are crucial and have the highest priority. We will therefore advocate for an additional climate emergency law that aims to achieve the greatest possible CO2 reduction by 2030. Furthermore, the climate crisis is developing in parallel with significant inequalities. The richest 10% of Europeans emit more than three times as much greenhouse gases per capita as the rest. However, those who have contributed the least to the climate crisis are likely to suffer the most.

9.2 Just transition without harmful subsidies
 Extend the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to negative emissions and cover at least 90% (2021 approx. 40%) of all EU carbon emissions under a single cap by the end of 2025 at the latest. This means that the introduction of the planned ETS 2, which covers buildings, road transport and additional small industries and also includes emissions from industrial livestock farming, must be accelerated. A reduction in the number of certificates (adapted to the scope) in line with Volt's reduction targets is necessary.
 Extension of the Industrial Establishments Directive (IED) to all types of industrial animal husbandry. This refers to farms that keep a number of animals considered relevant by science.
 Introduction of a carbon tax for all sectors in which an extended ETS would cause a disproportionately high administrative burden (e.g.
highly fragmented industries that can hardly be identified in advance).
 Support the final implementation of a robust carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM).
 Ensure appropriate taxation of kerosene and other fossil fuels. This is one part of a broader just transition strategy that sets out clear and
provides for comprehensible targets for ending fossil fuel subsidies.
 Maintaining the high proportion of total revenue from the EU ETS that is used for climate and energy-related purposes (estimated at 75% between 2013 and 2021). At the same time, the aim is to ensure that this revenue is also used to support low-income communities and those most affected by the climate crisis. "Carbon dividends", i.e. direct cash payments to citizens, have become established in Switzerland and

> Increased efforts for sustainable forest management, restoration and reforestation.
> Commitment to the conservation and restoration of wetlands.
> Replace current subsidies for unsustainable agricultural practices with subsidies to encourage the rapid adoption of known or developing environmentally friendly practices (e.g. perennial agricultural production systems and polyculture).
> Promote the diversification of plant species that have a very high carbon sequestration per unit area and time and are a source of sustainable raw materials for a variety of value-added products, such as hemp and bamboo.
> 
Increase the number of protected wildlife areas in accordance with the UN Biodiversity Plan.
> Improve the protection and health of European waterways and develop a coherent strategy for the use of scientific knowledge, transnational cooperation and the creation of appropriate economic incentives.

 Strengthening and expanding the rail system in Europe, as more than 20% of CO2 emissions in the EU come from transportation, whether from road transport (72% of the total) or air transport (14%), while rail only accounts for 0.4% of carbon emissions. Here we propose
> Harmonization of infrastructure throughout Europe, in particular with regard to the European Train Control System (ETCS), platform height, track gauge and the approval of rail vehicles.
> Proposal for substantial EU-wide investments and subsidies at all levels of rail transport. This includes integrated long and medium distance networks for freight and passenger transport, a European high-speed rail network (HSR) and regional and local public transport. National and international night train services must be expanded and improved as a convenient alternative to air travel.
 Providing the proposed European Transport Agency (ETA, see "Act for a prosperous coexistence") with advisory legislative powers and financial resources. In this way, we want to monitor investments in the infrastructure of international high-speed trains throughout Europe and promote innovation and sustainability in the aviation and shipping industry.

9.7 Renewable energy systems
 Promoting changes in the energy supply mix and implementing alternative and carbon- free energy sources. The transition to a sustainable European system and the complete decarbonization of the energy system should be achieved by 2035.
> Promote the complete phase-out of coal combustion by 2030 (lignite by 2025) and ban new permits for drilling for fossil fuels and immediately stop flaring. It should also be ensured that 80 % of all known fossil fuel reserves remain in the ground. Advertising for fossil fuel products should be banned, similar to the example of cigarette advertising.
> Promotion of a diversified portfolio of renewable energy sources (RE). In order to enable a mix of intermittent and complementary sustainable energy sources, research into the conversion of ocean thermal energy, tidal and wave energy, residual heat from industry, biomass and new concepts for solar and wind energy should be promoted alongside research into geothermal energy.

Develop a differentiated European strategy that prioritizes decarbonization, ensures safety, introduces a concept for nuclear waste management and promotes research and development, taking advantage of long-term opportunities:
> Existing reactors should continue to be operated in their current form until the agreed end of their life cycle. The aim is to ensure that lifetime extensions are only permitted if, firstly, all safety regulations applicable at the time of the decision are met.
secondly, long-term operation is at the full cost of the operators, thirdly, the state of the art at the time of the assessment is achieved and fourthly, the reactor is needed to ensure climate neutrality.
> Construction and operation of already approved reactors within the scope of the contractual obligations agreed in each case.
> 
Approval of new reactors if they are proven to be inherently safe (no active safety systems required to bring operation to a safe shutdown state) and robust against external influences.
> Promote research and support the introduction of advanced nuclear fission and fusion concepts such as thorium cycles, molten salt, liquid metal, Gen4, fast breeder or small modular reactors.
> Promote the development of new infrastructure that enables the production of millions of tons of low- carbon hydrogen by 2040. This can contribute to the decarbonization of the European
industry and transportation systems, without affecting them financially.
> Replacing the use of natural gas in households with as much biogas as possible in the short and medium term. Biogas should be produced in the EU using innovative methods and transported to households via the same gas transmission infrastructure. We want to introduce price caps for EU biogas.

> Ensuring a high degree of market competition on the supply side through effective unbundling regulations and making it easier for consumers to switch providers.
> Guarantee that there are sufficient incentives for investment in new generation and infrastructure facilities required for the introduction of renewable energy systems.
> Maintaining effective economic use of generation and flexibility resources to meet energy demand at all times. To make this possible, cross-border trading capacity should be increased and more dynamic trading should be enabled (e.g. by reducing
minimum product quantities and trading hours).
> Improve the approach to incorporate the new market objectives and incentivize the introduction and effective operation of flexibility mechanisms (storage and
demand-side management). We want to introduce established central markets and decentralized market- oriented solutions that enable the introduction and operation of instruments for the locally required flexibility (e.g. local flexibility markets, aggregator business models).
> Consideration of the new framework conditions, which are primarily determined by three factors: Decentralization (redistribution and fragmentation of generation and flexibility resources), digitalization (improved monitoring and control) and democratization (more energy resources at the citizen and local level, empowering these local actors to participate more actively in energy systems).
 Propose a transitional period to take account of the complexity of identifying and implementing such far-reaching reform measures. We want to introduce short-term, possibly temporary measures to address issues where there is an urgent need for action. The general approach adopted by the Commission and endorsed by the Council should be followed:
> Improve investment conditions for renewable energy sources by expanding the use of contracts for difference and promoting the introduction of power purchase agreements.

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
The Volt Climate Transformation Act affects the directives and regulations that fall under the "European Great Deal" initiatives,
"Net Zero Emissions by 2050" and the "Just Transition Mechanism". In the chapter, we have advocated climate neutrality in various areas of climate policy, decarbonization, energy transition and sustainable development. This involves changes to the following three key legal instruments: Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 on EU climate law, Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the Renewable Energy Directive II and Directive (EU) 2022/2464 on corporate sustainability reporting.
At the same time, the measures relate to others that fall under the aforementioned initiatives.
The proposed measures have an impact on existing legislation. This is because they propose new, innovative measures that can resolve key problems. For example, Regulation (EU) 2021/1119
on EU climate law should be amended to take greater account of the wide disparities in greenhouse gas emissions within Europe, as these are clear inequalities (i.e. the richest 10% emit more than three times as much per capita as the poorest 10%).
much than any other). At the same time, Volt recognizes Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the Renewable Energy Directive II and adds to the already existing legislation the idea that decarbonization should not only take place at the production level, but also at the consumption level and across global supply chains. Only a few measures have an impact on Directive (EU) 2022/2464 on corporate sustainability reporting, as the articles drafted should focus more on the possibilities of green technologies. In particular, this relates to economic growth, job creation, the transition to a green economy and climate policy.

10. Healthy ecosystems
The environmental crisis we are facing goes beyond the climate crisis. It i n c l u d e s widespread pollution, the depletion of biodiversity and the destruction of our natural habitats. These problems are not isolated. They are caused by our unsustainable production and consumption patterns and the overstepping of our planet's natural limits.
To tackle these complex environmental challenges effectively, we need a comprehensive "One Health" approach and the involvement of all stakeholders. Tackling the climate crisis is inextricably linked to the preservation of vital natural ecosystems that serve as carbon reservoirs and the basis of our food supply. Furthermore, the destruction of these ecosystems makes us more vulnerable to increasing natural disasters such as floods and forest fires, which are already increasing at an alarming rate. Recognizing this would be the first step in a responsible policy.
Our actions have an impact on the health of the planet. At the same time, it is closely linked to human health. Increasing environmental pollution - from air pollution to soil and ocean contamination - is taking an ever greater toll on our wellbeing and placing an additional burden on our already overstretched healthcare systems.
We must no longer exploit the world and our ecosystems at all costs. But politicians are encouraging this with subsidies for harmful and polluting activities such as factory farming, deforestation, the excessive use of antimicrobials, overfishing and unsustainable consumption patterns. This makes it clear to us: we must act immediately. We must recognize that a harmonious coexistence of nature and humans is the only way for life to continue on this planet. We therefore believe that EU funds should focus on financing desirable practices and abolishing harmful subsidies and measures. We need to empower consumers to make more sustainable choices and promote circular consumption patterns to protect our natural world and its ecosystems. At the same time, other actors within the food chain must also be involved.
The first step towards more sustainable agriculture is crucial for the transition to a green economy. Of course, this is done in close cooperation with farmers. Small and medium-sized farmers' businesses are put under pressure by exploitative trade relations. This is reflected in the decline
of agricultural businesses in Europe. Reforms are urgently needed here. We want to offer farmers a better basis for their livelihoods, improve cooperation

between generations and boost the local economy. Rewarding farmers who work in harmony with nature is essential to creating a green future and securing an independent Europe. The need for change also extends to our forest and marine policies.
Together, these measures promote the development of resilient and sustainable communities. This is because they ensure that communities are equipped with accessible green spaces that enhance human well-being, improve animal welfare and combat antimicrobial resistance. This leads to the intertwining o f	human, animal and environmental health, benefiting public health, the well-being of present and future generations and all living organisms on this planet.

10.1 Nature Restoration Act
 Adapt the Nature Restoration Law (NRL) to environmental science, also taking into account the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on air pollution, green spaces in residential areas, chemicals and noise, and set ambitious targets for all natural areas in need of restoration:
> Rewetting of at least 30 %
of peatlands in the EU by 2030.
> Conversion of at least 10 % of urban areas into green and blue areas (open streams, rivers, ponds and lakes) by 2040 and at least 15 % by 2050 and their legal protection.
> Extension of the NRL to the habitats of fish species that are in a critical state.
> At least 10 % of every farm is to be used for nature restoration by 2030.
> 
Pursuing a One Health approach by following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines involves maintaining strict air quality standards that ensure the right and freedom of all people to breathe clean air and limiting long-term exposure to pollutants such as PM2.5 and NO2 across Europe by ensuring that levels do not exceed 5 µg/m³ PM2.5 and 10 µg/ m³ NO2.

10.2 Ecosystems of the oceans
 Discontinuation of the use of fishing gear that has undesirable negative impacts on ecosystems, such as the destruction of corals and the capture of unintended species (bycatch), as well as a ban on destructive practices such as bottom trawling, starting in marine protected areas (MPAs). Also the abolition of harmful subsidies, in particular the exemption from fuel tax.
 Adaptation of fishing quotas to the recommendations of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which will officially accompany the decision-making process. We therefore call for transparency and accountability to apply to non-public Council meetings at which Member States' final quotas are set (which often exceed the recommended limits).
 Support small-scale fisheries through fair incentives under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The aim is to enable it to participate effectively in the political decision-making process, as it plays an important role in the livelihoods of coastal communities and the local economy and is known to have a lower environmental impact than large-scale fishing.
 Support strong mechanisms and deterrent penalties to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. In this context, effective cooperation with third countries to restore marine stocks and protect MPAs is also crucial.
 
Only support sustainable aquaculture. EU funds may only be used for truly sustainable aquaculture practices. In parallel, policy measures will aim to bring general food consumption to a sustainable level.
 Strengthen legislation on aquaculture and its effluents and wastes to avoid disruptive nutrient gradients and promote a sustainable, circular and biodiversity-friendly form o f aquaculture.
 Creation of an action plan to promote the sustainable production of algae and to promote the innovative use of products made with this protein. Europe consumes large quantities of algae, but 97% of the world's production comes from Asia. There is a clear opportunity for strategic auto nomy that can be fulfilled by creating realistic conditions for the algae sector to take off, including funding, investment in R&D and increasing consumer awareness and acceptance of algae products in the EU.

10.3 Restoration of forests
 Promotion of natural carbon storage through increased efforts for sustainable forest management,
-restoration and reforestation. Agricultural and forestry practices should focus on reducing emissions and preserving the landscape. The aim is to restore carbon stocks in Europe to pre-industrial levels and combat desertification.
 Commitment to the conservation and restoration of wetlands. We want to focus on peatlands (which can store twice as much carbon as forests) by imposing an immediate moratorium on peat extraction. This should continue until the legal regulations have been tightened. In this way, we want to ensure the protection of the areas and their sustainable management. At the same time, we want to promote the active restoration of the natural state of already exploited peatlands.
 
Improving the protection and health of European waterways.
We want to achieve this by updating the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and accelerating their implementation, as only 40% of the surface water bodies examined by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2018 were in good ecological status.
 Creation of an EU-wide action plan for the forestry sector. This is intended to support an ecosystem-based approach to forest management, as it is possible and necessary to reconcile nature conservation with the commercial use of forest resources. This approach aims to respect the natural cycle of forests as much as possible, contribute to the protection and restoration of forests in the EU and provide forest owners with a more sustainable source of income.

10.4 Social reform of the common agricultural policy
 Support for more in-depth monitoring of the EU food market, as food is an essential commodity. This should protect consumers and ensure stable and fair prices for farmers. The aim is to create a framework for fair individual trade agreements, a mechanism for local and direct sales regulations and improved anti-dumping measures and monitoring. This should include an examination of competition and pricing practices. Small and medium-sized farms face particular challenges due to exploitative relationships with retailers, corporate control and WTO pricing issues. They are confronted with high production costs and long-standing CAP policies that prevent fairness and sustainability.
 Support the establishment of local agricultural cooperatives in order to stabilize food prices, guarantee farmers a stable and fair income and promote local supply chains. We want to define guidelines for the Member States to promote the establishment of agricultural cooperatives at national level. At the same time, an EU-wide public platform for knowledge and information for consumers and producers should be established.
 Adopt EU-wide measures to reduce production costs for farmers and the additional price that consumers pay for healthier and more sustainable food.
pay for more sustainable food. We want to achieve this by rebalancing production subsidies in the common agricultural policy.
 Simplify bureaucratic procedures and increase transparency for recipients of CAP funds, especially for small and medium-sized farms. We want to achieve this by providing access to a central and intuitive EU platform for the exchange of knowledge and advice on procedures, rights and obligations, agricultural practices and the submission of documents. We want to work together with the relevant national ministries to achieve this.
 Training of the staff of the relevant national ministries so that they can help farmers with their questions appropriately.
 Adequate support for small and medium- sized farms and stronger incentives for young farmers to stay in business. This should also benefit new entrants, especially women*, in order to ensure the generational succession of farmers. The annual direct payment framework of the member states for generational renewal measures is to be increased from 3% to 6%.
 Development of a sub-program for trainees, newcomers or agriculture in general, for exchange within the framework of Erasmus, which focuses on sustainable agricultural practices.

10.5 Environmental reform of the common agricultural policy
 Abolition of subsidies for environmentally harmful agricultural practices and payments per hectare of land. These funds should be allocated to desirable agricultural practices. In doing so, we want to support the transition to a regenerative farming model that strongly promotes sustainable and organic food, the restoration of soil health, the reduction of pesticides, sustainable water and land use, the reversal of biodiversity loss and animal welfare. Guidance and financial support for farmers during this transition period must be guaranteed to ensure their stability and income.
 Promote rural development models that stimulate local supply chains by harmonizing overarching policy areas. For example, an effective transport system provides incentives for people to move to rural areas and supports farmers and local supply chains. The green agricultural transition also offers opportunities for the repopulation of rural areas as it creates new green jobs and attracts skilled young people.
 Creating incentives to reduce the number of animals kept, while at the same time limiting meat imports and adjusting the demand for meat through accompanying measures. Agriculture is responsible for
10.3 % of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, 70 % of these
emissions come from the livestock sector. We need "less but better quality" meat if we want to return to a sustainable level of consumption and at the same time maintain the profitability of

 Support research and development for innovative green energy-powered farming systems such as vertical farming and hydroponics in urban areas to ensure more sustainable and shorter food supply chains.
 Promote precision farming and farm automation where appropriate to reduce dependence on inputs (such as water and pesticides) and make agricultural practices environmentally sustainable. Promote cross-generational renewal of farmers by recruiting highly qualified people.

 Support the European Commission's goal of reducing the use of chemical pesticides by 50% by 2030 while promoting the spread of integrated pest management (IPM) practices to reduce the need for pesticides and support other agro-ecological practices.
 Increased financial incentives under the common agricultural policy for the conversion of farms in order to achieve the Green Deal target of 25% organic farmland by 2030.
 
Use of the "eco-schemes" of the common agricultural policy, many of the proposed agro-ecological measures of which meet the requirements of organic farming. Organic farmland accounted for only 9.1% of the EU's total agricultural area in 2020 (5.8% in 2012), meaning that the EU will only reach 15% organic farmland by 2031 if growth continues at the same rate as 2012-2020.

 Harmonization of European policy to switch to a healthy diet. This should be rich in plant-based foods and contain less animal- based foods. This has a positive effect on health and the environment. An EU action plan should shape our food system and
habits to meet nutritional and environmental science recommendations, as Denmark has recently done. Subsidies and consumption targets should be adjusted to increase the proportion of plant-based foods and reduce the proportion of animal proteins.
 Adaptation of market mechanisms for better access and more favorable prices for plant proteins along the food chain. This should create a level playing field for these foodstuffs. We want to realign the common agricultural policy to favor products that are less emission-intensive than foods of animal origin.
 EU-wide measures under the Common Agricultural Policy to reduce the cost of healthy and sustainable food, including plant-based food.
 Binding EU guidelines on green procurement for public catering services (including
of the EU institutions). The guidelines set targets for the weekly availability (and often exclusivity) of plant-based dishes, food waste and organic content. Resources for the corresponding training of chefs are to be created.
 Increase funding for research and the development of healthy plant-based alternatives, as this sector is still largely underfunded compared to animal alternatives.
 Restriction of EU marketing aid to foods that we should consume more of according to nutritional and environmental science.
 Expand the "EU School Programs for Fruit, Vegetables and Milk" to include healthy plant-based alternatives to milk. In this way, we want to cater for children with allergies, other preferences or ethical concerns and promote a more sustainable diet. Increase EU R&D investment in cultured meat, seafood and other animal products and other relevant food technologies to accelerate their research and development. This can be crucial to making our food system more environmentally sustainable.

10.8 Strengthening consumer rights
 Uniform and mandatory labeling of foodstuffs with regard to origin and production methods. The same applies to processed food and meals sold in public establishments and restaurants. For animal products, including processed products, rearing, transport and slaughter conditions must be classified and labeled as mandatory. The same applies to the nutritional value of foodstuffs.
 Introduction of an EU-wide quality label (with a points system) for the eco- logical sustainability of products, including food. Environmental parameters such as carbon emissions, pesticide use and air pollution are taken into account.
 
Sustainability, recyclability and circular economy information for textiles to reduce waste, promote a circular economy and incentivize eco-friendly designs.
 Promotion of organic and regenerative agriculture through communication campaigns to attract more consumers and new farmers. These are financed, for example, via the
EU funding programs.

10.9 Animal welfare on farms
 Revision of the current EU animal welfare legislation, which is scientifically outdated, excludes many farm animal species and is inadequately enforced:
> Inclusion of species-specific and scientific laws covering all animals bred or kept by humans, including aquatic animals.
> Abolition of long-distance transportation of animals to non-EU countries and introduction of strict limits within the EU based on species-specific and scientifically justified minimum standards. Instead, we are in favor of the transport of meat/carcasses and genetic material and the promotion of local and mobile slaughterhouses. We want to introduce a strict and transparent monitoring and reporting system in order to effectively identify, prevent and sanction violations.
> End fur production in the EU and ban imports of fur products from third countries.
> 
Abolition of the keeping of animals in individual cages in agriculture.
> Prohibition of shredding and gassing of male chicks and transition to technologies that determine sex before hatching. Sex determination in the womb is already being introduced in some Member States.
> Immediate ban on the routine docking of pigs' tails, which is still routinely carried out in most Member States 15 years after an EU-wide ban came into force. Severe sanctions are imposed for non- compliance.
> Ban on the breeding of fast-growing breeds for reasons of profitability. This leads to suffering and health problems for the animals.
> Introduction of mandatory video surveillance in slaughterhouses to improve enforcement of animal welfare regulations.

10.10 General animal welfare
 Ban on the breeding and use of wild animals for entertainment purposes. This includes use in circuses, bullfights and similar events, aquariums/dolphinariums and zoos. A transitional period is to be granted during which the facilities can adapt their business and bring the wild animals used for entertainment purposes together with rescue centers.
 Combating the illegal pet trade in the EU. We want to implement legal provisions for the licensing and registration of pet breeders. At the same time, we are committed to the development of a
EU database for the mandatory registration (e.g. by microchip) of pets (e.g. dogs, cats and ferrets).
 EU-wide ban on the breeding of physically impaired domestic animal breeds with chronic health and animal welfare problems.
 
Increase funding for research into alternatives to animal testing. To this end, a roadmap with clear targets for the reduction, improvement and replacement of animal testing should be drawn up. The EU must do more to meet its commitments on the use of animals in scientific experiments. Over 10 million animals are still tested every year.
 Regulation of the trade in exotic pets through an EU-wide positive list. This serves to protect biodiversity, human health and the health of other animals. The list specifies exactly which animal species may be traded as pets.
 Inclusion of animal welfare in the job title of the responsible EU Commissioner in order to increase institutional accountability and emphasize the importance of the issue.

EUROPEAN ELECTION PROGRAM 2024-2029 A PLANET WORTH LIVING ON
10.11 Antibiotic resistance
 Development of an EU-wide binding and scientifically based system for the use of antibiotics in human medicine. First-line therapy must be defined uniformly for certain diseases. This will restrict the use of antibiotics in cases where they are not necessary.
 Regulations that only permit the use of antibiotics in the veterinary sector in emergencies.
 Expansion of ongoing R&D initiatives for new treatment approaches and medical technology.
 
Reducing the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry:
> Reduction in the number of animals of different origins in a herd (e.g.
B. calf rearing). Resistance occurs are particularly common.
> Support initiatives to reduce intensive livestock farming.
> A greater diversity of animal breeds must be maintained in order to prevent the occurrence and spread of diseases and to build up more resistant herds.
> EU-wide education and training programs for farmers on the use of antimicrobial agents.

10.12 Pricing
 Ensuring that the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) includes land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Each Member State is treated as an individual emitter. The control is carried out at EU level, whereby the individual Member States can take their respective circumstances into account and pursue their own strategy.
 Taxing agricultural emissions from livestock farming and land use at source, as they are local and fragmented. Other non-sector- specific emissions in the agricultural sector (such as electricity and tractor fuels) are to be covered by the ETS. This takes place in processing or at the consumer level.
 
Extension of the ETS system to livestock farming, as pollution in this sector must also be taken into account.
 Extension of the Industrial Establishments Directive (IED) to all types of industrial livestock farming. This refers to farms that keep a number of animals considered relevant by the scientific community.

10.13 Transparency, monitoring and reporting
 Expansion of the Climate-ADAPT platform into an EU-wide harmonized real
The EU's climate emergency response and decision support system, as it currently only serves as a knowledge base for data and best practices to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis. Establish an early warning system for extreme weather events and create an interface with the European Emergency Response Coordination Center and national governments to coordinate public aid.
 
Establish a comprehensive assessment system for monitoring ecosystem health and resilience that identifies areas in need of restoration. Application to all EU territories and visualization via an interactive map that contains regularly updated data and is publicly available online. Link this assessment system to the Climate-ADAPT platform.

How do we bring these proposals to the European Parliament?
The Healthy Ecosystems Act affects the directives and regulations that fall under the European Green Deal, Air Quality and Pollution Control, Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), Circular Economy and One Health Approach initiatives. The package of measures relates to the improvement of air quality, the reduction of pollution, sustainable agriculture and waste management and the interlinking of human, animal and environmental health. It requires amendments to the following legal instruments: Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU), Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC), Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC).
We call for a special focus on the interconnected environmental challenges. We recognize that tackling the climate crisis is inextricably linked to the preservation of vital ecosystems (e.g. carbon sinks, food supply). As such, we are pushing for changes to the articles that address these issues under Directive 2008/50/EC on air quality and climate change.
clean air for Europe. In addition, the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010/75/EU) must make a stronger call to move away from exploitative activities and unsustainable consumption.
Finally, it should protect natural resources, reverse biodiversity loss, mitigate the climate crisis and promote resilient and sustainable communities that improve human, animal and environmental health. In doing so, we promote things that benefit current and future generations and the entire ecosystem. The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) and the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC) call for more attention to be paid to reversing biodiversity loss and promoting sustainable communities. This is to be achieved by reducing pollution from waste production and disposal. We support a revision of existing animal welfare legislation, including Council Directive 98/58/EC on the protection of animals. We are also committed to harmonizing the law on the restoration of nature and environmental science.

EUROPEAN ELECTION PROGRAM 2024
of the Alliance for Innovation & Justice (BIG Party)
Preamble
Dear voters,
For almost 60 years now, European unity has been the guarantor of peace and prosperity in Europe. However, the geopolitical developments of recent years present the Union with unprecedented challenges and dangers. Great Britain will be the first member state to leave the European Union. Right-wing conservative and nationalist movements are gaining strength in many European countries and are increasingly calling the continued existence of European unification into question with their populist and reactionary demands. In some member states, these forces have even been elected to government. National interests are once again being placed above the European common good, while at the same time the democratic rule of law is being eroded by authoritarian means in certain member states. Transatlantic relations are in a serious crisis and international trade is increasingly determined by protectionism. Wars and humanitarian disasters continue to drive many people seeking protection to Europe.
In this critical overall situation, we as the BIG Party are unreservedly committed to European unity. The further political weakening of the EU as an economic area will inevitably lead to social upheaval in the member states. Social peace can only be secured in the long term through social peace. Separatism, division and small statehood inevitably lead to territorial conflicts and wars. European history has amply demonstrated this.
Being committed to Europe does not mean that grievances within the EU and its institutions should not be addressed. Constructive criticism and proposals for renewal even become an obligation in order to ensure the continued existence of the European Union. This is the only way to effectively counter the widespread disenchantment with the EU and nationalist and extremist tendencies.
Europe needs new approaches and ideas. We stand for a European Union in which the institutions work transparently for the common good of all EU citizens. All people must have an appropriate share in prosperity and social security. Individual fundamental and human rights must be guaranteed, regardless of status, origin, descent or gender. Global challenges such as migration, climate protection and digitalization require sustainable, responsible and ethical concepts.
Give us your vote - for an open, modern and fair Europe, a Europe of diversity, equal opportunities and justice!

Migration and refugee policy
Europe needs a humane and fair refugee policy. Asylum procedures must be simplified and accelerated, and illegal migration must be effectively curbed.
Reform of the Dublin system: faster decisions, fairer distribution
The Dublin system, according to which refugees must submit their asylum application in the country of first arrival, no longer works in its current form. The reception and distribution procedures must therefore be fundamentally reformed. We call for refugees to be distributed among the member states on the basis of their status. Connecting factors such as a previous stay in a Member State or family ties must be given priority. If such circumstances do not exist, the distribution must take place according to a fair distribution key within the EU countries. In a community, all members must meet their obligations; those who violate this principle of solidarity must be sanctioned economically, e.g. by the dispersal of funding.
Asylum procedures must also be simplified and accelerated, but with individual legal remedies preserved. People who do not have the right to stay are also entitled to legal certainty quickly. Family reunions must be carried out more quickly, and procedures must focus in particular on applications from minors seeking protection. They need special protection and increased care, for example through the provision of accompanying persons.
Internal security: strengthen borders, reduce fears
Internal security is one of the most important concerns of the people in the member states. Citizens' fears and irrational ideas must be allayed. Migration is not a threat, but a necessity from which society benefits. In view of population growth and the rampant shortage of skilled workers, there is no alternative to managed migration. Immigrants bring cultural diversity, labor and consumer power to the member states and create new social impulses. We must finally put an end to populist politics being carried out on the backs of migrants and people seeking protection. Scaremongering, agitation and deliberate misinformation divide society and exacerbate EU scepticism.
On the other hand, citizens must also have the feeling that governments are taking targeted and consistent action against illegal migration. The external borders must therefore be protected even more effectively. Migrants who are required to leave the country must be returned to their country of origin, but each case must be examined very carefully. Compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights must be ensured at all costs. Voluntary departures are
5
Deportations are always preferable, as they are typically associated with hardship. Voluntary return can be effectively supported through improved exit counseling. Deportations to war zones such as Syria or Afghanistan must be avoided as they violate fundamental human rights.
Immigration: promoting participation, ensuring equal opportunities
The influx of immigrants must not lead to the existing population suffering social disadvantages. Where there is competition for societal and social resources, immigration will always remain an issue of conflict. Sufficient childcare facilities must therefore be created, and the housing market and job creation must be particularly promoted. In addition, social entitlements and longer residence rights for immigrants should be linked to employment and a minimum length of stay.
But participation must also be further promoted. We need a framework that ensures that immigrants learn German quickly. Language courses must be compulsory and made available in sufficient numbers. This is the only way to enable access to the social environment and the labor market. In addition, the support and accompanying programs to promote participation must be further expanded and improved. Participation is a task for society as a whole that can only succeed with the efforts of all those involved.
Causes of flight: Prevent isolation, create safe living conditions
fen
Europe must not close itself off. In view of Europe's colonial history, there is an ethical co-responsibility for the precarious living conditions in many developing countries. A protectionist refugee policy is immoral and unworthy of an alliance of democratic industrialized countries. Every year, thousands of people seeking protection die on their way to Europe, most of them in the Mediterranean. Basic human rights oblige us to help these people, without ifs and buts. An EU-wide, coordinated system for sea rescue must therefore be installed immediately. Private aid organizations must not be harassed and criminalized.
The focus in combating the causes of flight must be on cooperation with third countries. Refugee routes must not be closed at all costs; compliance with basic human rights and procedural standards must also be guaranteed in third countries. Safe living conditions must be created in countries where people make their way to Europe due to a lack of social and economic prospects. Development aid and economic support must be focused on creating sustainable and humane living conditions. This requires in particular
6
fair trade relations in order to keep the markets in third countries competitive.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 A humane and fair refugee policy
 Reform of the Dublin system, improved asylum procedures, fair distribution rules
 Internal security through stronger borders, effective containment of illegal immigration
 Socially responsible migration and increased participation efforts
 Responsibility for people in need, creating safe living conditions
Anti-discrimination policy
We want an equal Europe in which all citizens are guaranteed equal opportunities and all forms of discrimination are effectively combated.
Equal opportunities: quotas for women and early childhood support
Equal access for citizens to all areas of public life is one of the main pillars of a democratic society. All people must have the same opportunities to access education, the labor market, social services and benefits as well as the housing market. Experience shows that although equal opportunities largely exist on paper, they are often not implemented accordingly in practice. Much greater legislative efforts are required here. For example, women still suffer considerable disadvantages in education and employment, especially when it comes to promotion and pay. We therefore call for binding quotas for women in public administration and the private sector in all member states. Single mothers must also be particularly encouraged and supported, as they and their children are most at risk of poverty. The inclusion of people with disabilities in all public areas must be further improved. Citizens with a migration background must be effectively protected from discrimination when looking for work and housing. Early childhood support for children with a migrant background is a key factor in ensuring equal starting conditions for school education.
Anti-discrimination: better protection for victims, consistent punishment for perpetrators
The unequal treatment of certain groups of people without cause undermines the foundation of social coexistence. We therefore strictly oppose all forms of discrimination and racism. The protection of women and girls from sexual violence must be further strengthened. State prevention programs must be expanded and private counselling services must be better supported. Trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation m u s t b e prosecuted throughout Europe and
7
be sanctioned under criminal law. The right to sexual self-determination must be guaranteed and protected.
Misanthropy and hatred must be countered at all levels of society. Increasing racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are poisoning the social climate in many European countries. Morals are increasingly deteriorating and verbal and physical attacks against people of other origins or religions are becoming more frequent. We call for a social culture of fairness, mutual respect and appreciation as well as responsible and dignified interaction with one another. We also call for a transparent and strict approach by the criminal investigation and prosecution authorities. Hate crimes must not be trivialized and the public must be adequately informed and sensitized. We demand an improvement in victim protection, for example through the establishment of municipal advice centers.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 Equal opportunities and equal treatment
 Strengthening women's rights and early childhood development
 Fight against discrimination, racism, hatred and misanthropy
 Consistent criminal prosecution and improved victim protection
Social and Labor market policy
Only social justice can secure social peace in the long term. We need binding guidelines in the area of basic social security and the minimum wage. Employment must be secured and promoted, and youth unemployment must be combated effectively.
Social standards: basic security and minimum wage
Lasting peace and fairly distributed prosperity are the greatest promises of European unity. Social justice is the cornerstone of social peace. A lack of social security and unemployment always lead to social upheaval, which paves the way for extremism and anti-democratic sentiment. It must therefore be the top priority of common policy to create and enforce minimum social standards in the member states.
These minimum standards include adequate basic security benefits for pensioners. People who have worked all their lives must not spend their old age in poverty. A universal minimum wage must also be introduced in every Member State. Countries such as Italy, Sweden and Austria still have no such provisions. Where regulations do exist, there are considerable differences in the level stipulated. We therefore call for the swift
8
Creation of binding guidelines for fair and appropriate remuneration in all member states.
It will only be possible to harmonize living conditions in the member states in the long term if appropriate social standards are laid down. If the differences remain, phenomena such as social migration and wage dumping cannot be contained.
Labor market: strengthening employment, combating youth unemployment Employment is the foundation of the welfare state. However, employment rates currently vary considerably within the member states. While unemployment figures in Germany and other central European countries have been falling for years, southern and western European countries such as Spain and Italy continue to have major problems. This is particularly true in the area of youth unemployment. In Greece and Spain, one in three young people is without training or a job. The EU must therefore make every effort to improve employment conditions in the problem countries. Qualification and support programmes must be expanded and working conditions made more flexible. Deregulation must be driven forward and new markets opened up.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 Minimum social standards for uniform living conditions
 Binding requirements for basic income support and minimum wage
 Strengthening employment and combating youth unemployment
Financial and Economic policy
An end to privileges and tax loopholes for large companies. The financial market, which has hardly been taxed to date, must finally contribute to the common good in an appropriate form. An EU-wide financial transaction tax is overdue.
Corporations: close tax loopholes
Europe needs fair taxation. While every hard-working citizen and every small or medium-sized company pays their taxes on income and profits at their place of work as a matter of course, large companies can shift their earnings to low-tax countries and pay taxes there. This form of tax dumping must finally be stopped. Corporations that generate billions in profits must also pay their taxes where they work and use the existing infrastructures. The first steps towards curbing tax avoidance have already been taken with an EU directive. However, the regulations are still far from sufficient. Taxation regulations must be standardized in the member states and competition law must b e tightened.
9
to be able to take effective action against the tax avoidance strategies of large corporations.
Financial transaction tax: making the financial market more accountable
As the financial markets have hardly been taxed to date, the introduction of a transaction tax for financial transactions is urgently overdue. As early as 2012, 11 member states agreed in principle to introduce a corresponding financial transaction tax across all countries. However, the tax has not yet been implemented as the states have been unable to agree on a specific form. This political stalemate must finally come to an end. Every year without a tax costs citizens billions of euros. According to calculations, the planned moderate financial transaction tax would bring in a good 50 billion euros a year for the member states. In view of the fact that the EU states supported the financial sector with around 4.6 trillion euros during the economic and banking crisis from 2008 to 2010, this tax would only be a drop in the ocean. The financial transaction tax must therefore be introduced promptly and set at a significantly higher rate. With a tax rate of just 0.5% on trading in shares, annual revenues of a good 250 billion euros could be realized. The financial markets must finally be held more accountable; those who claim trillions of taxpayers' money in times of crisis must also make an appropriate contribution to the common good in times of growth.
White-collar crime: draining tax havens, reducing	tax evasion
insulate
Every year, the member states of the European Union suffer billions in losses due to tax evasion, particularly in the area of VAT. These illegal activities can only be countered efficiently by creating a single VAT area within the EU. The Commission's efforts to this end must be supported at national level. In addition, efforts to drain tax havens must be further expanded. The exchange of information between countries on financial accounts needs to be further improved and tax evaders must be sanctioned more effectively. Only by curbing illegal money flows can crimes such as drug trafficking, terrorist financing and money laundering be effectively combated.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 Tax justice and reduction of privileges for large corporations
 A financial transaction tax and more financial responsibility on the part of the financial sector
 Effective fight against white-collar crime
10
Alliance policy
The disenchantment with the EU and its institutions is largely homemade. Processes need to be simplified and made more transparent, and citizens need more opportunities to have a say. The influence of lobby associations must be reduced. Fair standards must be applied to EU enlargement.
European institutions: Strengthening opportunities to have a say
More and more people have the impression that the EU has largely withdrawn itself from the influence of its citizens. While the influence of business and industry is steadily increasing, the participation of citizens seems to be limited to their opportunity to vote every four years. It is understandable that people are therefore increasingly turning away from the EU and consider its institutions to be corrupt. The existing right of the European Citizens' Initiative has hardly been used to date, and simplifications are urgently needed here. The procedures must be simplified and the bureaucratic hurdles reduced. We call for a reduction in the minimum number of supporting signatures, an extension of the collection period and a lowering of the participation age to 16. In addition, the Member States must inform citizens better about the existing opportunities for participation.
Lobbying: limiting the influence of organizations
Political and economic power must be clearly separated in Europe. The transparency register that has already been introduced is an important step, but it has hardly had any effect in its current form. The biggest problem continues to be that participation in the register is not mandatory. The data stored there is also largely incorrect and incomplete. We are therefore calling for the register to finally be implemented effectively. This requires an extension of the scope of application to all EU institutions, including the Council of the European Union, the Council of Ministers and the permanent representations of the Member States. The verification and sanctioning system must be improved so that incorrect data can be tracked down and those responsible can be punished. In addition, client protection must be restricted so that lobby groups cannot hide behind confidentiality rules. Only by creating a comprehensive and robust transparency register will it be possible in the long term to effectively prevent undue influence and conflicts of interest in the institutions.
Enlargement policy: a sense of proportion and equal treatment
The enlargement of the European Union is a necessary process, as it secures peace and promotes progress and prosperity in Europe. EU accession countries are rightly required to meet certain minimum requirements in the areas of the rule of law, freedom of the press and the fight against crime and terrorism.
11
the fight against corruption. These accession requirements are precisely defined in the Copenhagen criteria. However, negotiations with the countries that have been offered the prospect of accession must also be conducted fairly and on an equal footing. This applies to the countries of the Western Balkans - Serbia, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia - as well as to Turkey.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 Strengthening citizen participation
 Improving transparency and weakening the influence of lobby groups
 Solid and fair enlargement policy
Foreign and trade policy
European foreign and defense policy must be geared towards securing peace. Clear responses are also needed to the global rise in protectionism. Arms deliveries to crisis areas must be consistently prevented. Trade agreements with developing and emerging countries must serve economic and social development.
Foreign policy: securing peace, strengthening defense
The focus of European foreign and defense policy must be on maintaining friendly relations with neighbors and securing partnerships. In times when the familiar world order is eroding, the EU must take responsibility and defend its values. It would be naïve to think that this could be achieved without modern and effective armed forces. Diplomacy is the silver bullet, but it cannot be successfully pursued without a solid deterrent. With the United States increasingly loosening its ties with Europe, the Union must improve its own defense capabilities. The defense resources of the member states do not necessarily have to be increased, but they should be deployed in a more targeted manner as part of a European defense strategy.
Trade policy: fair trade relations, not exporting war
International trade must be based on fairness and be conducted on an equal footing. The rise of protectionism and unfair trade practices pose new challenges that must be met with a policy of strength. Where diplo- macy and old alliances no longer help, new alliances must also be considered.
Trade with emerging and developing countries requires particular sensitivity; the EU must not exploit its superior economic position to the detriment of these countries. Trade agreements must therefore always be aimed at creating sustainable

production and supply conditions in third countries. The demanded complete opening of the markets in Africa must be rejected, as the producers there would not be able to compete with European suppliers and would inevitably be driven to ruin. The flooding of local markets with cheap goods must stop, as must the empty fishing of local coastal regions.
Peace is one of the most important achievements of European unification. However, securing peace must not only be a central goal within the Community, but also outside it. The EU must therefore make every possible effort to contribute to international conflict and crisis management. Peace diplomacy is essential for this, but the first essential step is to consistently prevent the supply of war equipment to crisis regions. All attempts to secure peace are implausible if armaments continue to be exported from member states to war zones on a large scale. We therefore call for the establishment of a strict EU-wide arms supply control system so that such exports can be effectively prevented and violations can be severely sanctioned. The Community must also continue to stand up for global nuclear disarmament and limit the expansion of autonomous weapons systems.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 Securing peace and strengthening defense capabilities
 Fair and sustainable trade relations
 Stop arms deliveries to crisis regions
Environmental protection and energy policy
As one of the greatest challenges of our time, climate protection can only be solved globally. The cornerstone for this lies in energy policy. Environmentally harmful energy sources such as coal must be reduced and alternative energies must be consistently promoted.
Environmental protection: Advancing environmental protection globally, protecting resources and the climate
Healthy habitats are the basis of human existence. Wherever the earth is exploited and natural resources are destroyed, this results in global change. A responsible environmental protection policy can therefore not end at the EU's external borders. It must be the declared aim of Community policy to ensure that the strict environmental protection requirements of the Member States are also enforced globally. Important measures in the areas of production, agriculture and mobility are technologically and financially costly. Emerging and developing countries must therefore be supported economically in the creation of responsible ecological development. Ethical ecology also means that economically important resources must be used in a sustainable manner.
13
third countries should not be ruthlessly exploited. Similarly, waste disposal and recycling problems must not be exported to the third world.
Climate change is the best example of the global impact of human activity. Only with the combined efforts and goodwill of all nations can the advancing climate change be countered in a promising way. The EU must exhaust all diplomatic and economic means to persuade unwilling states to participate in climate protection agreements. The Paris climate targets must be strictly pursued and adhered to.
Energy policy: strengthen alternative energies, reduce coal power
The future belongs to alternative and renewable energies; environmentally harmful energies must be consistently reduced. Coal energy is harmful to the climate and to health. While many European countries are already pursuing a clear exit policy in this area, Germany is clinging to this anachronistic form of energy generation. The situation is different with nuclear energy. While Germany is implementing the agreed phase-out, countries such as France are pushing ahead with the construction of new nuclear reactors. We are therefore calling for a uniform European energy directive that makes the rapid phase-out of both forms of energy generation mandatory. Europe must also continue to emancipate itself in the energy sector and reduce its dependence on energy exports.
Research into and the expansion of renewable energies, on the other hand, must continue to be driven forward and promoted. On a European basis, this also means ensuring consistent availability at a stable price level. Further networking of energy supply systems and energy storage structures is required here.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 Global environmental and resource protection
 Strengthening renewable energies
Research and Technology policy
Europe must remain competitive. This requires increased efforts in the area of research and further development. Digitalization must be shaped responsibly and in the interests of the common good.
Research: strengthening innovation, promoting sustainable technologies
In terms of innovation and development, Europe still has a lot of catching up to do in a global comparison. The USA and China continue to set the tone, especially when it comes to the development of new technologies. Efforts within the Community must be stepped up here in order to avoid f a l l i n g behind in the long term. Funds for research and technology development
14
must therefore be significantly increased. There is also a need for better cooperation and coordination in important research projects. The support of resource-saving and sustainable technologies should be at the forefront of this.
Digitalization: protect individual rights, prevent data monopolies
The rapidly advancing digital innovation offers people many opportunities, but it also harbors risks. We must use the advantages of digitalization in the interests of society, for example in the areas of environmental protection, transport planning and labour markets. Thanks to improved technologies, the added value of work performance has increased many times over in recent years. Where this leads to the loss of necessary human resources, social and societal compensation concepts are required. We reject digitalization at any price. It must be compatible with society as a whole and must not undermine individual rights. Above all, this means preventing the emergence of data monopolies. An important step in this direction would be to create universally accessible data infrastructures.
With your vote you decide in favor of:
 Strengthening innovation and promoting sustainable technologies
 Responsible digitalization, prevention of data monopolies
